Living in Manhattan doesn't allow for a lot of space. I live in a
reasonably sized (for Manhattan standards) apartment with  my wife and
son. My daughter doesn't live with us but she comes down most every
day and works out of her old room as a change of pace rather than
staying in her apartment and working alone. That leaves us with 4
people sharing space. 

There's no room for a real studio as space is at a premium but if you
want to paint regularly you don't want to spend 30 minutes doing set
up and tear down. I had a french style easel from when I was Bob Ross
for Halloween

and it worked well for that with the storage drawer and extending legs
but at home, not so much. The telescoping legs that set to a triangle
made for a much larger footprint than was necessary. After deciding I
was going to stick with this a while, I ended up getting this:

It seems bigger but the footprint is smaller. 

I got this branded as a DaVinci easel but there are a bunch out
there. I like the shelf on the bottom and I got a couple of hanging
baskets to attach to the back to hold paintbrushes which a keep in
used tomato cans that I've washed out. :

I throw a cheap plastic tablecloth over the dining table behind the
easel and that's where I put my equipment when I work.

I also needed a place to store paintings while they dried. For that I
got this rack:

I got mt easel and rack at Jerry's Artorama. I'll write about them in
the supplies post. I also got a couple of [[https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Vinyl-Hard-Floor-Chair/dp/B07PGN63W5/ref=pd_rhf_ee_s_rp_c_2_0_1/134-3759504-0733668?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07PGN63W5&pd_rd_r=4c9e6ee5-bea1-4ebb-a592-c11211d857c6&pd_rd_w=TzX8g&pd_rd_wg=fSfwy&pf_rd_p=78d6a3dc-d4af-46b9-998e-003981a80dbb&pf_rd_r=G7TQDYGSZYJKX4A453HH&psc=1&refRID=G7TQDYGSZYJKX4A453HH][floor mats]] and that's pretty
much it. 

That's it for the setup. 

The easel's always out and I try to keep a prepped canvas either on
the easel or on my rack so setup is a breeze.

1. Put the tablecloth over the table
2. Grab a disposable pallet pad and add paints
3. Fill my brush cleaning bucket with water (since I'm using water
   mixable paints) and pull out the trash can / beater rack

and I'm ready to go. Just takes a minute or two.

Cleanup is also pretty quick: 

1. Throw out the paper pallete
2. Wash the brushes
3. Remove the tablecloth and throw behind the easel. 

Takes about 3 or 4 minutes plus the brush cleaning time. 

So that's my setup. Let me know if I should continue this series when
I'll talk about my experience with water mixable paints, brushes adn
the rest.
