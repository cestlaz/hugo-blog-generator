Hi fellow painters. Okay, I'm not a painter, I'm a Computer Science
teacher in NYC. I thought I'd take up Bob Ross style wet on wet
painting and thought that others might benefit from hearing about
what I've learned so far in my journey.

Since Covid, like many people I've been spending a lot of time at
home and most of my day is facing a computer screen. Work? On
screen. Watching TV or videos? On screen. Even reading a book is more
often than not, on a screen. I had some painting equipment from around
twenty years ago when I went to work as Bob Ross for Halloween but
never really painted. I figured now would be a good time to try it for
real. 

Of course, there were some issues:

- I live in a NYC Apartment so with my family so space is an issue
- So are concerns over fumes and hazardous materials - using, storing,
  and disposing
- Cost is always an issue
- Oh, did I mention, in NYC space is always an issue.


In these pages, I'll talk about what I've used, what's worked for me,
what I've learned and hopefully others can benefit. I'll start with
talking about my setup and how I'm coping with painting in a small
apartment. If people find it useful, I'll follow with the other topics
that are listed as coming soon.
