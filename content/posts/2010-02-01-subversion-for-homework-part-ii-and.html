Starting the new semester tomorrow and I've got a whole bunch of interesting topics to blog about. Some about pedagogy, some technical, and some that I can't really catagorize.<br /><br />For now, though, just a brief follow up on using Subversion for homework collection.<br /><br />The basic model used in New York City for teacher improvement and evaluation is the official "observation." Either your supervisor or the principal sits in on one of your classes. Afterwards you meet and discuss the lesson and a report is written up. Basically, there are two possible outcomes: satisfactory or unsatisfactory.<br /><br />Untenured teachers are generally observed three times a semester. Tenured teachers, once a year.<br /><br />In all cases, this system is severely flawed. The supervisor sees a 40 minute snapshot out of context and is supposed to evaluate the teacher and make recommendations for teacher improvement. It's generally of limited value at best.<br /><br />Because of this, years ago, I started to ask my students to evaluate me. For quite some time now, I've used a custom written web app that allows students to complete long questionnaires over a period of weeks. The system allows me to know who submitted an evaluation while maintaining anonymity. <br /><br />I've found these evaluations to be incredibly valuable and I've used them to try to improve my classes and my teaching over the years.<br /><br />Having just wrapped the semester, I've gone through my students responses and the vast majority liked using subversion for homework. As I figured, some felt that it was a little confusing at first and there was a learning curve but most felt it was either as good as any other method and many said it was superior.<br /> <br />This combined with the fact that it makes me more efficient confirms that it's a win.<br /><br />It was also interesting that I had hardly any suggestions for alternative ways of collecting homework.<br /><br />Recently, I've been using Git for my personal development work and I'm planning on experimenting with it in one of my classes, so we'll see how that goes.<br /><br />Now, on to the new semester!!!!!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-3477377644002525047?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
