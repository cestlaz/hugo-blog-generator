Today was my 50th Birthday. I'm usually pretty low key on birthdays
and today was no different. I got up, exercised, went to work, taught
my class and went back to my office for office hours.

What a great surprise when all of a sudden my students from last year
appeared at my office with a Happy Birthday a card and a cake:

It felt pretty terrific. I wasn't expecting this and was really moved.

We don't make the big bucks but little things like this make me feel
pretty terrific as a teacher.
