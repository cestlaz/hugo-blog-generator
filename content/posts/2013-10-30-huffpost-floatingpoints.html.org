The other week I was invited by <a href="https://twitter.com/brandondiamond">Brandon Diamond</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/IlanaSufrin">Ilana Sufrin</a>  to participate in <a href="https://twitter.com/HuffPostLabs">HuffPost Labs</a> podcast - Floating Points.
<p>
I've known Brandon for a while and he's a really awesome guy. He's a
techie for sure but he also understands the importance of community
building. Brandon and Ilana (also awesome but I haven't known her as
long) are at HuffPost labs and also are working on important
initiatives like <a href="https://twitter.com/HackerUnion">Hacker Union</a>.
<p>
When they asked me to take part, I jumped. Here's the podcast:

Chatting with HuffPost labs team before recording, we were talking
about the Stuy CS family. "Hey - I bet you know our guest from two
podcasts ago." Sure enough, <a href="https://twitter.com/amyquispe">Amy</a> was
on Floating Points just a couple of weeks before. Here's her episode:

Enjoy.
