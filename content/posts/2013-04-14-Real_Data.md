When looking for assignments for our classes, in addition to trying to
craft assignments that develop and reinforce key ideas, we also strive
to come up with ideas that "speak" to the students and keep their
interest. We write small games, use problems within the student's
experiences, and in general try to find problems that are appealing.

This is much easier to do when the kids can read data from a file. The
tool we're using with our sophomores right now is Python and Python
makes reading files very easy. Combining file input with basic string
functions and all of a sudden, we can read and parse comma separated
values.

{{< highlight python>}}
l=[]
for line in open(filename).readlines():
l.append(line.strip().split(",")
{{< / highlight >}}

True, this doesn't handle quotes and embedded commas, but that just
leads to a discussion on cleaning up data and when we do list
comprehensions, things get even slicker.

We could just make up some sample data, for example, student test scores:

Tom,95,87,97,93

Sarah,98,98,84,92

Harry,90,90,90,90

Sue,94,95,96,97

But it's so much more fun with the wealth of CSV data waiting to be
grabbed. If your kids like sports, you can check
out <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/">baseball-reference.com</a>
or it's counterparts for basketball or football.

We decided to look at government data instead.

Federal data can be found at <a href="http://www.data.gov/">data.gov</a> but we focused on <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/">New York City</a>. We
settled
on <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4">SAT</a>
data. SAT math, reading, and writing scores for all NYC public
schools. Something Stuy kids are very interested in. We were able to
look for comparable schools, which schools had large spreads between
math and verbal, which schools had score increases over time, etc.

Much more interesting to look at real SAT data than made up student
grade info.

Tomorrow we'll look at combining data sets -- looking at
the relationship between SAT scores and school ratings and
demographics. It should be interesting. Later, we'll grab books
from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> and see
how we can analyze large texts.

The moral of the story - there's lots of great data easily accessible
-- let's use it to motivate and engage our students.

<b>UPDATE:</b>

It's taken me a while to post this, and in the meantime we analyzed
the SAT data from one NYC data set and matched it with a data set of
demographic data:

<div align="center">
<a href="/img/SAT_SCORES.png" rel="lightbox">
<img width="50%" src="/img/SAT_SCORES.png" class="" alt="" />
</a>
</div>

The graph shows a strong correlation between schools with a high number of
students eligable for free lunch (the Y-axis) and low SAT scores (the
X-axis). This led to a very interesting conversation on the effects of
poverty.

We also noticed a couple of outliers. There's one school at about
(1400,82). High poverty (free lunch) and national average SAT. Also two
schools with low free lunch numbers and middling SAT scores
(1400,17ish).

The (1400,82) point turns out to be a school that caters to English
Language Learners and we presume has a large number of recent
immigrants (partially noted by the name and also by the fact that
their SAT math scores far surpassed the English ones).

Great discussions ensued all due to applying CS to real world data.
