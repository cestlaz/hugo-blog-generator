Today's video talks about using emacs [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode][Tramp]] mode.

Tramp mode allows you to edit remote files using your local emacs. I usually do this over ssh.

To edit a file on a machine **www.cstuy.org** I would first
**find-file** using **C-c C-f** and then for the file name to open:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
/ssh:www.cstuy.org:/home/zamansky/sc/testfile
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

this would open the file **testfile** in the absolute directory
**/home/zamansky/sc**. If my username on the remote machine is
different:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
/ssh:username@www.cstuy.org:/home/zamansky/sc/testfile
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

And I can also work relative to my home directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
/ssh:username@www.cstuy.org:sc/testfile
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

If I just hit enter after the machine name and **:** -


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
/ssh:username@www.cstuy.org:
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

I end up in a dired buffer on the remote machine.

Likewise if I run a **shell** or **eshell** in the tramp buffer, it
will run the shell on the remote machine. In the video I showed how
shell didn't work because locally, I'm configured to use zsh and I
don't have zsh installed remotely. Eshell, however, worked fine.

Using tramp in this way gives us all of the power of our local emacs
configuration to edit a file on a remote machine.

You can also use tramp to edit local files as root using sudo:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
sudo::/tmp/sc/rootfile
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

Note the double colon.

Finally, you can do the double-whammy - remote root editing:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
ssh::www.cstu.org|sudo:www.cstuy.org:/home/zamansky/sc/rootfile
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC
If you use zsh and any of this freezes, just do a search on "zsh
tramp" and the top couple of hits will tell you what to add to your
configuration files to fix things.

Finally, I mentioned in the video that I don't use tramp all that much
anymore. That's mostly because I don't do much remote editing
anymore. I used it more when I was administering a number of machines
at Stuyvesant.

I still use it periodically, but I also use [[https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs][sshfs]], a Linux tool (which
may be available for other operating systems) that allows me to mount
a directory tree from a remote machine and use it on my local machine.
