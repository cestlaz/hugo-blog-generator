I originally planned on do some videos on C++ development but I'm just
not feeling it. Probably because I'm excited to be working with my
new class and we're working in Python. We're not going to be using
C+++ for a few months so I'll get to those videos a little later.

Today, I want to cover what I consider a leatherman or multi-tool for
Emacs. Something that isn't perfect for any particular job but can get
almost any job done: Macros.

In their simplest form, macros let you record and play back
keystrokes.

The video goes over the specifics.

Here are the main functions / keystrokes.

| Command                              | Key |
|--------------------------------------+-----|
| kmacro-start-macro-or-insert-counter | F3  |
| kmacro-end-and-call-macro            | F4  |
| kmacro-name-last-macro               |     |
| insert-kbd-macro                     |     |

This covers most of my use of macros but there's more. You can adjust
or set the counter, edit old macros and there's even a way to have a
macro pause for input in the middle.
