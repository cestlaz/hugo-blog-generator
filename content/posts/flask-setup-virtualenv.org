Those laptops that my Hunter students were supposed to get have
finally arrived. We're distributing them on Monday. Each student will
have a Dell laptop running Ubuntu 16.04 for as long as they're in the
program.

This means we can finally start using the web as a way of displaying
and sharing our projects.

For this type of web development, I'm a big fan of using [[http://flask.pocoo.org][Flask]]. Flask
is a Python microframework. The easiest analogy is saying it's like
Ruby on rails but in Python. That's close enough for our purposes.

I much prefer Python to Ruby as a teaching tool because it leads to
roads going in all sorts of directions so it was merely a matter of
figuring out which framework or platform to use. I found Django to be
far too big, cumbersome, and all encompasing while on the other hand,
[[http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/][Werkzeug]], which Flask is based on is a little too low level.

Flask hit the sweet spot. Easy routing, session and form handling,
templates, pretty much everything I was looking for but very
unopinionated and open ended. Perfect for teaching and learning and
perfect for lightweight projects. The sourecode is also
straightforward enough for a student to explore.

Below is a video going over setting up Linux from right after an
install to use the python virtualenv package. The next video will go
over installing Flask and setting up a simple application. Later, I'll
post a video on deployment to a [[http://digitalocean.com][Digital Ocean]] Droplet.

Here are some notes relating to the video.

First, go to your "software sources" or "software updates"
application from the menu and select all the sources (as described n
the video)

To update a new system:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
{{< highlight "sh" >}}
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgade
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

To install the most recent emacs snapshot
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
{{< highlight "sh" >}}
sudo apt-add repository -y ppa:ubuntu-lisp
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install emacs-snapshot
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

To install python pip (used to install other python packages)
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
{{< highlight "sh" >}}
sudo apt-get install python-pip
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

and then to install the virtualenv packages
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
{{< highlight "sh" >}}
sudo pip install virtualenv
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

To create a python3 virtual environment
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
{{< highlight "sh" >}}
pip install -p python3 venv-folder
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

- You can activate the envorinment (assuming you create the folder under
your home directory):
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
{{< highlight "sh" >}}
source ~/venv-folder/bin/activate
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

And to deactivate it, from the activated terminal
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
{{< highlight "sh" >}}
deactivate
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

Here's the video. Next time, we'll install Flask into an virtual
environment.
