I've been holding off on doing a [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] video for a while. Mostly
because I wasn't using it exclusively and also because there are
already a number of good Magit videos and resources out there.

What changed? Along with the new version of Magin, Jonas Bernoulli
wrote up [[https://emacsair.me/2017/09/01/magit-walk-through/][a walkthrough of the Magit interface]]. For whatever reason,
it all finally clicked.

In spite of what the documentation says, Magit *is not* an interface
for git. Magit is a *command and control* center for git. You can
launch it just to execute some git commands but you can also leave it
up and running in an Emacs window or frame as a constant project
overview.

Wow. Mind blown!!!

If you use Emacs for Deveopment, you *have to* use Magit. If you don't
use Emacs, you can load it on the side for Magit. If you're not a
developer, learn to code so you can use Magit!!!!!

I tried to do justice to the package in the video. Magit along with [[https://orgmode.org/][Org
Mode]] are arguably Emacs killer apps - enough in and of themselves to
justify using Emacs.

Check out the video:
