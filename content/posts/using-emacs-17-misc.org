I'm working on getting enough of my real configuration into this
series so that I can dump my current one and use this one all them
time and grow it back up an episode at a time.

I think we're almost there.

This time, we're looking at a few small packages that I use all the
time.

** Highlight line Mode

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-listp
{{< highlight "emacs-listp" >}}
(global-hl-line-mode t)
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

this turns on highlight line mode.  It makes it easy to see the line
the cursor's on. Nothing huge, I just like it.

** [[https://github.com/Malabarba/beacon][Beacon mode]]

[[https://github.com/Malabarba/beacon][Beacon mode]] flashes the cursor whenever you scroll. It makes things
easy to locate the cursor when scrolling

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
; flashes the cursor's line when you scroll
(use-package beacon
:ensure t
:config
(beacon-mode 1)
; this color looks good for the zenburn theme but not for the one
; I'm using for the videos
; (setq beacon-color "#666600")
)
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC


** [[https://github.com/nflath/hungry-delete][Hungry Delete mode]]

[[https://github.com/nflath/hungry-delete][This mode]] deletes all the whitespace after the cursor (or before it)
when you use delete or backspace.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
; deletes all the whitespace when you hit backspace or delete
(use-package hungry-delete
:ensure t
:config
(global-hungry-delete-mode))
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

** [[https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el][Expand Region]]

[[https://github.com/magnars][Magnar Sveen's]] awesome expand region mode is a must have. He also
wrote the amazing [[https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el][multiple cursors]] package. I highly recommend
checking out his work.

Expand region expands the marked region by semantic units. It's my go
to way of marking text for manipulation

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
; expand the marked region in semantic increments (negative prefix to reduce region)
(use-package expand-region
:ensure t
:config
(global-set-key (kbd "C-=") 'er/expand-region))

{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC


I also tried to look at aggressive indent but that had some problems
so we'll come back to that later.
