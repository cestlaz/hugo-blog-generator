<a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2016/01/15/shift-image.html#.Vpvy4x8SrmE">Last time</a> we took a look at implementing a Cellular Automaton in
NetLogo to do some simple image manipulation. We just scratched the
surface. In class, the kids write pretty nice Photoshop Light
applications.
</p>

<p>
Today we'll look at some more ambitious problem solving - using a
Cellular Automaton to find a path through a maze.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline2">Part 1 - finding possible paths</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline2">
<p>
We'll use the image above as an example and a live model with all the
code is at the end of this post.
</p>

<p>
Each square of the maze is a
NetLogo patch. White square represent possible paths, Red is our
entrance, green our exit. As we explore the maze, we'll color the
cells yellow.
</p>

<p>
Remember, in  a Cellular Automaton (CA), each cell makes a decision as to
it's next state based on information about its neighbors (up, down,
left, and right only in this case).
</p>

<p>
So, if every cell is looking around at it's neighbors, most cells
don't have enough information. The only white cell that might be on
the path from entrance to exit is the one next to the entrance - it
might be on the path.
</p>

<p>
This leads us to the first step of our CA rule set:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-netlogo">; if I have a green neighbor, I might be on the path, turn yellow
ask patches with [pcolor = white] [
if any? neighbors with [pcolor = red] [
set pcolor yellow
]
]
</pre>
</div>

</p>

<a href="#" data-featherlight="/img/maze-ca/maze-1.png">
<img class="smaller" src="/img/maze-ca/maze-1.png">
</a>

<p>
Next time through, we notice that a cell might be on the path if it's
white and it has either red or yellow neighbors.
</p>


<a href="#" data-featherlight="/img/maze-ca/maze-2.png">
<img class="smaller" src="/img/maze-ca/maze-2.png">

<a href="#" data-featherlight="/img/maze-ca/maze-3.png">
<img class="smaller" src="/img/maze-ca/maze-3.png">
</a>

<a href="#" data-featherlight="/img/maze-ca/maze-4.png">
<img class="smaller" src="/img/maze-ca/maze-4.png">
</a>

<p>
Eventually, we end up with a yellow abutting green - the exit.
</p>

<a href="#" data-featherlight="/img/maze-ca/maze-found.png">
<img class="smaller" src="/img/maze-ca/maze-found.png">
</a>

<p>
Notice that each yellow cell is also numbered. The number indicates
how many steps it took to get there from the entrance. The
implementation is trivial:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Start by giving each patch a variable <b><b>step</b></b> and starting it at 0.</li>
<li>When a cell is about to turn yellow, it should look at it's yellow
or red neighbors, ask for their <b><b>step</b></b> value (they'll all be the
same - think about why), and set it's <b><b>step</b></b> value to one more
than that.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We'll use these step numbers to recover the actual shortest path.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline3">Part 2 - recovering the shortest path.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline3">
<p>
We can now use the yellow patches with the step numbers to find our
way back.
</p>

<p>
We're going to build a solution set.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>start with an empty solution set.</li>
<li>take the only green cell not in the solution set (let's call it <b><b>G</b></b>).</li>
<li>Ask <b><b>G</b></b>'s yellow neighbor with lowest step number to turn
itself green (that cell will be <b><b>G</b></b> next time around).</li>
<li>Place <b><b>G</b></b> into the solution set (leaving the new green cell as
the only green cell not in the solution set).</li>
<li>Repeat 2 - 5 until we're back at the entrance.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This is one of my favorite intro topics. It's using a CA - something
normally just presented as a toy idea, to solve a real problem. It
reinforces parallel processing and foreshadows all sorts of pathfinding
ideas to come.
</p>

<p>
Below is the complete NetLogo program. You can look at the code by
clicking on the code tab at the bottom.
</p>

<p>
To run:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b><b>setup</b></b> sets up all the variables and clears the world.</li>
<li><b><b>buildmaze</b></b> builds a random maze.</li>
<li><b><b>solve</b></b> is a toggle to run through an entire solution.</li>
<li><b><b>step</b></b> single steps through the CA.</li>
<li><b><b>reset</b></b> Resets all the variables and recolors the maze to
unsolved.</li>
<li>The other buttons are toggles for drawing your own maze.</li>
</ul>
