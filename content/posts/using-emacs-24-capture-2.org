Not much in today's actual post. The video is a continuation of the last one on [[http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-23-capture-1][org-capture]].

The video goes over how I set things up to pop up a new frame to do a
capture even if emacs isn't on screen (as long as it's running) by
hitting **F1**. I would  have preferred to bind to **C-c c** - the
same as within emacs but I havn't figured out how to do that in Ubuntu
or Mint Linux yet.

Here's the elisp code for the configuration file to do the heavy
lifting. I can't for th elife of me remember who's blog I found it
on. If anyone knows, please leave a comment - I'd like to give credit
where credit's due:


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}

(defadvice org-capture-finalize
(after delete-capture-frame activate)
"Advise capture-finalize to close the frame"
(if (equal "capture" (frame-parameter nil 'name))
(delete-frame)))

(defadvice org-capture-destroy
(after delete-capture-frame activate)
"Advise capture-destroy to close the frame"
(if (equal "capture" (frame-parameter nil 'name))
(delete-frame)))

(use-package noflet
:ensure t )
(defun make-capture-frame ()
"Create a new frame and run org-capture."
(interactive)
(make-frame '((name . "capture")))
(select-frame-by-name "capture")
(delete-other-windows)
(noflet ((switch-to-buffer-other-window (buf) (switch-to-buffer buf)))
(org-capture)))

{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

The command I bind to the keyboard shortcut in my window manager:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
{{< highlight "bash" >}}
emacsclient -ne "(make-capture-frame)"
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

There will be a third capture video in a few weeks where I'll talk
about scheduling and agendas. Right now, I'm playing with org-gcal to
sync with my Google calendar and want to figure out a config I'm happy
with before making that video.
