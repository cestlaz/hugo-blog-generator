This past year I recorded 14 Using Emacs videos. This is on top of the
25 videos I made last year. The fall off in production is
understandable. I got through my day to day configuration in the
late 20s and since then the videos have just been on things I've
rediscovered, things that became useful and things that I just found
interesting. It was also a busier year.

Why did I start the series? Mostly for my students. There's the built
in Emacs tutorial and other beginner resources but how do you go from
the basics to a real working configuration? For years I would show my
kids Emacs and use it in class but there was never a path for them to
follow from beginner to craftsman. I hoped the videos would fill the
void.

It probably didn't. I don't think I'm getting greater Emacs adoption
from my students but on the other hand, I've found making the series
rewarding for other reasons.

First and foremost, it's allowed me to be an active contributing
member of the Emacs community. I haven't written any Emacs packages
nor am I an active guy on any Emacs forums but this is a way I can do
my part.

Second, although there hasn't been a great deal of comments on the
videos or blog posts I've gotten to know a few people that I wouldn't
have gotten to know otherwise.

It also shows that that if you put things out there people might find
it useful. I don't know how many people saw my Emacs posts at the
start but a year and half later I've got 1,700 YouTube
subscribers. Sure, that's nothing compared to many YouTubers but
for a guy making schlocky videos at his desk about an as much as I hate to admit it
non-maintream editor, I think it's pretty cool.

The question is what to make videos on moving forward?

I thought I'd throw it out to the community. Here's an embedded
poll. Feel free to suggest other topics either on the blog or
as a Twitter reply.

I can't promise I'll get to all or any but I'll certainly check out
the popular suggestions.
