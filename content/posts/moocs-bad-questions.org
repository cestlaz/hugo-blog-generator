Most mornings, I start my day with a workout. Sometimes I run,
sometimes I use my bike trainer. Dealing with plantar
fasciitis since last June, it's mostly been the bike.

I occupy the time by either watching YouTube videos or catching up on
[[https://cacm.acm.org/][Communications of the ACM]] or [[https://www.americanscientist.org/][American Scientist]]. I'm about 6 months
behind on both.

Inspired by some talk in one of the CS Ed Facebook groups, I thought
I'd use the time to start going through some MOOCs. I started with
Udacity's Intro to Information Security.

I'm only in lesson 4 but it's pretty light weight and generally well
presented but I keep seeing the same thing that pisses me off about
moocs. At the end of the day the video is just a lecture and what's
worse, a lecture with no feedback loop.

Don't get me wrong, I love the fact that Udacity and the others have
their material up online and that I can get to it free of charge but I
don't love the fact there are people that still believe putting a computer
in front of a kid is better than a teacher.

I think this quiz question is pretty representative of what I'm
talking about.

#+CAPTION[something]: Typically bad mooc question

It's just a silly inline quiz question and not a particularly
important one but it pisses me off.

To start with, it uses the word  **could**  not **did**. That means
that every answer is correct. In fact an asnwer  choice like
"we're more secure because we have this really good engineer named
Stanley" could be given and would be a correct answer since  the
vendor **could** base their claim on Stanley's awesomness, it would
just be a bad idea. Unless you remember the specific ad campaign, you won't
know the answer  and even if you did, internally, they could use any
justification they want.

It reminds me of when my brother was in grade school and he had a test
question of:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Can you name all 50 states in the United States of America?
#+END_QUOTE

My brother's answer was "no." He was correct. I don't remember if the
teacher agreed.

To be fair, I'm just watching the videos and it's possible that the
readings clarified the question but even so, this is a very bad
question.

Yes, it's just a silly quiz but it is indicative of the problem with
any online learning resource and I and I'm sure others find it
frustrating.

I don't want to come down hard on the lecturer or whomever made the
quiz question. In a class I might ask a question poorly but I have an
immediate feedback loop and can fix things right then and
there. Frustration doesn't build and in the case of holes in  important
conceptual material deficiencies don't develop.

I also don't want to come down on free resources that I use and
benefit from.

These types of issues seem small and the autodidacts that succeed in
using MOOCS work around them but if you look at these materials
critically as a teacher it's plain to see that their no substitute for
the real thing.
