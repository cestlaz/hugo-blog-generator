I've taken part in a few conversations and read more than a few
threads on teacher certification exams recently. Specifically, CS
teacher certification exams. There are a bunch of them floating
around. There's the [[https://www.ets.org/praxis/prepare/materials/5651%0A][Praxis]] offered by ETS, the one from the [[https://www.nestest.com/TestView.aspx?f=HTML_FRAG/NT315_PrepMaterials.html%0A][National
Evaluation Series]],  the [[https://www.west.nesinc.com/TestView.aspx?f=HTML_FRAG/WA073_PrepMaterials.html][Washington Evaluator Test Series]] one and then
there's what's [[https://www.weteachcs.org/][going on in Texas]]. NY State says it will eventually
develop their own.

I have mixed feelings about exams like these. From what I've seen some
of the content seems fine and the "stuff you have to know for the
test" isn't necessarily the worst in the world. As a one time
gatekeeper, I'm not necessarily happy with them but they can provide a
test for a basic threshold of knowledge with out too much focus on
test prep.

Of course, they're just the tip of the iceberg, many states including
New York make their teacher candidates also take other exams. In NY
candidates must take the [[https://dianeravitch.net/2013/06/03/what-is-edtpa-and-why-do-critics-dislike-it/][edTPA]] which is expensive for the teacher
candidate but a big money maker for Pearsons.

All of this came out of NCLB back in the day which also created
requirements like "must complete an approved program" as opposed to
just accruing a bunch of relevant education and content credits which
in turn led to more courses like [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/math-for-math-teachers/][Math for Math Teachers]].

For you youngsters out there (which I guess is most of you), I thought
I'd share what it was like back in the day.

Back then, New York City certified it's own teachers as opposed
to now when everything's done directly through the state. The system
was, in my opinion far superior.

I came in as a career changer - I was doing computer work at the
time - and I came in as a math teacher since there was no CS. Since
math was an area of need it was a little easier for me to get my foot
in the door than it would have been for say an English teacher.

To start I went down to the Board of Education in Brooklyn armed with
my college transcript and waited in line. I then met with someone who
evaluated my transcript. Normally, to get started, I would have needed
a certain number of education credits and a certain number of content
(math) credits. I think the magic number was 24 for the content. Since
math was an area of needed you could get started with a TPD license
(Temporary Per Diem) which required no education credits going in. You
had to get 18 graduate education credits within the first, I think two
years and take the National Teacher Exam. You also got one period off
to be mentored which was a pretty sweet deal. Of course it wouldn't be
that simple. I only had 16 math credits so fell short but the
evaluator decided to give me credit for a couple of my more mathy CS
classes like Algorithms to get me over the hump.

I then went to another line to get a brief mini physical and at some
point I was fingerprinted and I had my TPD. The BOE then ran a one
week "learn to teach" bootcamp and I was left to find my own job which
I was fortunately able to do.

So, I had my foot in the door but as a TPD I had no job protections. I
was observed at least 6 times a year and could be fired at will. In
fact, TPD's were annually given pink slips in the spring and had to be
rehired again in the Fall if their schools wanted them.

I got my 18 education credits over the next two years and took the NTE
which was both the easiest and hardest exam I ever had to
take. Easiest content wise but hard because it was a FULL DAY of non
stop writing and my hand was cramped up into a club by days end. That
got me to the next level - the PPT - Preparatory Provisional License,
I think.  This allowed me to be appointed. Once appointed you had job
retention and seniority rights. Not tenure, but a step closer and you
did get some legit job protections. If you started the process with
education credits to go along with content credits you could have
started directly with the PPT.

The final step to get that appointment with the PPT is that you had to
go for an interview with the *Board of Examiners*. This was the good
part. After work one day I went down to Brooklyn Tech, waited my turn
and then was ushered into a classroom. A typical panel would have a
principal, an assistant principal in your subject area, and a couple
of teachers, again in your subject area. They could grill you on
anything they wanted.

They could ask you general teaching questions (usually cached in a scenario):
- how do yo u handle a mixed level class,
- how do you handle a disruptive student

Preparation questions:
- how would you motivate a  class on the Pythagorean Theorem?
- How would you turn a lesson on solving quadratics in to a hands on
lab experience?

or content questions:
- solve this calculus problem...
- Derive this theorem...

I don't remember how long the session lasted but afterwards I left and
a couple of weeks later, I had my PPT and was appointed.

There were a couple of last steps - tenure, which pretty much just
happened since my AP and Principal were both happy with my performance
and I had to get my Masters. Back then you could get a Masters in
anything so I decided to get it in CS rather than Education.


There was a lot to like about the old system. I've never been a big
fan of a lot of the education credits one has to get and while I still
needed a number of them, I'm glad I had the option to take mostly
content credits. I also like what amounted to being evaluated face to
face by an individual rather than an amorphous bureaucracy. I also
loved the mentoring I got but while the system gave me the class
relief time to allow it to happen I think much of the value was due to
my colleagues at Seward Park High School without whom I would have
washed out.

The biggest thing I liked was the Board of Examiners. I found it
somewhat stressful since I was never a math guy but the idea that
you've got to prove yourself to a bunch of local city educators was
HUGE. You weren't expected to give the "correct for the test" answer,
you had to convince people that you might have to work for or with
that you got the goods.

I'm sure we'll never go back to the old days but I thought the current
generation might be interested in hearing what it was like back in the
day.
