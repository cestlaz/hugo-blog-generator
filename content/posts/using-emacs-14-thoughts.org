Sorry for the incosistancy of the posts. I hope to get to that one
video a week soon but I've still got a hectic couple of weeks ahead.

No new material this week, or at least very little. This week, I talk
about some thoughts on the "Using Emacs" series.

In the video I talk about Sacha Chua and her work as a leader in the
Emacs community. Check out her stuff here: [[http://sachachua.com/blog/]]

Here's the video - I hope you enjoy it.

As always, please leave feedback here or on the video.
