Today's video is a bit of a follow up on the last one as well as a few
miscillaneous configuration.

We got some comments on alternate ways to load a file if it exists -
it's always cool to see how different people end up doing similar things.

We then talk about three little configurations. Two I found out about
reading Jon Sander's (jcs) blog [[http://irreal.org/blog][Irreal]]. Jon's blog is a terrific
source of emacs info - if you don't subscribe, you should.

I go over using counsel for working with the kill-ring. The command
counsel-yank-pop acts as a replamcement for yank-pop and it lets you
easily yank anything from the kill ring - not just the most previously
killed/whacked piece.

You just hit **M-y** and then either keep hitting it or use up and
down to select what you want to yank.

Here's the original post from Irreal: [[http://irreal.org/blog/?p=5707]].

I then briefly talk about smoothing things over between the system
clipboard and the kill ring, also from Irreal:
[[http://irreal.org/blog/?p=5702]].

Finally, I talk about auto-revert-mode - this monitors files on your
file system and when they change, they reload your buffer. I find this
very useful to keep multiple machines in sync when I'm working with
files in a could based filesystem like Dropbox or Owncloud.
