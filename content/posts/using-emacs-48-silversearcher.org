A couple of days ago I wrote about on my [[http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/unit-tests-grading-workflow][lab grading workflow]]. In the
post I mentioned that I used Emacs to easily navigate between student
folders and files so I can actually look at their work in addition to
their programs output and test results.

The key is a combination of ~dired~ and [[https://github.com/Wilfred/ag.el][ag]], Emacs's interface to [[https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher][the
Silver Searcher]] which is something like a recursive code grep on
steroids. I also briefly try to show [[https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep][wgrep]] in the video which allows
you to edit Emacs grep buffers, effectively allowing you to make
changes across a set of files all at once. It ended up not working
with silversearcher - if anyone out there knows why, please chime in.

Enjoy:
