Many people think of Emacs as an editor. I like to think of it as an Elisp interpreter where you live code documents.

In some ways, it's like those new fangled interactive programming environments where you type in code and the updates are reflected instantly.

In this video, I try to explain the way I think about Emacs and why it's so cool.

The only change we made to our configuration was adding:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle n
{{< highlight "python" >}}
(tool-bar-mode -1)
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

Which gets rid of the tool bar at the top.

Next time, we start talking about efficiently using Emacs.
