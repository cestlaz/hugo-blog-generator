Very little new Emacs in today's episode of Using Emacs. The video
shows my old blogging workflow and what I'm playing with now.

The only new Emacs covered is the [[https://github.com/rejeep/prodigy.el][prodigy]] package which lets you run
services under Emacs. I use it to run [[https://getnikola.com/blog/index.html][Nikola]]'s development server but
I think prodigy will also be useful when I start writing that knitting
application I promised my wife.

When I started this blog, I used Jekyll. It was simple and worked with
GitHub pages. I wrote about why I transitioned to Nikola [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-04-14-i-hate-ruby/][here]] and
[[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-04-17-emacs-jekyll-nikola/][here]].

There's not much more to say here so enjoy the video:
