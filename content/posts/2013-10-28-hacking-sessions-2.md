Saturday was the second day of CSTUY's Hacking Sessions. We started out
wit a minor panic - none of the laptops could connect to the
wireless!!! After a brief scramble, we finally gave up and gave our
host a call (sorry Davin) and the problem was swiftly addressed. From
there it was off to the races.

Last week we spent most of the session with mixers and setting up the
laptops. Not today. Sam started us off with a brief survey of Python -
some of the Hackers had never seen it before.

From there we divided up the hackers - making sure to spread out the
Pythonistas and they were off on a project. We did a little pig-latin
converter. It's a fun project to start a class with since it can be
attacked in a few different ways and you can illustrate a lot of
interesting coding techniques. For instance, checking for vowels or
consenants can be done with conditionals but testing set membership: **if letter in "aeiou": ** is a touch more elegant.

It was really nice to watch things develop. At first groups were four
individual hackers working on four laptops. Soon, with the
encouragement of our awesome TAs, it was two groups of two talking to
each other and then finally, groups of four all working together.

22 students from 9 schools all hacking together - that's what we're
trying to build. I think we're off to a great start.

We finished the day sharing the projects and learning a little bit
about the Flask microframework for Python.
