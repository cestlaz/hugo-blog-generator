The Hudson Valley's a beautiful place, particularly during the Fall.
We don't get up there as much as we should - usually just for apple
picking and then for <a href="http://sheepandwool.com/">the New York Sheep and Wool Festival</a>.
</p>

<p>
It's a region with great food, hiking, natural beauty, history and more.
</p>

<p>
So, what exactly is growing?
</p>

<p>
The Hudson Valley Tech community.
</p>

<p>
I first heard about what Hudson Valley was doing around Tech back at the August
<a href="http://nytm.tumblr.com/post/125527139762/august-2015-nytm-lineup">New York Tech Meetup</a>. I was there with my students showing off their work.
</p>

<p>
That's where I met <a href="https://twitter.com/kalekaposhilin?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Kale Kaposhilin</a> - one of the organizers of the
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/hvtech/">Hudson Valley Tech Meetup</a>.  I later reconnected with a former student
<a href="https://twitter.com/aq?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Aaron Quint</a> who is also very involved in Tech in Ulster County.
</p>

<p>
Kale, Aaron, and others hosted an amazing event last week. Something
of a coming out party for tech in the Hudson Valley - <a href="http://catskillsconf.com/">CatskillsConf</a>.
</p>

<p>
Catskills Conf was a tech conference but it's not your regular tech
conference. Sure, it had tech speakers like John Resig and <a href="https://twitter.com/dens?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Dennis
Crowley</a>. I brought up some students to show off their work and I gave
a short rant on CS education. Sounds techie enough.
</p>

<p>
But Catskillsconf was special. Hosted at the <a href="http://ashokancenter.org/">Ashokan Center</a>, an
educational retreat, we all stayed bunkhouses together, ate together,
and pretty much felt like we were in summer camp - and I mean that in
the best way.
</p>

<p>
Since we were all on site, nobody left in the evenings. We had live
music, square dancing (what better way to get a group of A-social
techies to mix), a live bird of prey show and <a href="https://twitter.com/songadaymann?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Jonathan Mann</a>, our very
own songwriter recapping each day:

<p>
Then we had the workshops. Sure we had tech - wearables and drones,
but personally, I had more fun at the blacksmithing and ukulele
sessions.
</p>

<p>
I think the biggest thing of all was that it felt like a community was
building. It wasn't like your usual conference where you might know a
few people and then force yourself to meet a few more. I'm looking for
a better word, but for lack of one, it was comfortable.
</p>

<p>
Hats off to Kale, Aaron, and the team for setting the stage and thanks
to everyone there - organizers, participants, staff, and volunteers we all made it an unbelievable experience.
</p>

<p>
Can't wait until next year.
