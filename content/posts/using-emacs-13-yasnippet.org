It turns out that [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy][Elpy]], a popular emacs package for python development
is much easier to set up than I remember. It turns out all you need
is:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
(use-package elpy
:ensure t
:config
(elpy-enable))
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

The video shows how to install and a bit of use. I don't think it's a
package I'm going to use much since I use other tools to do similar
things but it's worth checking out.

The main event this week is [[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][yasnippet]], a package that lets you expand
text aliases. Let's say you want to put the fairly standard:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
{{< highlight "python" >}}
if __name__ == '__main__':
main()
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

in my file. I can just type **ifm** and then hit the **TAB** key and
it would expand to the above code. Yasnippet also lets you leave
placeholders for variables, function names and more. It's a pretty
neat package.

I use it for boilerplate code. The example in the video shows how I
set up a snippet for the boilerplate code used when creating an
application with the **Flask** python microframework.

Setting up yasnippet is as easy as:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
(use-package yasnippet
:ensure t
:init
(yas-global-mode 1))
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

and it has built in support for [[https://github.com/AndreaCrotti/yasnippet-snippets/tree/9ce0b05f4b4d693831e67dd65d660716a8192e8d][tons of langauges]]. You can also easily
create your own snippets. See the documentation for details on the
file format. Just create a text file for the snippet and place it in a
subidectory under the snippets subdirectory of .emacs.d. The name of
the subdirectory should be the name of the emacs mode for which the
snippet is defined. I put up the snippet I use for flask so feel free
to check that out.
