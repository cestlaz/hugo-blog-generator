It's been pointed out by a couple of bloggers I follow:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://gasstationwithoutpumps.wordpress.com/">Gas station without pumps</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/">Computer Science Teacher (Alfred Thompson's blog)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
That it's International Blog Delurking Week.
</p>

<p>
So, I know I don't have a large readership, but if you do read this
blog, why not give a brief hi in the comments.  I'd love to know who you are and what you do.
