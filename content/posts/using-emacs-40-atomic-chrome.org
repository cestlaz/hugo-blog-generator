Thanks to everyone who voted for topics or commented with suggestions
for videos. I'll try to get to them in the coming months.

Today is just a quick hit on Atomic Chrome - an Emacs package and
browser extension that allows you to edit web form inputs with Emacs.

* UPDATE

I forgot to mention that you can set a shortcut key, at least in chrome rather than
clicking on the icon. This makes things much smoother.

All you have to do is:

1. Go to **chrome://extensions**
2. On the bottom of the page you'll see a button to set **keyboard shortcuts**
3. Set the shortcut for Atomic Chrome

Enjoy:
