We're now at the end of my first semester at Hunter. The Spring term
classes don't start until the end of January. I've got an assortment
of projects to work on but some of the students should have a nice
block of relatively free time.

I  wanted to share some recommendations on things to explore with a
few student groups and thought it would be easier to write those
recommendations down here once and then just share a link.

So, here we go.

Much of the first few CS classes at Hunter and elsewhere focus on the
fundamentals of programming, data structures, and algorithms. It's all
good stuff but students want to supplement that classroom knowledge
with some practical skills.

I recommend playing with a language like Python that can be used in
all sorts of domains. If you haven't played with it, check it out.

I like [[https://automatetheboringstuff.com/][Automate the Boring Stuff with Python]] as a nice, free, online
text.

I'd also recommend learning a web platform like [[http://flask.pocoo.org][Flask.]] Flask is a web
framework in Python. The web site has a nice getting started guide and
tutorial but here are a couple of other great learning Flask
resources:
- [[https://github.com/realpython/discover-flask][Discover Flask]]
- [[https://exploreflask.com/en/latest/][Explore Flask]]

Once armed with the above, you'll be well positioned to work on a
variety of your own projects, enter hackathons, and more.

I'm also a big believer in using good tools. I love the emacs text
editor. Why not spend some time going through the web series on [[http://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs][Using
Emacs]].

Finally, if you're not using Git, you should be. Here are a couple of
playlists to get you started:

- [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq0VzNtDZbe9QLq8YCizFN2TVWvlLjrvX][https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq0VzNtDZbe9QLq8YCizFN2TVWvlLjrvX]]
- [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoGsJC6ZzSwm959Do9ZgZM9U-xp27NEaQ][https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoGsJC6ZzSwm959Do9ZgZM9U-xp27NEaQ]]

And if you haven't done so already, head over to [[https://education.github.com/pack][Github Education]] and
sign up for a student developer pack.

So, there are a few recommendations on things to work on before the
next term begins.

Enjoy
