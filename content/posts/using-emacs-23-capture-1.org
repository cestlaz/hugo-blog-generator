Org mode has an amazing feature - **org-capture**. I only started
using it recently but it's really awesome.

What took me so long?

Probably that the manual seemed a little intimidating.

It really isn't hard, though. Combined with what I'll go over in the
next video and post (and a future one for Google calendar sync) it's
what I use for:

- recording blog ideas
- managing bookmarks
- taking short Notes
- managing my calendar.

I use the binding:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c c")
'org-capture)
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

By default, running org-capture brings up a form to capture a "task"
but things get really cool when you start making your own capture
templates. With capture templates, you can speed up recording
information and then tell org-mode to store it where you want it.

Here are my template settings.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
(setq org-capture-templates
'(("a" "Appointment" entry (file  "~/Dropbox/orgfiles/gcal.org" "Appointments")
"* TODO %?\n:PROPERTIES:\n\n:END:\nDEADLINE: %^T \n %i\n")
("n" "Note" entry (file+headline "~/Dropbox/orgfiles/notes.org" "Notes")
"* Note %?\n%T")
("l" "Link" entry (file+headline "~/Dropbox/orgfiles/links.org" "Links")
"* %? %^L %^g \n%T" :prepend t)
("b" "Blog idea" entry (file+headline "~/Dropbox/orgfiles/i.org" "Blog Topics:")
"* %?\n%T" :prepend t)
("t" "To Do Item" entry (file+headline "~/Dropbox/orgfiles/i.org" "To Do Items")
"* %?\n%T" :prepend t)
("j" "Journal" entry (file+datetree "~/Dropbox/journal.org")
"* %?\nEntered on %U\n  %i\n  %a")
("s" "Screencast" entry (file "~/Dropbox/orgfiles/screencastnotes.org")
"* %?\n%i\n")))

{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

Let's look at the **Blog** entry:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
("b" "Blog idea" entry (file+headline "~/Dropbox/orgfiles/i.org" "Blog Topics:")
"* %?\n%T" :prepend t)
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC
It's a list with a bunch of options. The first string **b** is the
key to type to select this template, **Blog idea** is the actual name
for this template.

The next item, **entry** describes the type of template you're
creating. **entry** says you're going to create an org node with a
headline which can then be added to an org-file. You can also have
your template create things like an org list **item** a checkbox
**checkitem** or even **plain** text. You can see the full set of
options [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Template-elements.html#Template-elements][here]].

Next, in parentheses, you have the target - where to store the captured
info. The **Blog idea** template says **file+headline** followed by a
filename in quotes and a headline in quotes. This says to store the
new org heading you're capturing in the file
"~/Dropbox/orgfiles/i.org" under the heading "Blog Topics:" Contrast
this to the **appointments** template which just specifies **file**
and a filename. The **appointments** template will just append the new
appointment to its specified file whereas **Blog idea** will prepend
(due to the **:prepend** option at the end of the template) to the
"Blog Topics:" heading in **i.org**.

After this we have the actual template: "* %?\n%T" - the %? and %T are
placeholders for substitutions. The **%T** prompts for a date with a
timestamp and the **%?** is where to leave the cursor for final input
before saving the capture.

Finally, **:prepend** and other options can be found at the above link.

All the substitutions can be found in [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Template-expansion.html#Template-expansion][the docs]].

Once you've set up your templates, it's quick and easy to capture
information.

This video shows the basics. The next one shows how to pop up a
capture even when you're not in emacs and how I use org-capture to
maintain my web bookmarks.

More information on capture templates can be found [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Capture-templates.html][here]].
