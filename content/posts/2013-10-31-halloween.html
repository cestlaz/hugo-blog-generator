Today was Halloween. This year we were the crew of the Enterprise. The original series, that is.

Overall, the school had a much more subdued spirit than past years but
it was fun. Certainly more fun for me than the past couple of years.

For those of you that don't know - I have a long history of going all
out for Halloween. Starting in October 1994 as Groo the Wanderer:

To many more. I've been Little Ceaser, Hulk Hogan, Duffman, The Hulk,
Fred Flintstone, The Jolly Green Giant, Homer Simpson and more.

Some of my favorites were caught on video. Here's a playlist with a bunch of them:

I really enjoy costumes like this one because it's all about schtick
-- interaction with others in the school.

When it first started, I wasn't sure how the whole costume thing would
go over. Now, 20 years later, it's expected. Every year I've got to do
something good and something different. That's OK though, because it
has a great affect on the classes. True, most students know me before they enter my class due to reputation, good or bad, but after Halloween there's a noticable change in the class. All of a sudden I'm just a little less scary.

Looking forward to next year.
