<p>
SoftDev students are hard at work on their final projects. By now,
they all have fairly complex code bases. This limits how much I can
help them with debugging.
</p>

<p>
There are some problems, though, that they have to contend with that
even with experience, are hard to spot. Notably because the very
tools you use to debug these errors are part of the problem.
</p>

<p>
Last week, this happened twice. Both cases were brought to me by
really strong students which just goes to underscore how insidious
these problems can be.
</p>


<p>
Here's a fake code snippet of a <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> application that illustrates
both problems.
</p>


<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span class="linenr"> 1: </span>from flask import Flask, render_template
<span class="linenr"> 2: </span>
<span class="linenr"> 3: </span>app = Flask(__name__)
<span class="linenr"> 4: </span>
<span class="linenr"> 5: </span>@app.route("/")
<span class="linenr"> 6: </span>def index():
<span class="linenr"> 7: </span>    return "hello"
<span class="linenr"> 8: </span>
<span class="linenr"> 9: </span>@app.route('/test/&lt;some_data&gt;')
<span class="linenr">10: </span>def test():
<span class="linenr">11: </span>    picture_url = build_url(some_data)
<span class="linenr">12: </span>    result = api_test(picture_url)
<span class="linenr">13: </span>    do_something(result)
<span class="linenr">14: </span>
<span class="linenr">15: </span>if __name__ == "__main__":
<span class="linenr">16: </span>   app.debug = True
<span class="linenr">17: </span>   app.secret_key = "some secret key"
<span class="linenr">18: </span>   app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
</pre>
</div>


<p>
First, the "easy" one. The student was trying to deploy the
application. We use <a href="http://gunicorn.org/">Green Unicorn</a> to deploy our applications,
ultimately on <a href="http://digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> servers in the cloud.
</p>

<p>
The student was using the correct command:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-shell">gunicorn -W 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
</pre>
</div>

<p>
but it wasn't working. It ran, but whenever he went to the site, it
came back with an error.
</p>

<p>
The problem?
</p>

<p>
He had to change:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">if __name__ == "__main__":
app.debug = True
app.secret_key = "some secret key"
app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
to
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">app.secret_key = "some secret key"
if __name__ == "__main__":
app.debug = True
app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Normally, when developing and testing our applications, we use the
test server that's bundled with Flask. The line that reads
"app.run&#x2026;" takes care of this.
</p>

<p>
When running the application as a "main program" - "python app.py" the
if statement is true and it runs the indented lines, setting the
secret key which is required for session management.
</p>

<p>
When running under <b><b>gunicorn</b></b>, the <b><b>gunicorn</b></b> server loads the
application as a module and then runs it. In this case name isn't main
so it never sets secret key and so we have a problem.
</p>

<p>
Pretty subtle and even though we did cover this in class, it comes up
pretty rarely so it's not an easy catch.
</p>

<p>
Then there was this problem.
</p>

<p>
The setup for this one's a little more complicated. The group was
using a facial recognition api. You provide the API with the url to an
image, it fetches it and does recognition.
</p>

<p>
It's also important to note that when Flask is running, it will serve
files from a static directory, so, if I'm running my flask server on
myhost, port 800 and you stored an image named picture.jpg in the
static directory, going to:
</p>

<verbatim>
http://myhost:8000/static/picture.jpg
</verbatim>
<br><br>


<p>
would get that image.
</p>

<p>
The group did things right. They ran the Flask test server to serve
the static files and then wrote a small python program to test the
api:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">picture_url = build_url(some_data)
result = api_test(picture_url)
do_something(result)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Everything worked fine.
</p>

<p>
But, when they put this code in as a route in their web app (as in the
top code fragment), it froze.
</p>

<p>
They couldn't figure it out.
</p>

<p>
The code worked as a "stand alone" but not in the web app.
</p>

<p>
The problem?
</p>

<p>
Once again, the built in Flask development server.
</p>

<p>
The development server runs in a single thread / process. This means
it can only do one thing at a time. When they ran their test as a
separate program, the api they used made a request to their app to
serve up the static picture file and it worked.
</p>

<p>
When they ran from the Flask application itself, their app made a call
to the web api (line 12) and then blocked while waiting for the
response. The web api tried to request the image from the Flask app
but it was blocked &#x2013; <b><b>deadlock</b></b>.
</p>

<p>
Again, the solution was to run the web app using a server that could
handle multiple requests - gunicorn.
</p>

<p>
Once again, that solved the problem.
</p>

<p>
Both of these problems were fairly subtle and very hard to catch -
even with experience. I remember the hours I lost when I was learning
this stuff.
</p>

<p>
Some times kids get caught up in algorithms or poor code design but
sometimes, it's just the tools.
