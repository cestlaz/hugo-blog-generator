Spent most of vacation relaxing. Finished off the remaining college
recs, tried to catch up on sleep, and worked on a few project.
</p>

<p>
We've had an interesting December break dynamic in our household for
the past few years. My son, Natan is very much into his music, both as
a performer and a composer. A few years ago we discovered <a href="http://www.livingtraditions.org/docs/index_kk.htm">KlezKamp</a>. It
spoke to both Natan and Devorah. Batya, coming back from college
wasn't so into it and I was somewhat indifferent.
</p>

<p>
The end result is that for most of the first half of the break, Batya
and I were left on our own in the city while Natan and Devorah were up
in the Catskills.
</p>

<p>
So, what did we do? In addition to playing tourist, we rebuilt the
CSTUY web site (with a little help from her boyfriend Zach) - check it
out: <a href="http://cstuy.org/">cstuy.org</a>. I'm really happy with the result and now have a code
base that I'm happy with and can maintain.
</p>

<p>
I can't describe how awesome it is to be able to collaborate on
something real with ones daughter and I hope we can work on more
projects in the future.
</p>

<p>
Of course, I had my Natan time when he and Devorah got home. We spent
new years eve at the <a href="http://nygasp.org/">NYGASP</a> production of HMS Pinafore. Natan loves
opera and is something of a Savoyard and he's also a terrific
singer. Something he must have inherited from my father, although he
never met him.
</p>

<p>
So, we had our own project:
</p>

<p>
His is the good voice singing Dick Deadeye and I'm the not so good one
doing Captain Corcoran. We recorded it A Capella and he added the midi
after the fact. I think he had to change the key and I'm sure he had
to mess with the tempo.
</p>

<p>
Some of you might have noticed that I worked on the tech project with
Batya and the artsy one with Natan but don't worry - Natan's planning
on majoring in <a href="https://github.com/NZamansky">Computer Science</a> and Batya's the musical director and
an alto in <a href="http://www.thechainotes.com/">The
Chai Notes</a> up at Cornell.
</p>

<p>
So that was my break. Back to work in a couple of days.
