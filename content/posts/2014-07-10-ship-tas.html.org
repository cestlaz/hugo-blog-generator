I thought I'd share some thoughts on how we designed SHIP. I'll try to
talk about curriculum choices, tools and more in the coming week but
first, let's talk about our stewards.

When we first designed SHIP, we knew we wanted to run two rooms each
with around 24 shipmates and two teachers. We also figured that we'd want a
few of student teaching assistants, which I decided to name
Stewards - Natan wanted to call them Tars in tribute to the British
Navy, but he was outvoted.
</p>

<p>
We had some questions:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>what do we do with them when they're not working with the shipmates
</li>
<li>how old should they be
</li>
<li>what should they know
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
We knew that we'd be using <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a> as our development environment
for the shipmates <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> so we wanted the Stewards to know Java. We
also knew that when the shipmates worked on their group projects we'd
want to have one Steward mentor each group. That meant at least 12
Stewards. We went with 14. We also decided that we'd take kids that just
finished our AP CS classes at Stuyvesant since they were already well
versed in our lunacy and would help seed the culture we're looking to
grow.
</p>

<p>
What to do with them when they weren't working with the shipmates?
</p>

<p>
Most of the stewards will be in my SoftDev class come the fall so I
didn't want to just teach them that material
</p>

<p>
How about shepherding them through some advanced projects using the
tools that the shipmates would be using.
</p>

<p>
So, we had a plan. We'd have the stewards work in small groups on
interesting projects when they  weren't working with the shipmates.
</p>

<p>
How has it gone so far? Pretty well I think.
</p>

<p>
I first asked them to figure out how to work with the webcam and
images in processing &#x2013; at this point they can figure things out like
that on their own.
</p>

<p>
We then talked about edge detection and they coded it up. This also
proved to be a nice demo for the shipmates.
</p>

<p style="clear:both"></p>

<p>
After that I asked them to come up with their own algorithms for blob
detection. They came up with some interesting solutions after which I
let them look up techniques on line.
</p>

<p>
Why the image processing work? Many of the projects they want to work on are going to need to do image processing.
</p>

<p>
Now they're hammering out project proposals and getting to work. So
far I'm happy with what they're doing and delighted with the support
their giving the shipmates.
</p>

<p>
I don't know if other programs have teaching assistants and how they
use them but I'm pretty happy with our arrangement.
