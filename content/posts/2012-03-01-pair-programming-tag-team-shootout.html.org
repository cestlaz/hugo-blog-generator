So today we changed things up a bit.<br /><br />Instead of having a typical lab type periods, we tried the Pair Programming Tag Team Shootout.<br /><br />We aren't annualized so while the kids that have been with me since September have been working in pairs for a while, the other half of the class is just getting used to how we do it. I also wanted to get the kids to mix a little more.<br /><br />Hence the shootout.<br /><br />Everyone got a sheet with a bunch of problems on it:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/83400730/Shootout" style="-x-system-font: none; display: block; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-size-adjust: none; font-size: 14px; font-stretch: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 12px auto 6px auto; text-decoration: underline;" title="View Shootout on Scribd">Shootout</a><iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" data-aspect-ratio="0.772727272727273" data-auto-height="true" frameborder="0" height="600" id="doc_39108" scrolling="no" src="http://www.scribd.com/embeds/83400730/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=list&amp;access_key=key-2kfbc4856l652aq1j5ik" width="100%"></iframe><br /><br /><br />I then paired them off randomly.<br /><br />The idea is complete the first problem, find a new partner, repeat.<br /><br />By the end of the period each student worked with between five and seven partners.<br /><br />I'm having them send me their solutions and partners tonight.<br /><br />The early response was good -- it's speeding up them getting to know each other and it was a nice change of pace. We had some problems coordinating switching problems, but we'll do better next time.<br /><br />All in all a good day.<br /><br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-8898870113233862529?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
