Just completed the second time through for my Software Development
course. Last year we had a great time at our Demo Night hosted at
Google.
</p>

<p>
This year, unfortunately, due to a variety of reasons, we couldn't get
the event together. Still, the kids did great work so I thought I'd
share.
</p>

<p>
This year, I asked each group to make a short video.

First up, we've got bit&lt;&lt;shift - a search engine for code. Nice idea
and a really slick interface.

There were a bunch of other neat projects including a site that
crowd-sources 311 trash related problems and a version of the game
"Frozen Synapse" where you can program your forces using an embedded
Lisp interpreter.
</p>

<p>
Very cool stuff.
</p>

<p>
Good job guys!!!!!
