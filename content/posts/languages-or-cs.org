I was part of this conversation the other day:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When science teachers asked me if I taught AP Java I&#39;d always respond by asking them if they taught AP Microscope.</p>&mdash; Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) <a href="https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/883327927831711745">July 7, 2017</a></blockquote>

I always use that line to emphasize that I teach CS - a way of
thinking and problem solving and looking at the world. The languages
we use in our classes are tools to help us communicate ideas not the
ends but rather a means.

I've spent the past couple of days at the CSTA conference. It's been a
lot of fun. I've been spending the time with old friends and meeting
new ones and as everyone who knows me knows - I love talking shop.

I overheard a conversation today. One CS teacher describing what they
did to a few others. I overheard:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We teach Scratch then Swift and C++ and also teach Python
#+END_QUOTE

I heard statements like this describing programs more than a couple of
times. I know we're at a conference of CS Educators but even in this
community we have everything from beginners getting their feet wet to
hardcore computer scientists to everything in between.

We shouldn't be teaching languages as an ends unto themselves and the
majority of us don't.

What many of us do, though, is take the easy path and use the name of
a programming language to describe what we do rather than really
define what we do. This is why we hear "I teach Java" or "I teach a
class in Swift" even when the teacher teaching Java might really be
teaching Object Oriented program design and development or data
structures or something similar just using Java as the language or
tool.


I too fall into this trap but I try to catch myself. I try not to say
"I teach Scheme" but rather I'll say "I teach Scheme. Actually, we're
studying functional programming using Scheme as the language but for
convenience, I'll just say Scheme for the rest of this talk...."

The words we use to describe our field set the tone. If we're sloppy
and say "we teach Java," it's just like biology teacher saying "I
teach microscope."

As we try to define our field in the K12 space and seek equal footing
with established subject areas it's important that we use the right
language so that other educators and policy makers don't get the wrong
idea.
