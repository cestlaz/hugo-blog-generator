Over on Facebook, a fellow CS educator [fn:1] made a comment on something he
wanted to try with his students this summer: having the students
pre-disclose bugs when they submit their projects.

The post was asking for any links to "the literature." I can't speak
to that but I I've done something similar to what the post was asking
about so, as per usual, I thought I'd write about it here. It may not
be "research" but I'm more interested in teacher practices than ivory
towers anyway so here goes...

At a very basic level, I ask my students to provide a roadmap to any
project they submit - usually in a readme file. I basically ask:

- How to use the project
- What's cool and I should make sure to check out
- What doesn't work, where were the sticking points and what's the
status.

I tell my students that when I test the project, I'm not "out to get
them" and by their telling me how to navigate the project, it makes
sure I see things in the best possible light. I also tell them that I
will be more harsh on bugs that they don't tell me about -
particularly bugs that only occur some of the time.


I also encourage (and sometimes require) that students maintain a
changelog in their repo and also sometimes encourage them to have a
todo list and list of bugs and for longer projects, I expect to see
these and the readme updated over the course of the project (which
should always be up to date on [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse-2017-github-4][GitHub]], Dropbox or wherever the project
is living).

When the students provide a good write up it makes evaluating the
project much easier.


When students buy in, they're hopefully thinking more deeply about
their projects in terms of design and implementation and also from the
point of view of someone else using their product. When they maintain
the readme and other files over time, it also enables me to better
support them.


So, does this work? Yes but with some caveats. It works better once
the class and teacher know each other. If the students trust the
teacher they're more likely to be open and honest when they write up
the project. On the other hand, there will always be some students to
"phone it in" and do the bare minimum in terms of writing up their
projects.

The bottom line is that having the students do this is has a low cost
and is beneficial to both the students and the teacher. When it works,
it's great and when it doesn't, it's still pretty good.

made in a semi-private forum and I haven't asked permission.
