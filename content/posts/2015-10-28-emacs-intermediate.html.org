<p>
A good workman is known by his tools, or so the saying goes. My tools
of choice are my terminal shell and Emacs.
</p>

<p>
I suppose if I was a full time developer working with a limited set of
tools I might like an IDE like JetBrains or Eclipse but no matter how
many alternatives I try, I always end back in Emacs.
</p>

<p>
I recommend that my students spend time not only in Emacs but also in
tools like Vim or Sublime Text.
</p>

<p>
I do warn them, though, that as a commercial product, Sublime might
not be around forever, I mean before Sublime was sublime, TextMate was
sublime. If you go back to the 1980s, Brief was sublime.
</p>

<p>
Commercial tools come and go but I've been using Emacs since the mid
eighties.
</p>

<p>
A few students have been asking me for some pointers on going past the
basics of Emacs so here we go.

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline2">Notes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline2">
<p>
This post just has some getting started notes. There are mode powerful
and advanced ways of doing most things.
</p>

<p>
I think I'll just talk about a few of the basics here and will write
about code development with Emacs in a later post.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline3">Starting out</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline3">
<p>
Once you're OK with the basics (by using the built in tutorial or
on line resources) start to fore yourself to get to know:
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline4">Buffers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline4">
<p>
when you find a new file <b><b>(C-x C-f)</b></b> it opens it into a new
buffer. You can also open a new buffer using <b><b>C-x b</b></b> and rather than
selecting a buffer typing in a new buffer name.
</p>

<p>
Each buffer can hold a file and you can switch quickly between them
using <b><b>C-x b</b></b> and hitting <b>&lt;Enter&gt;</b>.
</p>

<p>
You can kill the current buffer with <b><b>C-x k</b></b>
</p>

<p>
Using buffers lets you edit multiple files in a project quickly and
efficiently.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline5">Windows</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline5">
<p>
Your Emacs frame can be split into multiple windows. <b><b>C-x 2</b></b> splits
the window top and bottom, <b><b>C-x3</b></b> left and right. You can switch
between windows using <b><b>C-x o</b></b> for other window. Switching to one
window is done with <b><b>C-x 1</b></b>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgheadline6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline6">Getting Help</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline6">
<p>
Get to know the built in help. You can always use functions like
<b><b>M-x describe-function</b></b> or <b><b>M-x describe-key</b></b> and of course
you can use completion to help speed things up but the help functions
are bound to:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>C-h k  for describe key</li>
<li>C-h f  for describe function</li>
<li>C-h a for search for command</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can usually type <b><b>q</b></b> to close the help.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline7">Navigation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline7">
<p>
Use search for navigation rather than arrow keys.
</p>

<p>
This can change the way you edit.
</p>

<p>
For example ,if I wanted to go up to the word Navigation, above,
rather than using traditional motion keys, I'd do a reverse search
(<b><b>C-r</b></b>) and search for Nav.
</p>

<p>
Incremental search forward (<b><b>C-s</b></b>) and back are your friends.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline8">Packages</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline8">
<p>
You can check out my emacs configuration here:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/zamansky/dotemacs"><a href="https://github.com/zamansky/dotemacs">https://github.com/zamansky/dotemacs</a></a>
</p>

<p>
You can find basic installation instructions there or you can use the
interactive package manager, invoking it with <b><b>M-x list-packages</b></b>.
</p>

<p>
Some of my favorite general purpose packages are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper">Swiper</a> - for navigation and finding files</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nflath/hungry-delete">Hungry Delete</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el">Expand Region</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-window">Ace Window</a></li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline9">Next steps</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline9">
<p>
We haven't even talked about code development or killer packages like
org-mode but I think this will do for a start.
