Some of the videos I want to make are going to be much easier to do if
I'm working in my own account where my whole file tree is available.

It's also a little annoying changing between my full emacs config and
the one I'm developing here.

So, I decided to move to this config for my real config and as I make
more videos move parts of my old configuration over to this new one.

The only problem is that I **need** some of my current config right
now -- things like my email setup.

This video talks about how I'm going to set things up to take care of
everything.
