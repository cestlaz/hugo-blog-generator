I'm sure I've mentioned that I've been an Emacs wonk for
decades. Since the mid-80's in fact. I've spent time using other
editors, word processors, and development tools but always find my way
back.

I recommend that budding computer science students develop a good tool
set and encourage them to explore Emacs but while it's pretty easy to
load Emacs and find your way around, particularly if you use the mouse
and menus there isn't a clear path to take you from beginner to using
it as an efficient tool let alone customizing it.

Inspired by [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q/featured][Mattias Petter Johansson]], or MPJ who make a weekly video,
I decided to try to create a series of YouTube videos and matching
blog posts. I'll try to post one a week and I'll try to keep the
videos, at least after the first couple to just a few minutes and have
them focus on [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/01/developing-emacs-micro-habits-text-automation/][micro-habits]] - one or two small things that you can
bring to your work flow and internalize.

The first three four (this one and the next three) will focus on
setting things up. After this post we'll have
- Setting up the package manager
- Intro to org-mode (just so that you recognize the markup)
- Intro to Elisp (just so you have an idea of those configuration
lines)

and then we're off to the races. Here's what I'm thinking about for
the first few topics after the above mentioned ones:

- Efficient Navigation
- Windows and Buffers
- Theming
- Auto Completion

and then a series of short topics to show some of my favorite editing
tools. We'll also cover some larger topics including:

- Python Development
- C/C++ Development
- Document Preparation
- Scheduling / Calendaring / Note Taking

I'll put together an index to these posts along with any ancillary
materials here: [[/stories/emacs][http://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs]].

* Getting started

This series is going to assume you've installed emacs and worked your
way through the included tutorial.

To help you get to that point, here are some links to posts and sites
that I've found useful:

And here's a 10 minute getting started guide:
