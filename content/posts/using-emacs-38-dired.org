The 38th installment of Using Emacs is about **dired**, Emacs' built
in mode for navigating and working with directories.

I'm not a dired power user and in fact am just now making a real
effort to explore it and work it into my daily workflow and
with that in mind, I'd love to hear some configuration and
use suggestions from people who use it regularly.

Here's the configuration I use:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}

(use-package dired+
:ensure t
:config (require 'dired+)
)


{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

which merely adds dired+ into the mix.

I also started playing with [[https://github.com/joddie/pcre2el][pcre2el]] which allows me to use the more
usual regex syntax in place of Emacs regex syntax in both dired and
other places. This is a big win for me since I never remember all the
escaping rules for Emacs regex.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
(use-package pcre2el
:ensure t
:config
(pcre-mode)
)

{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC


Finally, abo-abo and jcs have both written about new features in ,
Ivy/Swiper/Counsel that allow you to use ivy-occur to dump results
into a dired buffer ([[http://irreal.org/blog/?p=6760][link]], [[https://oremacs.com/2017/11/18/dired-occur/][link]]) but to get that to work, I needed to
install [[https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep][wgrep]] and also had to install and setup [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]] which looks to be
useful.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}

(use-package wgrep
:ensure t
)

(setq counsel-fzf-cmd "/home/zamansky/.fzf/bin/fzf -f %s")


{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

To help get started here are links to a couple of cheat sheets:
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/dired-ref.pdf][dired reference card]]
- [[https://harryrschwartz.com/assets/documents/dired-cheatsheet.pdf][another dired cheat sheet]]

I'll probably use dired more frequently but again, would love to hear
how other people are using it.
