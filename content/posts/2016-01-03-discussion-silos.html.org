In response to the past couple of days where my friends and fellow CS
Ed advocates Alfred Thompson, Rob Underwood, and I had a nice little
discussion via our blogs, Alfred wrote <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2016/01/when-blogging-works-for-educators.html">this</a>.
</p>

<p>
It's great when a number of voices in the community have an open
discussion but one of the things I found myself lamenting was the fact
that a lot of the discussion isn't truly accessible.
</p>

<p>
Why not?
</p>

<p>
The silo known as Facebook.
</p>

<p>
I have no problem with Facebook - I like it and use it daily - it's a great way to
keep in touch with former students turned friends. The problem is that
much like Las Vegas, discussions that happen on Facebook stay on
Facebook.
</p>

<p>
Recently I've seen a number of blog posts, some mine, some Alfred's,
some others where the post garnered nary a comment. Head over to
Facebook  and if you're friends with the right people, you might find
a lively, informative discussion.
</p>

<p>
In one case in particular, one post had independent, overlapping
discussions in at least three Facebook threads.
</p>

<p>
How much richer would the discussion have been  in a public forum
plus it would be left open for people to discover in the future.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I use <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>. I like it since I can also follow people on
it and I can just embed the code in any page but others like what
Wordpress or Blogger uses for comment threads. In any event, it keeps
the conversation open.
</p>

<p>
Is this really a problem? Maybe not but I do wish people would look
beyond Facebook for discussions.
</p>

<p>
It's something I've been trying to get my students to do for
years. I've used a number of tools for class communication:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>mail lists</li>
<li>Piazza</li>
<li>custom forum software like vanilla</li>
<li>slack</li>
</ul>

<p>
and haven't found anything that really does the job quite right. I'm
still looking.
</p>

<p>
The kids use these but invariably end up also setting up a Facebook
group for my class and their other classes. I encourage this - they
certainly should have a forum that I can't see. How else can they plan
that surprise party for me :-). In all seriousness though, ideally
they should have a forum free of teachers but they should use the one
with the teacher as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
The real problem with the kids setting up Facebook groups every year
is that there's no institutional memory. I see the kids, year after
year, have to clear the same hurdles. If they started thinking outside
of the silo of their Facebook communities and just had an ongoing
community for each class - one that passed on from year to year, it
would be of tremendous value for them.
</p>

<p>
So, I'd like to encourage everyone out there to get our discussions
out into public forums. It would be terrific if more of us would blog
or blog more often and also to take the time to add to the dialog in a
public place.
