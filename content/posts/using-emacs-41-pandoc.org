Another Emacs quick hit today. Actually, not really Emacs. Today's
video is a quick, really quick, look at [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]]. Pandoc is a document
converter.

Here are the formats that Pandoc can covert read from:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Markdown, CommonMark, PHP Markdown Extra, GitHub-Flavored Markdown,
MultiMarkdown, and (subsets of) Textile, reStructuredText, HTML,
LaTeX, MediaWiki markup, TWiki markup, TikiWiki markup, Creole 1.0,
Haddock markup, OPML, Emacs Org mode, DocBook, JATS, Muse, txt2tags,
Vimwiki, EPUB, ODT, and Word docx.
#+END_QUOTE

And here are the ones it can write to:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
plain text, Markdown, CommonMark, PHP Markdown Extra, GitHub-Flavored
Markdown, MultiMarkdown, reStructuredText, XHTML, HTML5, LaTeX
(including beamer slide shows), ConTeXt, RTF, OPML, DocBook, JATS,
OpenDocument, ODT, Word docx, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki markup, DokuWiki
markup, ZimWiki markup, Haddock markup, EPUB (v2 or v3), FictionBook2,
Textile, groff man, groff ms, Emacs Org mode, AsciiDoc, InDesign ICML,
TEI Simple, Muse, PowerPoint slide shows and Slidy, Slideous,
DZSlides, reveal.js, PDF
#+END_QUOTE


That's pretty impressive

I was faced with an html file describing a lab for all the CSCI13500
students at Hunter. I wanted to modify it for my class and that was
going to be a bear. I also wanted an easy way to have it render up on
GitHub. With pandoc, it was trivial. I just typed:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
{{< highlight "bash" >}}
pandoc -f html -t org -o lab3.org lab3.html
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

which converted the file to org-mode. This was trivial to edit and
then I uploaded it to GitHub as the lab's Readme.org file which GitHub
automatically renders on the project page.

Pandoc for the win.

I've also used pandoc to move between org-mode and word files.

If you haven't checked out pandoc, you should.
