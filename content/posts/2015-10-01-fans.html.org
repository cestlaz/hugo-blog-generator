Funny story from yesterday.
</p>

<p>
Devorah, my better half, is an assistant principal at another high
school. Yesterday evening, she was at work late for "curriculum
night." Parents came to the school after hours to hear a variety of
presentations.
</p>

<p>
During her presentation, Devorah mentioned her name, that she had two
former public school kids in college, and that's about it for the
personal info.
</p>

<p>
After the session, two parents approached Devorah to say "we're big
fans of your husband!"
</p>

<p>
Since when do teachers have fans?????????
</p>

<p>
I mean, I understand "my daughter/son was in your husbands class and
really enjoyed it," but "I'm a big fan?" She wasn't sure how to take
it. Obviously we both took it as an honor and compliment but we also
both got a chuckle out of the turn of phrase.
</p>

<p>
I've already said that teachers aren't <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2014/12/14/rockstar-godfather.html#.Vg264t8Sr0o">rock stars, we're blues men</a> so
I guess this shows that some folks still like the blues.
