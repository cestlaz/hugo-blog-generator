This post points to the next three videos in the Flask series.

The first covers setting up a droplet (virtual server) on
[[http://digitalocean.com][DigitalOcean]]. The second, deploying a flask application using [[http://gunicorn.org/][Green
Unicorn]], and the third, using [[https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs][sshfs]] to remotely mount your files from
your DO box to your local machine and how to set up DNS using [[http://freedns.afraid.org][FreeDNS]].
