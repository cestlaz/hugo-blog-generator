Over the past twenty years or so, I've mulled, discussed, and argued various aspects of education, computer science, and of course computer science education with friends, students, and colleagues.<br /><br />This past summer, I had the privilege to get to meet and briefly work with comp sci educators from around the country and started to thing that there were other like minded people, but we didn't have a forum with which to communicate.<br /><br />I also started to think that maybe some of the things I've discovered over the past twenty years might be useful to some one&nbsp; if only it were available.<br /><br />So, there you go. The plan is to regularly post about items of interest that I've come up&nbsp; with ranging from pedagogical techniques,&nbsp; to facilities management, to interesting class topics, to anything else that seems relevant. I'd imagine that some of my other interests, notably food, biking, and family will also creep in.<br /><br />Hope others find this interesting and relevant.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-2438686823306490556?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
