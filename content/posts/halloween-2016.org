It's Halloween and for the first time in 21 years, I'm not at work in costume.

It all began as a lark in October 1994:



<div align="center">
<a href="/img/2013-10-31-halloween/groo.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img width="30%" src="/img/2013-10-31-halloween/groo.jpg" class="" alt="" />
</a>
</div>


And grew from there. A partial list of characters include:

- Groo the Wanderer,
- Little Ceaser (Pizza Pizza)
- The Jolly Green Giant
- Homer Simpson (with my seniors as the rest of the cast)
- Duffman
- Hans and Franz (with Boris)
- The Hulk
- The Blues Brothers (with JonAlf)
- Dr. Evil (with JonAlf as Austin Powers)

While it was a lark, I noticed that days after, my students were
somewhat more relaxed and fun. If nothing else, it accelerated us
getting to know each other.

A likely turning point was when I was Bob Ross:

<a href="/img/2013-10-31-halloween/painting.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img width="30%" src="/img/2013-10-31-halloween/painting.jpg" class="" alt="" />
</a>
</div>


That was the first year that was just as performance based as it was costume based.

Of course, the downside is that pretty soon, I was expected to top
myself every year. The last couple of years were fun but part of me
felt like I was going through the motions. I needed a break.

So, now at Hunter College, I'm taking that break - no costume this
year. We'll see what the future holds, but here's a youtube playlist
with some of my favorite halloweens past.
