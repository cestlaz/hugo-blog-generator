We're practically at the close of 2013 and it's high time I wished
everyone wonderful things for the year to come.

It's also time for a new look to this blog.

Why the rewrite? Partly because I was tired of the look, but mostly
because, when I put it together, it was the first time I used that
toolset and was just figuring things out.

I'm still no expert, but I thought it was time to clean things up.

It's still a [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) generated blog hosted on
[GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/) but instead of using
[Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) I decided to use
[Ivory](http://weice.in/ivory/). It's much smaller and only does the
basics. Even the menu I'm using was the result of some online
searching for CSS stuff. I figure that this way, I'll actually learn
more about styling.

This should be an interesting year. I've got a number of projects that
I'm working on. Some within Stuyvesant, some revolving around [CSTUY](https://cstuy.org), and some I can't talk about right now. Hopefully I'll
be able to write about some of them in the coming weeks.

I'm also hoping to write more this year. I only posted 30 times this
past year. On the other hand, that's up from 18 times in 2012 and only
4 posts in 2011.

In addition to updates on CSTUY, pedagogical posts and the occasional
rant, I'd like to do a series on how I use tools like the Linux shell
and Emacs.

We'll see how things go.

For now, I wish you all a happy and healthy new year.
