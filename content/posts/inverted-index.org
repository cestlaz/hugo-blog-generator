I haven't spoken much about the class I've been teaching this
semester. It's an intro CS course - a programming heavy intro. I
decided to use Python with a transition at the end to C++. The
transition is to mirror Hunter's normal first CS course that ends with
a C++ intro to prepare the students for next semester's CS course
which is a more intense OOP class using C++ - the language we use in
our core courses.

Throughout the semester I've tried to use a variety of interesting
application areas so as to try to give the students some idea of the
possibilities that studying CS will open up for them.

After covering Python dictionaries and lists I thought we'd play by
building an inverted Index.

The basic idea is to map a set of words back to source files. For
example, given the following four one line files:


| files   |   |   | contents                             |
|---------+---+---+--------------------------------------|
| file.01 |   |   | if you prick us do we not bleed      |
| file.02 |   |   | if you tickle us do we not laugh     |
| file.03 |   |   | if you poison us do we not die and   |
| file.04 |   |   | if you wrong us shall we not revenge |
|---------+---+---+--------------------------------------|



You could build a data structure mapping each word back to the file(s)
that contain it (partially shown here),

| Word  |   | Files containing It's           |
|-------+---+---------------------------------|
| if    |   | file.01 file.02 file.03 file.04 |
| you   |   | file.01 file.02 file.03 file.04 |
| prick |   | file.01                         |
| us    |   | file.01 file.02 file.03 file.04 |
| do    |   | file.01 file.02 file.03         |
|-------+---+---------------------------------|


You can, of course, store more information - how many times a word
appears in a file, where it appears, etc.

This is a fairly easy structure to build. A dictionary where the keys
are the words in the file and the values are lists of the documents
containing the words.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
{{< highlight "python" >}}
inverted_index = {
'if' : ['file.01','file.02','file.03','file.04'],
'you' : ['file.01','file.02','file.03','file.04'],
'prick' : ['file.01'],
'us' : ['file.01','file.02','file.03','file.04'],
'do' : ['file.01','file.02','file.03'],
...
}

{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

In addition to letting us work with dictionaries and lists, we can
also review file access and even the python CSV module if we want.

We can immediately write simple queries -- "what document(s) contain
the word 'prick,' but things get more interesting if you write
functions to perform **and** and **or** queries - "what document(s)
contain the words 'prick' **or** 'do'" for instance.

Why are we building this (besides as a data structure and programming
exercise)? I've seen a number of references to using an inverted index
when building a web search engine. In fact, I think that's something
you do early on in the Udacity Mooc. I just wanted to play with
information retrieval.

I remembered that there was a collection of information, including
last statements from [[https://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html][executed offenders in Texas]]. Someone conveniently
converted it into a [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HAjZTtPriClY-X3n9whTkA4i5D7bn3bmtHnLoaVICvI/edit#gid=1][Google Spreadsheet]]. The format's a little
different from our simple four file example but then there's more
data. It's straightforward enough to download the spreadsheet as a CSV
file and then read it with a Python program that builds it into an
inverted index.

Now we have some interesting data to play with.

How many offenders used words like "sorry" or "apologize?" How about
references to religion? We can do all sorts of **and** and **or**
queries.

We just played with this a bit but I could see all sorts of
explorations. What about taking some great work of literature and
turning it into an inverted index by chapter. You could query
characters or certain words and see where and when they appear in the
book. A new and different way of exploring literature.

So, there you have it - an interesting little project we played with
this past semester. We did it in an intro Python course but I could
see it as an interesting project in AP CS A using hashmaps and lists.
