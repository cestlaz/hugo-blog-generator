A while ago I did a couple of videos on how I use org-capture
([[http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-23-capture-1/][part 1]], [[http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-24-capture-2/][part 2]]). I didn't get into a big part of org-capture - how I
use org-mode and capture to manage my calendar and todo lists.

I was waiting to see if I liked my current setup - using [[https://github.com/myuhe/org-gcal.el][org-gcal]] to
sync with my Google Calendar for appointments while using my main org
file for my todo list.

Coincidentally, Rainer KÃ¶nig recently put up a video on how he [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIzzjSaq2N8&amp;list=PLVtKhBrRV_ZkPnBtt_TD1Cs9PJlU0IIdE&amp;index=33][syncs
with his Google calendar]]. He uses a different method than the one I
present in this video so make sure to check out his approach. In fact,
you should check out his entire [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVtKhBrRV_ZkPnBtt_TD1Cs9PJlU0IIdE][series on org-mode]].

Here's the code I use install org-gcal. The video steps through
setting up things on the Google side. You'll have to replace the
**client ID** and **client secrets** in the code below as well as use
your calendar name and whatever org file you want to sync with.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
(setq package-check-signature nil)


(use-package org-gcal
:ensure t
:config
(setq org-gcal-client-id "oauth 2.0 client ID"
org-gcal-client-secret "client secret"
org-gcal-file-alist '(("zamansky@gmail.com" .  "~/Dropbox/orgfiles/gcal.org"))))


{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

I use these two hooks to sync things semi-automatically. The first
hook syncs whenever I load the agenda. Since this happens in the
background, if I just added something to my calendar, I might have to
reload the agenda by hitting **r** in the agenda view.

The second hook syncs with my Google calendar when I capture.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}

(add-hook 'org-agenda-mode-hook (lambda () (org-gcal-sync) ))
(add-hook 'org-capture-after-finalize-hook (lambda () (org-gcal-sync) ))


{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

Here are the rest of my settings. The org files I want to include in
my agenda views:
- gcal.org -- the one I'm syncing
- i.org -- my main org file for todo items (the todo capture places
things in here)
- schedule.org -- my old schedule before I was syncing with
Google. Not active anymore. I should probably remove it.

Also, my capture settings:


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
(setq org-agenda-files (list "~/Dropbox/orgfiles/gcal.org"
"~/Dropbox/orgfiles/i.org"
"~/Dropbox/orgfiles/schedule.org"))


(setq org-capture-templates
'(("a" "Appointment" entry (file  "~/Dropbox/orgfiles/gcal.org" )
"* %?\n\n%^T\n\n:PROPERTIES:\n\n:END:\n\n")
("l" "Link" entry (file+headline "~/Dropbox/orgfiles/links.org" "Links")
"* %? %^L %^g \n%T" :prepend t)
("b" "Blog idea" entry (file+headline "~/Dropbox/orgfiles/i.org" "Blog Topics:")
"* %?\n%T" :prepend t)
("t" "To Do Item" entry (file+headline "~/Dropbox/orgfiles/i.org" "To Do")
"* TODO %?\n%u" :prepend t)
("n" "Note" entry (file+headline "~/Dropbox/orgfiles/i.org" "Note space")
"* %?\n%u" :prepend t)
("j" "Journal" entry (file+datetree "~/Dropbox/journal.org")
"* %?\nEntered on %U\n  %i\n  %a")
("s" "Screencast" entry (file "~/Dropbox/orgfiles/screencastnotes.org")
"* %?\n%i\n")))
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC



The end result is that I can add an event in my Google calendar (or
accept a calendar invite) and it appears in my org-mode
agenda. Likewise, I can add a scheduled event using capture and it
will sync up to Google. I can also just add an event by editing
gcal.org but then would have to run **org-gcal-post-at-point** to send
it up to Google.

Now, I can use bring up a regular agenda **C-a a**, my todo list **C-a
t** or by adding a custom agenda command:


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
'(("c" "Simple agenda view"
((agenda "")
(alltodo "")))))
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

a combined agenda and todo view using **C-a n**


Finally, there's [[https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-calfw][calfw]]. It's a nice tool to view calendars in
Google. I don't use it much anymore but it is nice:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}

(use-package calfw
:ensure ;TODO:
:config
(require 'calfw)
(require 'calfw-org)
(setq cfw:org-overwrite-default-keybinding t)
(require 'calfw-ical)

(defun mycalendar ()
(interactive)
(cfw:open-calendar-buffer
:contents-sources
(list
;; (cfw:org-create-source "Green")  ; orgmode source
(cfw:ical-create-source "gcal" "https://somecalnedaraddress" "IndianRed") ; devorah calender
(cfw:ical-create-source "gcal" "https://anothercalendaraddress" "IndianRed") ; google calendar ICS
)))
(setq cfw:org-overwrite-default-keybinding t))

(use-package calfw-gcal
:ensure t
:config
(require 'calfw-gcal))
