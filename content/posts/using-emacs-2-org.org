This video is a brief introduction to org-mode, a mode I use for all
sorts of things.

We'll dive into org-mode later in the series. Right now I just want
you to see the basics since we'll be using org-mode for any notes that
are written up during this series.

Actually, all my blog posts are written in org-mode.

Here are the important lines to add to your Emacs *init.el* file  to
get the nice looking bullets when in org-mode:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
{{< highlight "python" >}}
(use-package org-bullets
:ensure t
:config
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-bullets-mode 1))))
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC


About a month ago, Emacs user Harry Schwartz gave a nice overview talk
on org-mode. If you want to get a better idea as to all the things you
can do with it, check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4

Next time, we'll look at a little Elisp. After that, we'll dive in to
using Emacs effectively and efficiently.
