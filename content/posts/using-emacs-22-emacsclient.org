Another quick hit today.

This video is really setting the stage for hte next two, where I talk about org-mode capturing.

Today, we're demoing the use of the emacs server and client.

Back in the old days, emacs took a LOOONG time to load. A complex
conviguration could take on the order of 10 to 20 seconds. This
resulted in people loading emacs at the start of the day and leaving
it up forever. While load times aren't much of an issue anymore, it's
still nice to leave emacs around all the time.

That's where running emacs as a server comes in.. I set up a keyboard shortcut my window manager to run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
{{< highlight "sh" >}}
emacsclient -a "" -c
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

Rather than trying to run emacs, this tries to connect to an already
running emacs server. The **-c** creates a new frame. Instead if you
use **-t** it will open emacs in the terminal. The **-a ""** tells
emacs to run itself as a server (daemon) if it isn't already running.


Later on, running **emacsclient -c** will very quickly bring up a new frame to the server.

In addition to instant loading, Running emacs this way has the
advantage, or some may say disadvantage of keeping buffers around
forever since you just keep emacs up and running.
