If you keep Emacs open all the time you end up accumulating lots of
buffers. That can make navigating a little bit awkward.

[[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]] is a really nice package that makes navigating in and
between projects much easier. I also have [[https://github.com/ericdanan/counsel-projectile][counsel-projectile]]
installed.

Here's my configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
;; projectile
(use-package projectile
:ensure t
:config
(projectile-global-mode)
(setq projectile-completion-system 'ivy))

(use-package counsel-projectile
:ensure t
:config
(counsel-projectile-on))
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

Projectile considers a sub-directory tree to be a project if it's a
git or other source control repo, if it's created by tool like lein,
maven, or sbt, or if you put an empty file named **.projectile** in
the root directory of the project.

Projectile learns about projects when you open a file in that project
and then stores that information in an Emacs bookmark file in your
.emacs.d directory.

You can switch between projects using ~C-c p~ and when in a project,
load another file using ~C-c f~. If you use the **which-key** package
as I do, just type ~C-c~ - the projectile prefix and then which-key
will bring up help.

The video goes through some of my favorite features and you can find
the full documentation can be found [[http://projectile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][here]].


The other package I show is [[https://github.com/jacktasia/dumb-jump][dumb-jump]]. It's basically a zero (or
almost zero) configuration tags replacement. Really nice.

Here's my current config:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
(use-package dumb-jump
:bind (("M-g o" . dumb-jump-go-other-window)
("M-g j" . dumb-jump-go)
("M-g x" . dumb-jump-go-prefer-external)
("M-g z" . dumb-jump-go-prefer-external-other-window))
:config (setq dumb-jump-selector 'ivy) ;; (setq dumb-jump-selector 'helm)
:ensure)

:config
;; (setq dumb-jump-selector 'ivy) ;; (setq dumb-jump-selector 'helm)
:init
(dumb-jump-mode)
:ensure
)
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC


Enjoy.
