As a teacher, sometimes your gut tells you to do something and it
turns out to be a really good idea.
</p>

<p>
That's what happened in October, 1994. I decided to dress up as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groo_the_Wanderer">Groo
the Wanderer</a> for Halloween. I never dressed in costume for school
before and back then, no many did. A few students and very few
teachers.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards, I noticed that my younger students - the ones that didn't
know me that well yet, really loosened up and so a tradition was born.
</p>

<p>
Over each of the next 20 Halloweens, I did something
different. Sometimes solo, sometimes as a pair and more recently as
part of a team.
</p>

<p>
What started as a lark has now become something of an obligation but
it's still fun.
</p>
