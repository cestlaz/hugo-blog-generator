Got in to Amsterdam NY a few hours ago. Just finished mapping out tomorrow's route. Hope to get all the details and pictures for the past three days up tomorrow or Sunday. Too sleepy to do it now.<br /><br />Miles Yesterday: 44.5<br />Miles Today: 49<br />Total: 362.5 (but I think I lost a handful of miles somewhere).<br /><br />Tomorrow we make our way to Albany.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-4149788241103838418?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
