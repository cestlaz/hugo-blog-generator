I just got back from SIGCSE2018 - the big annual conference on
computer science education. Although I've been in this racket for
decades, this was only my second SIGCSE and once again I had a blast.

As with most conferences, a highlight was the "hallway track" where I
got to spend time with friends and colleagues from all over the
country. I also got to check off a few names from the "people I've
been following online and want to meet in person" list. There are a
few more on the list but it's getting smaller.

The theme was *CS For All* but the range of topics covered was both
wide and deep.

For me, I left thinking about a few themes:

- College faculty can learn a lot from K12 teachers in terms of
pedagogy and teaching.
- So can "thought leaders," policy makers, and big companies.
- Colleges face a huge challenge in both developing pedagogues and
transfering pedagogical knowledge over to researchers.
- Can you do both CS4All and have quality CS teachers in the short
term (I doubt it)?
- Researchers vs Practitioners and the value of listening to one or
the other.
- Nifty assignments are frequently regular assignments reskinned with
graphics.

There were a few sessions that dissapointed me but most of the ones I
attende were terrific. I thought I'd blog about some of them in detail over
the next few weeks.

Here are the sessions I'm planning on writing about:

- [[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3159597][Implementing Malloc: Students and SYstems Programming]] presented by Brian
Railing
- [[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3159471][Creativity, Customization, and Onwership: Game Design in Bootstrap:
Algebra]], presented by Kathi Fisher
- [[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3159527][An Explicit Strategy to Scaffold Novice Program Tracing]], presented
by Benjamin Xie
- [[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3159557][Strategies for Basing the CS Theory Course on Non-decision Problems]],
presented by John MacCormick
- [[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3159609][Connect the Dots to Prove It: A Novel Way to Learn Proof
Construction]], by McCartin-Lim, Woolf, and Mcregor
- Google Supporter Session on Incorporating Machine Learning into
University Courses.
- [[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3170601][Nifty Assignments]]

I might talk about a few other sessions as well.

Overall it was a great conference. I look forward to sharing my
experiences with all of you in the coming posts.
