I just read <a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo">Alfred Thompson's</a> predictions for next year. I was going
to leave a comment but since it would have gotten somewhat long
winded, I thought I'd comment in a post of my own.
</p>

<p>
If you haven't read Alfred's post yet, check it out:

<h2 id="unnumbered-1">On more states allowing CS to count for a graduation requirement:</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-unnumbered-1">
<p>
Alfred's probably right but I'm leery. Sure, it could end up terrific
but I could see a number of ways this could play out badly.
</p>

<p>
We could end up with non-cs classes to count as CS or we could see
schools allowing real CS to count but there would be no incentive for
a school to actually create any meaningful CS classes
much less for kids to take them.
</p>

<p>
I guess the root of my concern probably relates two of my concerns
about education in general:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Real, experienced teachers aren't driving policy in education in
general and CS is and will  be no different. We're going to be left
with something forced down from above and I fear it will be bad.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
and
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm not a big fan of education education. As schools of education
get involved they will have more of a voice. I think one of the
worst things to happen to math education over the course of my
career has been "Math Ed." I fear CS Ed will have the same effect
on K12 CS education.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Maybe I'm a pessimist or maybe I've just been burned one to many times
or maybe it's that as a public school teacher I see the negative
effect of politics and money on public education but at least in NYC I
see where the decision making is coming from and I'm not encouraged.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, even if I'm right and the powers that be really
screw things up,there should always be at least a few people who see
through they hype and that's where I can continue to do positive work.

<div id="outline-container-unnumbered-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="unnumbered-2">On Python continuing to grow</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-unnumbered-2">
<p>
It's been one of my go to languages for a while now. I've been using
it in and out of classes since some time in the mid 90s.
</p>

<p>
I don't see it replacing Java in AP CS and it looks like Scratch has
the inside track CS Principles but it's good for so many things and
has such a low cost of entry, I again feel that Alfred's right.
</p>

<p>
The fact that it's easy for a non-cs teacher to pick up, at least to a
limited degree, will certainly help the charge. I'm not sure if long
term, this is a good thing, but it will help to push python's growth in education.
</p>

<p>
As a side note on Java &#x2013; I'm not personally a fan, but there good things in there that would be lost
with a total shift to languages like Python.

<div id="outline-container-unnumbered-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="unnumbered-3">On CS Principles</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-unnumbered-3">
<p>
I do see a time where the course is forced on Stuy but I'm
not worrying about it for the moment. I think we already teach a
stronger course and by the time CS Principles becomes an issue at
Stuy, I'll probably be gone.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-unnumbered-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="unnumbered-4">Chromebooks</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-unnumbered-4">
<p>
I could see chromebooks working out for CS but only if schools don't
lock them down. Out of the box, you can only use cloud based
development environments. This is surely limiting but if you have the bandwidth, between
<a href="http://codesters.com/">codesters.com</a>, <a href="http://koding.com/">koding.com</a>, cloud9, Dr.Racket and assorted other tools
you can certainly do some good CS.
</p>

<p>
The upside comes when you can drop into the Linux shell. I've been
playing with a C720 Intel chromebook recently. It's small and
lightweight and once I set it up, it was running Dr. Racket, NetLogo,
Python, Java, Processing (all with a fairly hefty Emacs install).
</p>

<p>
Will it run everything? I don't know, but if I can get a new lab of
computers and have the freedom to custom install the machines, I'm
seriously considering chromebooks.
</p>

<p>
I'm also recommending them to my kids looking for a cheap portable
development environment.

<p>
I've never been one for my own predictions - maybe because I'm more of
a continuous journey rather than destination type of guy so I'll hold
off on my own predictions for now, but I'll close with a direct
shoutout &#x2013; Hey Alfred - thanks for posting your predictions - good food for thought
as is your blog in general.
