What's been happening since the close of the school year? We've been
getting ready to start <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2014/04/07/ship-announce.html">SHIP</a> - CSTUY's first summer program.
</p>

<p>
SHIP will be running starting this Monday through the end of July and
should be a great adventure.
