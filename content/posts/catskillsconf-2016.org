Waking up to a beautiful brisk morning at the Ashokan Center in the Hudson Valley.

Last year, Devorah and I attended the first [[http://catskillsconf.com][Catskillsconf]], a tech
conference in Olivebridge, NY. It was an amazing and unique
experience. I can only describe it as Tech Conference meets Summer
camp. Where else can you hear talks by people like [[https://twitter.com/dens?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor][Dennis Crowley]] and
an alos hear the music of [[http://www.mikeandruthy.com/][Mike and ruthy]].

This year, I gave another educaiton rant and to add to the fun,
Devorah's been leading a knitting for Charity project and teaching
attendees to knit:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Progress on the charity knitting project led by <a href="https://twitter.com/DevorahZamansky">@DevorahZamansky</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/catskillsconf">@catskillsconf</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/catskillsconf?src=hash">#catskillsconf</a> <a href="https://t.co/yoal7r48wO">pic.twitter.com/yoal7r48wO</a></p>&mdash; Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) <a href="https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/790155915307737088">October 23, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

and we brought up my Hunter College students to join in the fun.

In spite of the fact that we were out late at the bonfiere:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ending a great day by relaxing next to the fire <a href="https://twitter.com/catskillsconf">@catskillsconf</a>. <a href="https://t.co/LzKbftZamz">pic.twitter.com/LzKbftZamz</a></p>&mdash; Christopher Short (@Shortoutloud) <a href="https://twitter.com/Shortoutloud/status/790020785943539712">October 23, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

and then were kept up by the students bonding and chatting in the
bunkhouse, Devorah and I are first up, bright and early.

I'll write up more about this amazing event some time over the
week. Right now, I think I'll just go out and enjoy a cup of coffee
and the clean brisk Hudson Valley air.
