Today marked the last day of classes and time for the 8th annual Stuy
CS Semi Formal.

What's the Stuy CS Semi Formal? It's another bad idea that we refuse
to let die. Eight years ago JonAlf joked that someone in class joked
that they should have a party and they should all get dressed up. My
thought? "YEAH!!! LET'S DO IT!!!!!"
</p>

<p>
Eight years later, still going strong.
</p>

<p>
We cleaned out and decorated the room - classed things up by serving
cheese, dried fruits, nuts and the like. Drinks served in fake plastic
"wine" glasses and we encouraged the kids to dress up.

<p>
Kids can come and go any period they don't have any other class.
</p>

<p>
It's a signature event and a fun time. Whats more is that throughout
the day you've got pockets of CS students all dressed to the nines in
all their other classes.
</p>

<p>
For the first few years JonAlf and I did the heavy lifting but these
past two, it's all been the students - particularly Jenny, Miranda,
and Veronika (apologies if I'm missing anyone).
</p>

<p>
It's just another event that makes StuyCS unique.
