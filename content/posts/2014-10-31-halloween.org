Little did I know that a goof of an idea would turn into a twenty year tradition.
This year, I had a chance to team up with Natan in his senior

Batya cameoing in our Austin Powers - Dr. Evil sketch. This time it

Ultimate Darkness" for some time now. We knew it wouldn't have the
room rolling on the floor with Laughter but we had a lot of fun and I think the classes enjoyed it.
