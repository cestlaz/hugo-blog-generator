This is a good time to be an Emacs user. In addition to all of the
great packages and tools being developed there seem to be more people
regularly blogging and making videos about Emacs than ever before.

[[http://planet.emacsen.org/][Planet Emacsen]] aggregates a ton of Emcas blogs and Emacs Legend Sacha
Chua posts what's going on in emacs every week on her [[http://sachachua.com/blog/category/geek/emacs/][blog]].

on the video front, [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucdetz7akmws0_gnjog01d2g][uncle dave]] has recently joined the ranks of emacs
video producers. sometimes we'll cover the same topic. dave made a
video on swiper the other week and i made one a year ago. the other
week we both made videos on mpd almost on the same day but dave
focussed on emms and i focussed on simple-mpc. i think this
is great because it gives different perspectives.

today, i watched dave's video on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xewzfruru6k&t=854s][company]] mode for auto
completion. I've always used [[http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-8-autocomplete/][autocomplete]] mode. I thought it would be
a good time for me to see how the other half lived.

You can find my configurations up on GitHub
([[https://github.com/zamansky/using-emacs][https://github.com/zamansky/using-emacs]]). The master branch is using
autocomplete and the company-test branch for company. I've also pulled
out the relevant code and am placing it down under the video.

Here's what I've found so far:
