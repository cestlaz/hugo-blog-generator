<p>
The NY Times just posted an article - the  mayor announced a 10 year
deadline by which time all NYC public school students will be taking
CS.
</p>

<p>
I should be happy.
</p>

<p>
I'm not.
</p>

<p>
I feel thoroughly defeated.
</p>

<p>
As many of you know, I've struggled for years to try to bring CS
education to more kids and to train more teachers. You also probably
know that over the years, I've become pretty good at this.
</p>

<p>
Why am I feeling so down about this.
</p>

<p>
Because despite my best efforts I'm no closer to my goal than day one.
</p>

<p>
Stuy is no closer to recognizing CS. I'm still a just math teacher
and the DOE has given the job of running CS education to person after
person none whom had any real CS experience and few who have had any
real teaching experience.
</p>

<p>
I see plans based on dropping in curricula and quick fixes.
</p>

<p>
I see programs run by people still wet behind the ears with respect to
CS Education.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I feel like I'm the only sane person in the room, or maybe
I'm the loony. I'm not sure.
</p>

<p>
Probably because I don't play well with others.
</p>

<p>
So I feel defeated.
</p>

<p>
Defeated because I know I have something to offer that the kids of NYC
deserve.
</p>

<p>
Defeated because I know they're not going to get it.
</p>

<p>
I'm already looking to leave Stuy and public education.
</p>

<p>
Maybe this is just another sign that it's time.
</p>
