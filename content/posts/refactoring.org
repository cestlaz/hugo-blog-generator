One of my laments on teaching computer science is that students are
rarely taught and given the chance to develop  good programming
practices. There's usually not enough time. Beginners work on small
"toys" which don't lend themselves to good software development
practices and later on, there's so much other material like
algorithms, data structures etc. to teach and
learn that programming practices usually amount to lines like:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"Make sure to comment your code.."

"Indent properly..."

"Use functions..."

"It's important to test your code..."
#+END_QUOTE

so when I see an opportunity to use a simple example to drive home a
good practice,  I try to jump on it.

Drawing shapes with text is a typical early project. I've seen it in
text books and online and have been doing it for years. I recall doing
it back in the 80s in Fortran IV when the programs we wrote were on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card][punch cards]], run
overnight on an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1130][IBM 1130]], and printouts picked up the next day.

It's a nice use of nested loops. The students will write functions to
create assorted shapes out of asterisks  like rectangles and
triangles. Typical solutions look like this:


#+BEGIN_SRC C++
{{< highlight "c" >}}
#include <iostream>


std::string box(int h, int w){
std::string r = "";
for (int i = 0; i < h; ++i) {
for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
r = r + "*";
}
r = r + "\n";
}
return r;
}


std::string tri(int h){
std::string r = "";
for (int i = 0; i < h; ++i) {
for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
r = r + "*";
}
r = r + "\n";
}
return r;
}

{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

Which results in shapes like these:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

| ****            |    | *               |
| ****            |    | **              |
| ****            |    | ***             |
| ****            |    | ****            |
| ****            |    |                 |
|                 |    |                 |
|                 |    |                 |
| *************** |    | *               |
| *************** |    | **              |
| *************** |    | ***             |
| *************** |    | ****            |
| *************** |    | *****           |
| *************** |    | ******          |
| *************** |    | *******         |

#+END_EXAMPLE

Then there will be more interesting shapes including things like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

*       *            *****
**      ***           *   *            and more
***     *****          *   *
****      ***           *****

#+END_EXAMPLE

This is a great time to talk about refactoring.  All of the shape
drawing functions follow the same pattern - there's an outer loop for
the height and then one or more inner loops to draw each line. We can
factor out the inner loops in to a separate ~line()~ function.


#+BEGIN_SRC C++
{{< highlight "c" >}}
#include <iostream>


std::string box(int h, int w){
std::string r = "";
for (int i = 0; i < h; ++i) {
for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {     //
r = r + "*";                    // <----- This can be factored out
}                                 //
r = r + "\n";
}
return r;
}


std::string tri(int h){
std::string r = "";
for (int i = 0; i < h; ++i) {
for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {    //
r = r + "*";                   // <---------------- along with this
}                               //
r = r + "\n";
}
return r;
}

{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

It's just like factoring in algebra:

#+BEGIN_LATEX

(RectangleOuterLoop \times Line) + (TriangleOuterLoop \times Line) \Rightarrow Line  (Rectangleouterloop \times TriangleOuterloop)

#+END_LATEX

We end up with:

#+BEGIN_SRC C++
{{< highlight "c" >}}
#include <iostream>

std::string line(int w, std::string c){
std::string r = "";
for (int i = 0; i < w; ++i) {
r = r + c;
}
return r;
}

std::string box(int h, int w){
std::string r = "";
for (int i = 0; i < h; ++i) {
r = r + line(w,"*") + "\n";
}
return r;
}


std::string tri(int h){
std::string r = "";
for (int i = 0; i < h; ++i) {
r = r + line(i,"*") + "\n";
}
return r;
}


{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC


It's simpler, cleaner, and also can lead us to thinking about the
"harder" shapes in an interesting way. Instead of looking at the right
justified triangle as a triangle, we can think of each level as two
lines - one of spaces (shown here as dashes) followed by a line of
stars:


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
----*       *
---**      **
--***     ***
-****    ****
*****   *****

#+END_EXAMPLE

Noticing that  for a height of 5, the dashed lines count down in
length 4,3,2,1,0 and the star lines count up 1,2,3,4,5, we get:

#+BEGIN_SRC C++
{{< highlight "c" >}}

std::string tri2(int h){
std::string r = "";
for (int i = 0; i < h; ++i) {
r = r + line(h-i-1,"-") + line(i+1,"*") + "\n";
}
return r;
}

int main()
{
std::string r = tri2(5);
std::cout << r << std::endl;
return 0;
}
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

Here we have typical early CS assignment that really lends itself to
talking about structuring programs and refactoring. Where else can we
inject good programming practices in ways that make sense early on?
