Out of the box, Emacs supports various types of completion.

Tab completion for filenames and commands basically work right out of
the box and Emacs has built in modes like [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AbbrevMode][Abbrev]], [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HippieExpand][Hippie Expand]], and
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dynamic-Abbrevs.html][Dabbrev]] provide a manner of completion for in buffer text.

I briefly show Dabbrev (Dynamic Abbrevs) in the video and if you're
interested in the others, follow the links.

We saw ow the built in Ido mode and third party packages like Ivy,
which I prefer, and Helm make for better completions on functions,
filenames, and the like and Emacs also has third party packages for in
buffer completion.

The two main contenders are [[https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete][auto-complete Mode]] and [[http://company-mode.github.io/%0A][company Mode]]. I use
auto-complete, others swear by company. The video shows the basics of
auto-complete mode but check both out and decide for yourself.

If you feel strongly about one or the other, please share in the
comments.


Here's a basic configuration:


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
(use-package auto-complete
:ensure t
:init
(progn
(ac-config-default)
(global-auto-complete-mode t)
))
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

We'll modify this as move along in the series.

Here's the video:
