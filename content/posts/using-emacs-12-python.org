This week, we're going to look at my setup for Python programming.

I'm an educator, not a professional developer so I'm not working in
huge code bases with dozens or more files at a time. I do periodically
work in medium size code bases and will talk about cross file
navigation and project management later on. There are also more
powerful emacs Python packages. One being [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy][elpy]]. Elpy looks pretty cool
but for me, it's overkill.

Today's about the basics.

The first tool I show is [[http://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/][flycheck]]. It does code checking on the fly
and supports [[http://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/languages.html#flycheck-languages][tons of languages]]. You might have to install some
external checkers though. For instance, I installed **pylint** for
python syntax checking with:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
{{< highlight "bash" >}}
sudo pip install pylint
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

Cofiguring flycheck is as easy as:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
(use-package flycheck
:ensure t
:init
(global-flycheck-mode t))
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC


The video all shows how I like to run Python from within emacs.

The other tool I use is [[https://github.com/tkf/emacs-jedi][Jedi]]. It provides more extensive completion
for Python.

Here's the setup:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
(use-package jedi
:ensure t
:init
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'jedi:setup)
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'jedi:ac-setup))
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

The last hook sets up the autocomplete.

For jedi to work, you'll need to install the jedi server which is done
in emacs by running **M-x jedi:install-server**. For that to work,
though, you'll need to have [[http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/][Python Virtualenv]] istalled. I did that
with:

**EDIT:** I just got a report that you might need to also install epc (**sudo pip install epc**).


#+BEGIN_SRC bash
{{< highlight "bash" >}}
sudo pip install virtualenv
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC
