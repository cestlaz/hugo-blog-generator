Now that we have a nice basic configuration, let's make Emacs look a
little nicer.

Like most editors, Emacs can be extensively themed.

As shown in the video, you can quickly see the built in themes using
the **customize-themes** command.

You can load one of these themes by using the **load-theme** command
interactively or, more likely by putting:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
(load-theme 'leuven t)
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

in your init.el. The above code loads the built in **leuven** theme.

I prefer the **zenburn** theme. For that, you have to load the zenburn
package. Here's the code in our init.el:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
(use-package zenburn-theme
:ensure t
:config (load-theme 'zenburn t))
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

In the video, I also mention the color theme package.

So, customize away.

In the links, you'll find some links to some Emacs theme gallery sites
to help find something you like.

Thanks for reading and watching and as always, please leave comments,
suggestions and favorite themes.

Here's the video:
