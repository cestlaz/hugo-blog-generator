Happy to be back after a couple of weeks.

My wife and son spent some time in San Francisco, Mountain View, and
Seattle. The main reason was to see our daughter who's interning out
there for the summer but it was also a great opportunity to catch up
with over 100 former students. If you're interested in seeing more, I
wrote a bit about it [[http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/end-to-act-1/#.V45OGt9vGAk][here]].

I was originally going to start talking about Python development but
then saw [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/4sp0xs/emacs_org_mode_and_revealjs/][this]] post on reddit about [[https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/][reveal.js]] and using it with
org-mode. Since reveal.js with org-mode  is my goto presentation tool
I thought I'd do a video on that before getting back to "your
regularly schedueld program."

#+begin_export html
  <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/psDpCpcIVYs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  #+end_export html
  

The main package you have to use for reveal.js presentations in
org-mode is org-reveal. The package to install is **ox-reveal**. I also
installed **htmlize** for syntax highlighting. Here's the code from
our configuration file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
{{< highlight "emacs-lisp" >}}
(use-package ox-reveal
:ensure ox-reveal)

(setq org-reveal-root "http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/reveal.js/3.0.0/")
(setq org-reveal-mathjax t)

(use-package htmlize
:ensure t)
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

The org-reveal-root setq tells your presentation where to find the
reveal.js code. In this example, we're getting from the cloud. You can
also install it locally.

The org-reveal-mathjax is just so that LaTeX equations will look nice.

I'm hoping the video is pretty self-explanitory and the org-reveal
[[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal%0A][home page]] is pretty thorough but since the documentation is lagging a
bit behind the code and due to some versioning issues, here are a
couple of things to watch out for:
- I made a **samples** folder where I'll put code for this series that
isn't part of the configurations.
- I showed **:frag (roll-in)** as an example of revealing list items
one at a time. Those parens are important and are needed but weren't
in earlier versions - this took me far too long to figure out.
- If you read the docs you'll see that there are many more transitions
and you can mix and match them on a page.
- You might have to upgrade your emacs packages. If you
**list-packages**  in eamcs it will tell you if you have packages to
upgrade. You mark them for upgrading by typing **U** and then do the
upgrade with **x**. If this doesn't work, you can try getting rid fo
the **elpa** folder and then re-installing.
- The [[http://github.com/zamansky/mazelesson][mazelesson]] sample presentation shows more features, many that we
haven't covered yet. Check it out but remember that it's for an
earlier version of org-reveal.
- Github pages and rawgit are cool.



Hope you enjoy this. Please add any reveal.js tips and tricks of your
own.
