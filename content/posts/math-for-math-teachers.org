title: "Math For Math Teachers - watering down CS Ed before we even start"

Last Thursday I attended an event - the release of "Priming the
Computer Science Teacher Pump: Integrating CS Education into Schools
of Ed." [[https://twitter.com/guzdial][Mark Guzdial]] wrote about it [[https://computinged.wordpress.com/2018/04/16/finding-a-home-for-cs-ed-in-schools-of-ed-priming-the-cs-teacher-pump-report-released/][here]]. You can also download the
actual report [[http://www.computingteacher.org/][here]].

I agree with a number of the challenges in creating CS teacher
preparation programs that were outlined in the report and I also agree
with the idea that a strong CS teacher preparation program should
prepare teachers to teach any (and in the case of the programs I
designed, create new) curriculum but I wanted to focus on one specific
item that was brought up last Thursday. The item deals with how much
CS content a K12 CS teacher actually needs.

The speaker at the event - I forget which one pointed out that a K12
CS teacher doesn't need the same content knowledge as a full CS major
let alone graduate student. This is something I wholeheartedly agree
with. The speakers throughout the event also emphasized that CS
teachers need enough content knowledge to be "generalists" and teach
any reasonable CS experience. Again, a point on which I agree.

The point that concerned me - not in terms of the presenters intent
but rather in how I feel things will play out was when the presenter
said something to the affect (and I'm paraphrasing here):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Math teachers don't need the same level of math content knowledge as
math majors. That's why we have "math for math teachers."
#+END_QUOTE

I was immediately reminded of a conversation I had once with a
colleague. He was looking over a student's college transcript and
noticed a course "Math for Math Teachers" and thought, "I always
thought that it was just math!!!!!"

To many teachers, titles like "Calculus for Math Teachers" like
those similar courses "Calculus for Poets" or, the famous "Math
for Trees" are code for watered down math for non-math majors courses. From what I can
gather many of these courses are more Math Ed courses than Math but
offered through a school's Mathematics Department rather than through
an Ed school or department. They make sure that candidates  fill the "enough graduate
math credits" bucket. Everyone goes along with a nod and a wink and
life moves on. I want to emphasize that there's nothing inherently bad
with many of these courses - many are quite good but they're content
heavy education courses masquerading as pure content courses.

I managed to avoid doing any of that in my programs current design but
I did have to add a graduate algorithms class that I'm not entirely
happy with - I feel that it's requiring a level of depth that K12 CS
teachers will never  need.

Across all subject areas we should just acknowledge that K12 teachers
don't need a huge amount of graduate subject area credits. In my view,
teachers need depth a bit beyond the most advanced core course their
students will take and a good deal of breadth. Wouldn't it be nice if
we didn't have to play this song and dance this dance of creating
"special" subject courses for teachers.

The real thing to watch out for is how this is already playing out in
computer science. Colleges are starting to offer classes for K12
computer science teachers. I've seen a few course descriptions and
syllabi and spoken to a number of people involved with some of these
classes. It's typical to see something like "Java Programming for CS
Teachers" as opposed to a "first in CS sequence programming course
using Java." Look  under the hood and you'll find it's really "APCS-A
for teachers" - not creating a generalist teacher but rather  taking
us right back to preparing them to ape specific curricula and
sequences.

We can do better.
