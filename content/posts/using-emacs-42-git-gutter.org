One day I'll do a Magit video but since there are already some good
ones out there I thought I'd share a couple of other great git related
packages.

The first is [[https://github.com/syohex/emacs-git-gutter/tree/00c05264af046b5ce248e5b0bc42f117d9c27a09][Git Gutter]] which adds markers on the side gutter of your
buffer so you know what's changed since you're last commit. I pretty
much use it exclusively for that visual but it can also be used to
cmmit and revert individual chunks of your changes.

The second is [[https://github.com/pidu/git-timemachine][Git Timemachine]] which lets you move forward and back
between commits.

The video demos both.

Enjoy
