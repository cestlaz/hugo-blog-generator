Next weekend I'll be attending the Computer Science Teachers
Association's [[https://www.csteachers.org/general/custom.asp?page=2018Conference][annual conference.]] It's probably the biggest conference
focussed on K12 Computer Science education. This year, in addition to
attending, I'll be giving a talk on preservice and inservice CS
teacher preparation programs. I'll be talking about the new New York
State certification requirements along with what we're rolling out at
Hunter College.

This means putting together a slide deck for the session. When I have
to work collaboratively with non-Emacs users, I will usually go to
Google Docs for presentations. It works and the collaborative aspects
are nice but tools like Google Docs and Powerpoint are designed around
composing slides manually. I much prefer to use a tool where I can
focus on writing my presentation and have the tool turn it into a
presentation.

Org-mode is of course the ideal tool. As an outliner, it lends itself
to organizing a talk:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
{{< highlight "org" >}}
,* topic 1
the content for slide one
,* topic 2
the content for slide two
,* topic 3
etc.
{{< / highlight >}}
#+END_SRC

I can embed code, tables, images, and more. I can also cycle
visibility so I can focus on individual sections. Org-mode also has a
number of export options to take a plain org file which is just ascii
with markup and export it as a presentation. In the video, I'll take a
quick look at ~ox-beamer~, which exports to a Beamer presentation in LaTeX and then a PDF,
~epresent~ which presents right in Emacs and finally ~ox-reveal~ wich
creates a ~reveal.js~ presentation. I ultimately decide to continue to
use ~ox-reveal~ as it's pretty simple and flexible and I can also directly serve
the final presentation from my own laptop, a usb drive, or directly
from GitHub.

Check out the video to see how. If you want more information on using
~ox-reveal~ check out my earlier [[http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-11-reveal][Using Emacs post and video]].
