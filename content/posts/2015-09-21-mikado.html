I was brought up on Gilberg and Sullvan. My father, who always wanted
to be an opera singer sang with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Opera_of_Manhattan">LOOM</a> back in the day and there was
always classical music playing. Either from the Hi Fi or my father
singing.
</p>

<p>
Recently, there's been a kerfufle over what was to be <a href="http://nygasp.org">NYGASP's</a>
production of Mikado.
</p>

<p>
My son, Natan wrote a terrific blog post on it and the suspension of
belief in opera. It's long but well worth a read.

<p>
If you like G&amp;S or opera in general, take a look.
