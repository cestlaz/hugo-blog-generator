Day two introduced some staples of staples of not only Advent of Code but
also of programming problems in general. The first is input
parsing. For this problem you get lines of input like this:

#+begin_example
1-3 a: abcde
1-3 b: cdefg
2-9 c: cccccccc
#+end_example

or in general

*number_1*-*number_2* *Letter*: *String* 

There are a few ways to handle this. One is to brute force it. In
Python maybe something like: 

{{< highlight python >}}
sample_line="4-15 f: abcdefg"
sample_list = sample_line.split()
numbers=sample_list[0]
letter=sample_list[1]
string=sample_list[2]

number_list = numbers.split('-')
num1 = int(number_list[0])
num2 = int(number_list[1])

letter = letter[0]

print(num1, num2, letter, string)

{{</highlight>}}

or more concisely: 

{{< highlight python >}}
sample_line="4-15 f: abcdefg"

(numbers,letter,string) = sample_line.split()

(num1,num2) = [int(x) for x in numbers.split('-')]

letter = letter[0]

print(num1, num2, letter, string)
{{</highlight>}}

If you're working in a language like C, tools like ~scanf~ can make
things easier. I generally turn to [[https://blog.usejournal.com/regular-expressions-a-complete-beginners-tutorial-c7327b9fd8eb][Regular Expressions]] and if you're
doing some AOC with your classes this is a great time to introduce
regex. Basically, you set up a pattern with special symbols to
represent things like sequences of digits and then the regex matcher
does the hard work.

Here's the code to 


{{< highlight python "linenos=true" >}}
parser_expression= "(\d+)-(\d+) ([a-z]): ([a-z]*)"
data = []
for line in open("../data/day02.dat").readlines():
    x = re.search(parser_expression,line)
    (mini,maxi,letter,password) = x.groups()
    mini = int(mini)
    maxi = int(maxi)
    data.append([mini,maxi,letter,password])
{{</highlight>}}

The ~parser_expression~ in line 1 is the regular expression. Each
section in parentheses is a "group" or a pattern that will be
extracted. The *\d* for instance means a digit and the *+* adger it
means 1 or more digits so basically that will match any positive
integer. The *[a-z]* matches a single character and the *after the
final character match means zero or more of them. Once you know
regular expressions, parsing lines like this becomes very easy. The
only thing that made the above code messy at all was that I wanted to
convert the two numbers into integers rather than leave them as
strings. 

There are a couple of things worth thinking about here. First is know
your libraries. If you know regex the parsing is basically all
done. If not, you have a bit of work. On the other hand, you're
probably not going to ever have to parse input exactly like this again
so it doesn't make sense writing a super robust set of  parsing
functions tied in with this data specification. That's the second
thing. Learning what to leave as building blocks and what to write
into libraries of your own. It's most definitely worth writing a set
of routines that can be reused. Maybe something to parse dates in a
standard format would be an example. On the other hand, it's also
worth knowing when you probably won't be able to reuse things or when
generalizing to a library or set of functions you have to spend too
much time on a hundred options to make in general purpose.

Now, part 1 of the problem itself is nice because there are a lot of
ways to do it. You could loop through the password and count the
number of times a letter occurs: 

{{<highlight python>}}
count = 0
for letter in password:
    if letter == what_im_looking_for:
        count = count + 1
{{</highlight>}}

or with a list comprehension ~count = [x for x in password if x ==
waht_im_looking_for ]~.

You could be more general and build a hash table of counts and then
pull what you want: 


{{<highlight python>}}
def frequencies(word):
    d={}
    for letter in word:
        d.setdefault(letter,0)
        d[letter]=d[letter]+1
    return d
{{</highlight>}}



This is admittedly overkill for the problem but one might need this
for part 2. I coded my original solution in Clojure and Clojure has a
function that does this in one shot: ~frequencies~ so I just used that
and pulled the letter I needed.



Once you have the count, it's simple enough to see if it's in the
range.




Part 2 should have been easy but for me it was a lesson in
reading. You had to pull characters from the password at two specific
indices and see if one or the other, but not both were the letter in
question. Basically an xor. The first mistake one could make has to do
with the indexing and the second in using a regular or which students
will be more familiar with. 

My mistake is that I misread the question as requiring that you have
one instance of the letter within the *range* from the low index to
the high index not one instance at either of those two points Needless
to say, lots of wasted time and feeling silly. 

So that's day 2. The question is very approachable for APCS-A  and I'd
say even CS0 students. The interesting part to teach would be dealing
with the input, regular expressions, and how much to generalize into
utility functions when writing code over time.

Hope to have time to solve and write up more of these but getting to
crunch time in the semester.
