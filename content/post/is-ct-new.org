In a talk Mark gave last year, he also talked about "historical
thinking" and other "thinkings."

This relates to something I've thought for a long time about CS and
computational thinking in the early grades. Computational Thinking,
whatever that actually is seems to be the route that CS is taking in
the early grades. Young students aren't going to be coding up
quicksorts and many elementary schools don't have the hardware
resources needed anyway. Still, by approaching things through the CT
lens maybe we can lay down a foundation for the future. Along the way,
maybe some of these CT ideas can support students as they explore
other subject areas. 

This is all old ground for CT but what's this new opportunity?


Well, as it turns out, some of what we'd now consider computational
thinking has been going on in elementary schools for years. It's been
going on under the guise of "logic," "problem solving," and other
headings. More often than not, teachers in better resourced schools
where there there is less standardized test pressure, teachers can
spend time on these. There are also CT concepts like pattern matching
and abstraction that are present in elementary school lessons but not
necessarily labeled as such.

Maybe computational thinking isn't all brand new. Maybe we're
rebranding some ideas from other "thinkings." Problem solving and
logic belong to many fields. This is all okay. All
those other "thinkings" are in established fields. The way we do
history, math, science, etc. in our schools is well established and
it's left us, in many cases, with a tale of two cities. The haves and
the have nots.

Now we have CS and CT and all the related buzz. Even if the CT we can
do in elementary schools isn't new, even if it overlaps with
historical thinking or the others, we now have a new opportunity to
change up how we do things in the early grades and maybe we can reduce
the distance between those have and have nots. Let's see if we can
take advantage of this opportunity.
