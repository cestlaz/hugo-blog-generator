I spent this past Saturday morning up at the Microsoft building in
Times Square. What was I doing there? [[https://twitter.com/aankit?lang=en][Aankit Patel]] invited me to check
out the professional development that he and his team organized for
the teachers involved in the assorted CSforAllNYC programs that his
office runs. 

Wow.

Lots of great things going on. I was only able to stay for a couple of
hours but I spent some time in two rooms run by [[https://www.tealsk12.org/][TEALS]], a room of [[https://bjc.berkeley.edu/][BJC]]
teachers, a group working with [[https://p5js.org][p5.js]], one doing physical computing and
a bunch more.

While there was good content all around I was really impressed with
the sense of community in many of the rooms. One of the hardest parts
of being a computer science teacher in K12 is that you're frequently
the only CS teacher in your school. That can be an awfully lonely
existence. It's hard to be the only teacher. No one to bounce lesson
ideas off of or to debrief with and if you leave your school they're
left in the lurch. 

It's simply amazing that all these NYC teachers have opportunities
like this past weekends PD and the communty it provides. 

On the other hand, teachers who are not part of city programs like
SEP or TEALS don't have these opportunities and at Hunter we're trying
to do our piece to help solve that problem.

A few months ago I wrote about our plans to roll out once a month
professional development sessions for CTLE hours specifically aimed at
teachers who are ready for the next step. Those who are already
comfortable with the first courses and student experiences. I'm
describing the sessions as being for high school teachers teaching
APCS-A, similar or beyond.

Were hosting our first session on December 13th. There will be a
couple of presentations or activities to get us started but the bulk
of the time will be about planning the rest of the sessions which will
run until the end of the school year and the hope is that we will
cover both content beyond the basics.

So, if you're a public school CS teacher in NYC (and need CTLE hours)
and you're ready for something more advanced than the usual PD
opportunities, why don't you join us. Just sign up [[https://goo.gl/forms/FJDyCx7qFec1yPjr1][here]]. Space is
limited so if we fill, we'll add you to the waitlist and we'll work on
trying to find a bigger space to acomodate more teachers.

Looking forward to getting this thing started!!!!
