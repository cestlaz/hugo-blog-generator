We used Zoom for remote classes over the summer but at this point,
I've also used [[https://codingrooms.com][Coding Rooms]], [[https://bigbluebutton.org][Big Blue Button]], and Google meet as
well. They each have their own strong points and failings but all are
limited in terms of sharing multiple cameras and screen
components. All will let you share your camera or share your screen
and when you share you screen you can either share it all or a single
window. Zoom is the only one that seems to allow for easy camera
switching but it's still pretty clunky.

Why do I want to switch cameras? Because I can't draw using a mouse or
touchpad. I've gotten myself a Wacom tablet but am still not
particularly proficient at it. 

So, I got myself one of [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TTIP40/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1][these]] to use as a document camera. It worked
but as I said, switching between the webcam and document camera was
clunky at best.

OBS to the rescue!!!!!

[[https://obsproject.com/][OBS]] Studio is the [[https://obsproject.com/][Open Broadcaster Software]]. It's a cross platform
streaming studio. You can set up any number of devices and then
compose them into scenes. I use it for recording my [[https://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs][Emacs]] videos. It's
easy to set up devices for every camera you own plus monitors and
individual windows. It only took a minute or so to set up a scene with
me in the corner and my desktop: 

#+begin_export html
<img src="/img/obs/desktop.png">
#+end_export

One for my document camera: 

#+begin_export html
<img src="/img/obs/doccam.png">
#+end_export

And one for my desktop with the doccam overlayed.

#+begin_export html
<img src="/img/obs/mixed.png">
#+end_export

I can switch between them by clicking on which I want. I can also
select a transition like fade. 

This is all great for recording or streaming to a service like Twitch
but what about using with meeting software? It turns out that you can
set up OBS to act as a virtual camera. There are plugins for Mac and
Windows. You can find them by searching for them but for Linux, I
followed this video and it worked perfectly: 

#+begin_export html
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eca509IDLdM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
#+end_export

I also found this video if the above one doesn't work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJSkj-dLoI

I set up the virtual camera as per the video and then selected it as
the camera on both Zoom and Coding Rooms and it worked perfectly. It
should work on the other platforms as well. 

This is HUGE. Now, instead of explicitly sharing my screen I can hacve
my screen as my image and quickly and easily switch over to another
window, a document camera or anything else. 

If you're teaching remotely using a conferencing platform I recommend
you check this out.
