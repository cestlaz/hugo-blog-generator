I've got some CS Ed stuff I want to write but can't bring myself to
writing about it today. I rarely post outside of my wheelhouse - CS,
Education and the intersection of the two.

I don't really think I'm qualified to say much about the current
crisis. The out of control police, racism, class warfare, a failed
government not only at the federal level but also in New York city and
state but maybe I can share something worthwhile from my narrow
experiences.

I've been seeing too many posts and tweets about the protests
condemning any rioting. I've never promoted violence but still I
thought I might have something to say.

The important background piece is that for those of us who are white
and who grew up with some level if privilege, it's hard for us to
really understand the what oppressed people suffer.  

I started life in a somewhat well to do family, I attended private
school through first grade, then my parents pulled me and my
siblings out for public school - somethingn for which I'm now
grateful. Shortly after, my dad got sick, lost his job and later passed
away. That left my mom raising 3 kids on a teachers salary. On the one
hand we had the apartment, on the other I wore hand-me-downs. I worked
my way through school and payed "rent" living at home not because I
wanted to but because we needed me to. So, we weren't well to do but
although I didn't realize it at the time, I possessed great privilege
both in terms of my skin color and also in terms of what my mom was
willing and more importantly able to sacrifice of herself for her
children. 

As I got older my schools, though public were less reflective of
society. Populations were pretty diverse but I was brought up in
something of an intellectual bubble and under the belief it was a
meritocracy.

After school and a stint on Wall street, I went to teach at Seward
Park. What an awakening. It was my first exposure to kids and families
living under far harsher circumstances than I. When I was a kid I
volunteered at a soup kitchen. I couldn't reconcile the family that on
the one hand had to come to the kitchen for food while the family all
wore really expensive sneakers (I was wearing the $10 Alexander's
special). As I got more exposed to "how the other half lived" I
learned that it was more complex. 

While I went into teaching on a whim, as my career progressed I
realized more and more how important public education was and the job
became more of a mission. At the same time, as I learned more and more
about the populations that I tried to serve so that I could support them
and try to really know their circumstances. I realized that it's really
hard to "get it." I also realized that the more removed you are, the
higher up you are on the ladder, the harder it is. That's not to say
that there aren't many well to do people with huge hearts trying to
and doing good it's just that I feel that the further you are from the
ground floor the harder it is to really understand the issues that the
ground floor people have to live with.

So, this brings us back to the protests and the rioting. 

Separating out the protesters and rioters we really have 4 types of
rioters:

 1. Criminals - people who are going to riot and loot whenever the
    opportunity presents itself. Remember Philly after the Eagles won
    the Superbowl?  These people are just criminals.
 2. Riots resulting from police instigators - well, we should condemn
    the police and not their victims and we've seen a bunch of video
    evidence of this.
 3. Riots resulting from white agitatos - same as the previous point. 
 4. Riots from within the protest group.

That last group - group 4 are the only ones who are part of the
protest groups but let's not be so fast to condemn them. It's easy for
those of us of privilege to point fingers and say "shame on you,
protest peacefully" but where has that gotten them? We were talking
about this earlier and I was trying to remember an earlier victim of
police brutality. I was thinking of Rodney King 20 years ago but was
blanking on the name. Devorah rattled off names walking back the
years. Two decades, countless abuses and nothing changed with
peaceful protest. There comes a time when you feel you're out of
options. It's easy for us to point and condemn but very hard to
understand. 

Am I promoting violence? No. I feel bad about innocents hurt and small
business owners who's property has been damaged but what about the
lives that have been lost or destroyed due to police abuse and
government inaction and in fact government support?

There are solutions. [[https://www.joincampaignzero.org/#vision][Campaign Zero]] has a lot of info on how to reform
policing. We also have to fully fund schools and actually deal with
poverty rather than make it a crime.

I don't have any inspirational message here or any real answers. The
work goes on. I'll continue my work in public education try to support
my students and understand them and there challenges more and more and
try to be a better ally to those less privileged than I.
