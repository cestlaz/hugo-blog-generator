I haven't been blogging much this year. Not sure why - probably pandemic
fatigue. It's also affected my blog reading - more scanning, less deep
reading. I've also been trying to spend mode time off screen learning
how to paint (with,let's say  mixed results :-) ) leaving less time
and energy to blog. Hopefully I'll pick up on both ends as more people
get vaccinated and we can get to a more normal life. 

In any event, I tried a new motivation for Quicksort today so I
thought I'd share.

I've approached teaching the Quicksort in a variety of ways ([[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/try-something-new/][here]],
[[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/quick-sort-starting/][here]], [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2010-03-14-sorting-from-top-and-from-bottom/][here]], [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-03-12-select-to-sort/][here]]) but never had a great lead in activity. Merge sort
was easy in person since you can "Tom Sawyer" [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-02-27-dumbass/][shuffling a deck of
cards]] in class. We adapted this activity pretty well to [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/merge-over-zoom/][work over Zoom]]
this past summer in our teacher certification program. Quicksort
however, haven't found a good one. 

Thinking about how to leverage remote, I had an idea to try - use
polls. I use [[https://zulip.com/][Zulip]] for class discussions. It's like Slack but is open
source, can be self hosted, you can post from email,  and has much
better threading. I wrote a small bot to quickly create emoji
polls. 

First I asked for the students to share their birtdays - just month
and day in the form MMDD so if you were born on March 12th you would
write 0312 in the chat. 

Then, I picked one birthday at random, let's say 0515. 

I then created a poll: 

#+begin_quote
:dog: My birthday is earlier in the year than 0515

:cat: My birthday is later in the year than 0515
#+end_quote

The bot tags the post with the emoji and the class can click on their
choice. 

We then talk about what we now know - 

1. We now know the exact location of 0515 with respect to all the
   dates
2. The data set is now partially ordered (everything less than 0515 to
   the left, greater to the right).

I also drew out some diagrams showing what was happening 

This is also one iteration of the Quicksort. 


We do this again on one side and continue to discuss. 

From here we finish developing the algorithm and we're off to the
races.

As usual, I won't know for a while how well this worked or if it did
at all but the students seemed to be engaged and so far I think it
helped get a good feel for how the algorithm worked. 

Using Zulip or other chat polls in this case made the motivating
activity easy and seamless. I'm not sure that this particular activity
would be as easy to implement in person unless you used some
technology like clickers. 

We finished off the class discussing how we should test our
implementations. They're going to test the sorts on a variety of data
sets including sets where all values are the same or are already
sorted. Given our naive pivot selection this should lead to some
pretty bad runtimes -- fodder to motivate the next class.
