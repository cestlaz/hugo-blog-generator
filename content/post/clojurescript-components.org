I got some positive feedback from my first Clojurescript [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-63-clojurescript/][post and
video]] so I thought I'd continue with the series.

Here we'll continue to build a simple
Clojurescript/Shadow-cljs/Reagent/Tailwindcss application by creating
some reusable components. It's one of the things that make
Clojurescript so nice for web development. 

Here's a link to the GitHub repo with the code:
