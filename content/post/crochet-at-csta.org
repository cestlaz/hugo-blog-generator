Ok, probably more knitting but Crochet at CSTA was the line used in
the newsletter and it sounds better.

As some of you know, my wife Devorah is all about the fiber
arts. Knitting, spinning, dying, weaving, the works. We've got a loom,
two spinning wheels, two bobbin lace pillows, and bins and bins of
deconstructed sheep, llamas, alpacas, and angora bunnies. I even got
her some straw once to spin into gold. I
figured as teachers it would be a good retirement plan.  That never
happened.

At one point at a conference we attended, Devorah noted that she
wasn't the only one knitting and an [[http://blanketstatementproject.com/][idea]] was born. She encouraged
knitters and crocheters to make 7x9 blocks and at the end of the
conference she put it together into a blanket a it was donated to
[[https://www.projectlinus.org/][Project Linus]] who got the blanket to a child in distress.

You can read up about how this all went down [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/knitting-tech-conference/][here]] and [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/catskills-blanket-2018/][here]]. 

Now, thanks to the CSTA and [[https://twitter.com/jakebask][Jake Baskin ]]in particular along with the
[[https://twitter.com/GitHubEducation][GitHub Education]] team led by [[https://twitter.com/mohardek][Moira Hardek]] we're bringing [[http://blanketstatementproject.com/][Blanket
Statement]] to CSTA-2019. 

If you knit or crochet, swing by the GitHub booth, grab a ball of yarn and
some needles (or a crochet hook) and knit away. Bring completed blocks
back to Devorah at the booth. 

Don't know how to knit or crochet? No problem. Devorah will teach
you. She'll be at the GitHub booth for the entire conference.

In addition to all the amazing CS that were all going to do during the
conference, let's go old school and knit a blanket or two for charity.
