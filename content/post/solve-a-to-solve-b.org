So many programming assignments involve a direct solution. Write a
program to do this or write a problem to solve that. It's pretty
typical. There's nothing wrong with assignments like these. They allow
students to practice what they've been learning and it gives them the
opportunity to create some cool programs. All the same, I like it when
there's an indirect problem. You're faced with a problem but in order
to solve it you first have to solve some other problem

That's why I liked [[https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/10][day 10]] from this year's Advent of Code. 

At it's core the question presents you with a collection of points
along with velocities in this form::

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
position=< 9,  1> velocity=< 0,  2>
position=< 7,  0> velocity=<-1,  0>
position=< 3, -2> velocity=<-1,  1>
position=< 6, 10> velocity=<-2, -1>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Each point moves by adding the x and y components if its velocity each
second. For example, the last two points listed above - points (3,-2)
nad (6,10) would be transformed overtime as follows:

| Point | Velocity | Second 0 | Second 1 | Second 2 | Second 3 | Second 4 |
|-------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------|
| 3, -2 | -1,1     | 3,-2     | 2,-1     | 1,0      | 0,1      | -1,2     |
| 6,10  | -2,-1    | 6,10     | 4,9      | 2,8      | 0,7      | -2 6     |

At some point in time, if you look at the points on a grid they will
spell out a message or at least a sequence of letters. The question
asks you to figure out that message. There's a complete example and a
nice story around the problem on the [[https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/10][Advent of Code site]]. 

The first thought is probably to run this as a simulation. Set up a
loop, update the point locations, visualize and see if you have an
answer. This isn't trivial for a beginner but it's certainly
approachable. It also has a big problem. Unless you happen to have
some optical character recognition libaray handy you have to draw and
look at the output on every change. Given that it could take thousands
of iterations, this is not practical at all. 

We can do better by solving another problem first. The key insight is
that each point travels along a line. In fact, this problem is a great
time to talk about a parametric representation of a line like 

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML">
</script>

\(L=P+tV\) 

Where \(P\)represents an \((x,y)\) point and \(V\) a direction vector
\((dx,dy)\).

Regardless of where the points start, at some point all of them will
be contained within your field of view after which they will continue
along their paths outside of that field of view. We can look at a
bounding box for all of the points and when that bounding box is
smallest we should be at or close to our message.

This is readily accomplished. We can find a bounding box by finding the
smallest and largest x and y coordinates for all the current points
and using \((X_{min},Y_{min})\) and \((X_{max},Y_{max})\) as the
diagonals of a bounding rectangle and then compare areas of these
rectangles. They should decrease at first and then eventually
increase. 

{{< highlight python >}}
  for time = range(0,some_large_value,stepsize):
      new_pts = transform(pts,time) 
      bbox = bounding_box(new_pts)
      if (area(bbox) > area(previous_bbox)):
          break // we're close to or at the smallest bounding box
{{< /highlight >}}

We can start with a big ~stepsize~ and then refine it down until we
hone in on the smallest bounding box.

From there, we can transform all the points using the time that
resulted in the smallest bounding box and then display the points to
see our message. We might have to go through a small window of times
since the actual message might just be close to the configuration
yielded from the smallest bounding box. Of course that visualization
takes some doing - the actual viewing window might not align with your
screeen coordinates, they could all, for example, be negative so
you'll probably have to do one last transformation to translate and
possibly scale the final points to make it all viewable.

When I first solved the problem, I just dumped the coordinates into a
2 dimentional array and printed it but afterwards I wrote a little
clojurescript html5 canvas visualization:

{{< figure height="20px" width="200px" src="/img/advent-2018-10.gif"
>}}

So there it is. It's not a trivial problem for beginners but it is doable. There's a
lot to deal with:

1. parse the data


This isn't too bad. You could cover regular expressions but even
without it isn't too big of a deal. You could also just use an editor
to extract the important data or preprocess this for the kids.

2. Figure out how to transform the points.

This also isn't too bad. Just loop over all the points with ~newpoint
= oldpoint + t * velocity~

3. Figure out the bounding boxes

Also not too bad. Loop over all the points to find the smallest and
largest x and y coordinates

4. Set up a loop to find the smallest bounding box and hence the time
   that the message will appear.

and then finally:

5. draw the points to visually inspect the answer.

This might be the most persnickety part. When I first coded it my
output was upside down and backwards but good enough.

I can't fully put my finger on it but I really enjoyed this problem. I
hope you enjoyed my writeup. If you want to check out my solution for
this (minus the clojurescript visualization) along with the other
Advent of Code problems I finished this year you can find them [[https://github.com/zamansky/advent2018][here]].
