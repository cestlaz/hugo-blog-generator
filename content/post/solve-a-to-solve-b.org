So many programming assignments involve a direct solution. Write a
program to do this or write a problem to solve that. It's pretty
typical. That's why I love it when I find a problem that's 

position=< 9,  1> velocity=< 0,  2>
position=< 7,  0> velocity=<-1,  0>
position=< 3, -2> velocity=<-1,  1>
position=< 6, 10> velocity=<-2, -1>
