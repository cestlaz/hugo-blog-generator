I thought I'd do a video for today. No particular reason. Mostly why
not.

I'll talk about day 3's problem and code up a solution in Clojure. If
you haven't ever used Clojure, hopefully this will give a bit of the
flavor. This video also serves double duty as being my next Using
Emacs video since it demos Emacs's Clojure tools. Mostly Cider which
even with a few quirks is the best development environment I've ever
used. 

I don't know if I'll do any more videos or blog posts on AOC this
year. I hope to but I'm going to have to get to end of semester
obligations soon so you never know.

Enjoy!
