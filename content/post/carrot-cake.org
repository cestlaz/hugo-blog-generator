Not my normal post but these are not normal times. Besides, this isn't
the first [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2010-05-02-flatbreads.html/][recipe]] I've posted. 

I'm one of those that will, as long as supplies allow, bake and cook
my way through our shelter in. Today I made Brazilian carrot
cake. It's not quite the same as an American carrot cake as you'll see
from the recipe below. 

First, carrot cake rules:


Obviously since it contains carrot which is a vegetable, it's healthy.

If you don't ice it and serve it before evening, it's carrot bread and
therefore a healthy option for breakfast, brunch, or snack.

Only when you add the frosting or icing does it become carrot cake and
hence dessert. 

This recipe is the family recipe of one of my daughter's coworkers. I
can only imagine it's from some Brazilian grandmother and hence the
measurement of "3 large carrots." It makes me think of recipes that
I'd get from bubbe or my mothers bubbe - "add 2 cups of sugar." Of
course she was talking about 2 empty yartzeit glasses of sugar. I have
a relative who followed around here grandmother an before she added
any ingredient for a recipe put it in a standard measure to 
convert the recipe to something that we could make sense of today.

Okay, now on to the recipe:

* Ingredients
** Cake

- 3 carrots, peeled and sliced)
- 3 eggs (large)
- 1 cup oil
- 2 cups sugar
- 2 cups flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder

** Brigadeiro sauce

- 1 can sweetened condensed milk
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 4 tablespoons of cocoa (or use some other chocolate and melt it in)

** Buttermilk Glaze

I sometimes use this instead of the brigadeiro sauce
- 2/3 cups buttermilk
- 1 to 2 cups powdered sugar

* Directions
** Cake

Preheat oven to 350
Prepare pan (I line the bottom with parchment and grease)

- Mix sugar, flour, baking powder in a bowl
- Blend carrots in a blender
- Add oil and eggs to blender and blend all together
- Fold carrot mixture into dry ingredients
- pour into prepared pan
- bake for ~40 mintues

** Bigadeiro sauce (if using) 

- combine all ingredients in saucepan
- cook, stirring until thickened (about 10 minutes) 

  You'll know it's thick enough when you drag your spoon across the
  pan and you can see the bottom. It will thicken up considerably when
  it cools so better if it's looser rather than thicker.

  spread on cake while warm.

** Buttermilk glaze (if using)

- whisk together glaze ingredients until smooth.
- poke holes all over cake with a fork or knife
- pour / spread glaze on cake
