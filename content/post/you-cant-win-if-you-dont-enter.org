Or, as Wayne Gretzky said "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."

Why do I mention this? 

Because I've been hearing way too often from young people who are too
quick to deny themselves opportunities and too often these are
students who have come from less advantaged backgrounds.

It's Fall and I've been making my rounds visiting local schools to
talk to seniors about colleges in general and Hunter CS in
particular. I end the talk going over my Daedalus program which is
Hunter's honors CS scholarship program.

Since starting my "Fall tour" I've hard from too many students both in
person and via email - "I don't think I have the grades for," "I'll
never make it in," "It's a waste of time for me to apply." They might
be talking about my program or they might be talking about some other
college. Sometimes the students would indeed have less than a punchers
chance to get in but other times their academic portfolio would
certainly get their foot in the door. In all cases it made me sad that
these students were denying themselves possible opportunities.
