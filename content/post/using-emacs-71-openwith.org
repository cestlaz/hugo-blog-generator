I spend most of my time in Emacs but still use the shell and browser
for some things. One of the things I use my shell for is to launch
libreoffice to view and edit docx files and spreadsheets, evince for
pdf files and imagemagick for image files. Yes, I know I can view all
of these in Emacs but there are a few limitations:

1. Emacs chokes on large files
2. I can't edit the docx file or the image

So, I hop to the shell and launch the program I need on the files in
question. It's fine but it does mean I end up with two windows for
each operation - the terminal from which I run, say, libreoffice and
libreoffice itself. I will also have my browser and one ore more Emacs
windows open so things can get a bit cluttered.

Now, on the Emacs side, one tool that I still haven't gotten myself to
regularly use is dired. I figured dired could be made to do what I
want - quickly and easily launch programs to view and edit my files.

By default, dired opens files in a new Emacs buffer. That's fine for
text files but not the behavior I want for docx and other files. It
turns out there are a number of good solutions. The one that I'll
likely stick with is [[https://github.com/jpkotta/openwith/tree/1dc89670822966fab6e656f6519fdd7f01e8301a][openwith]] but there are other options as
well. Check out the video for more:
