A teacher in one of my networks posted a question earlier today -
"have you had any challenges or trouble with motivating kids in your
classes?"

Not a new question and  I'm sure for any teacher with any level of
experience the answer is a resounding *yes*. I don't care who you
are. Not all of your students are motivated all the time.

This can particularly be a problem when a teacher switches over from
teaching an elective or selective to a required class but it might not
be. I had to deal with this when I was able to get Stuy to require the
intro course I designed. It was an adjustment but not really too big a
deal. If anything, more students ended up getting turned on to CS than
turned off and since even as an elective, there were always some
unmotivated students. The adjustment was overcoming the reticence of
students being "forced" to be there as opposed to students who might
have taken an elective for the wrong reasons.

Anyway, back to the problem.

CS can be many things but in K12 it frequently involves programming
and since that was what the initial question was referring to, we'll
stick to that.

Some students will be motivated by programming in and of
itself. They might see it as a creative art. That's great but they're
the easy ones.

Beyond that, programming is usually used for one of two
things. Solving problems and/or building things. You could also add
for telling stories or communicating ideas but you might put those
under building things.

Looking at programming through those lenses can also motivate more
students.

From there, we get to the fine tuning.

What will scratch a student's itch. They might not care for coding but
they might have some problem they want to solve of thing they want to
build. When I was very young and just teaching myself to program I was
of an age when a favored pastime was making fun of your friend's
mother. So, what did my clique do? We wrote "The Mother Game" - a
stupid little program to insult each others moms. True, we were
already motivated since we were teaching ourselves but we went much
farther doing that silly game than if we were solving some textbook
problem.

Sometimes collaboration can help. Of friends and I who wroet "The
Mother Game," two of us were techies but one wasn't but the third got
caught up in the group activity.

Of course we still have to remember that one size will not fit
all. Something that motivates student A might not motivate student B
and what motivates the teacher will almost certainly not motivate
everyone in class (I'm looking at you, gamification people). Sure,
games are fun for some but not everyone. Same with sports, current
events, fashion and any other topic. As a teacher you can mix it up
and give individual choice when possible and all of that can help.

One thing to remember though is that even when we're having trouble
motivating all of our students we still have it much easier in that
regard than many other subject teachers. A language teacher is
limited by their class level's vocabulary. In math, you can solve
problems but only with the math they've learned so far which we know
rarely translates to natural motivation. I love history but many
students don't and history classes are frequently very strictly
constrained so teachers might not have the freedom they want to
motivate as many students as they could otherwise.

And of course, public school teachers with large classes will have a
*much* harder time than private school teachers who only meet with a
handful at a time.

Before closing, I should also mention that some teachers will have an
easier time than others due to their own personalities. Some teachers
are charismatic or otherwise succeed by "force of personality." It
seems that students more want to please some teachers than others and
that is also a form of motivation. I'm not saying it's a great long
term one but I do want to acknowledge it.

So, to close I also want to remind teachers that no matter what you do
you are *not* going to motivate all students and *not* all the
time. You might read facebook posts by miracle teachers who only share
successes or "thought leaders" who talk the talk but don't walk the
walk but the truth is nobody bats 1000. In baseball, you can fail at
the plate two third of the time and you're a hall of famer. Good
teachers will do better than that but as I said, nobody bats 1000. Win
as much as you can but don't beat yourself up because you can't reach
everyone all the time. Strive to do better throughout your career and
when the dust settles you'll see that your successes far outweigh the
times when you weren't as happy with your results.
