Sometimes professional practices don't work well in the classroom and
sometimes they do. One professional practice that does work well is
code review - reading and reflecting on other peoples code.

I've had my students do code reviews in the past but this time I did
things differently. Here's what I did and here's how it went

Two weeks ago my students completed a lab. The lab involved reading
in a poorly indented C++ program and spit out a properly indented
one. This was the platform for the reviews.

First we paired everyone off. They forked each others labs and then
did a code review on each others assignment. Each student would read
their partner's code, decide what to focus on - the whole thing, a
single function or something in between, and write up a code
review. They couldn't talk during this process. 

I was intentionally a little vague in the details of the assignment.

Afterwards, each student got a new partner and we did the review again
but this time one student would review the other's code and they would
talk through the process while they took notes. 

Next, we changed pairs a third time and this time the student that did
the talking review last time got their code reviewed in the same way.

Finally, we repeated the whole thing again.

This left each student with four code reviews. Two done in silence and
two that were interactive.

This took the entire hour fifteen of class so we didn't get to discuss
the review until the following week.

The first thing I asked when we debriefed was which review was more
valuable? The written or the interactive one. They universally liked the
latter. This led to a spin-off discussion on pair programming. I love
pair programming as a pedagogical tool but students don't always buy
all in. Some don't communicate as much as the should and don't get as
much value out of the process as they could. On the other hand, they
all seemed to see the value in the interactive code review but if you
think about it, pair programming is really a real time interactive
code review. I'm hoping this process helps with pair programming buy
in. I think it will.

Next we talked about takeaways from all their reviews. There were good
comments on, well, commenting, also on function length. This led to
talk about self commenting code, good variable and function names,
style guides, function header comments and all sorts
of good coding stuff.

All this was great but I think more than the recap, the reviews
themselves might have had the greatest impact.

One student commented that he found the code he reviewed much easier
to read and understand that his own code because it did indeed use
better function and variable names and was better laid out and
commented. 

Another student noted that for a couple of programs he reviewed he had
a hard time understanding what the programmer was doing. During the
interactive review it was apparent that the author also no longer
understood their own code. I think that, at least for these students,
it really drove home the idea of writing good code. We talked about
how the real world would be different. In class they work on a project
in a concentrated short period of time. In the real world, they'll be
working on multiple projects or at least multiple segments of projects
on and off over a long period of time. Remembering your own code is
super critical.

Overall, I'm very happy with the way these lessons played out. I
already thought that the actual code reviews had value but doing it
this way led to more student discovery some great discussions and
reflections. I think it was a big win.
