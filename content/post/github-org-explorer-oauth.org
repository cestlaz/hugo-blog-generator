A while ago I wrote about a small side project - [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/github-org-explorer/][GitHub Org Explorer]] -
a small tool to make it easier to manager GitHub repositories based on
organization. I'm using it as a replacement for the GitHub provided
Classroom Assistant. I find it more flexible in terms of exporting
assignments to my own machine and it allows me to delete repos en
masse which is critical after the semester is over.

Shortly after I released it I found that GitHub was going to sunset
the basic authentication I was using so I had to convert the
application to support oauth.

So, here it is. 

Along the way I had a few headaches. I wrote about them [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/my-code-works/][here]]. Mostly
versioning issues surrounding the node ecosystem. I still haven't
figured it all out but I think I've gotten everything working
alright. 


If you want to check it out, you can grab it off GitHub. Here's the
repo: [[https://github.com/zamansky/github-org-explorer][https://github.com/zamansky/github-org-explorer]]. 

Here's the short runthrough video I made. Logging in looks different
but everything operates the same way:
