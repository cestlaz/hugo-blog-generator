I didn't expect to read a Fred Wilson post on [[https://avc.com/2020/03/teaching-online/][teaching online]] but
that's what I found when I visited [[https://avc.com/][his blog]] this morning. Don't get me
wrong - I suspect that Fred has the makings of a great teacher, it's
just not what I expected to find. There have been many posts about
education but I don't recall any about teaching or more specifically
the art of teaching. I did find [[https://avc.com/2011/07/teaching/][this post]] though which actually speaks
to some of the thoughts today's post got churning.

Fred describes what sounds like a typical "lecture style" lesson he's
delivered numerous times. This time, it would be delivered via
Zoom. Now, Zoom is great but it's harder to do an interactive
lecture - ie active learning online than it is to do in person which
is what I'm guessing led him to set up some starter Google sheets and
use these shared documents for an active project based class.

At the end of the post, now that he came up with what sounds like
a much stronger approach. Fred wonders if he'll ever teach this class
any other way. 

The first thing I thought was that this would be even better in
person. I don't know the specifics but I could think of a number of
ways of running this. All in person with time to work on the
spreadsheets is one. Giving some pre-work and the sheets and then pick
up somewhere in the middle is another. In person gives the feel - the
live interaction where a teacher can read the class but there's no
reason why we can't also leverage tech tools like shared Google
sheets in a live classroom.

Then I got thinking about necessity being the mother of
invention. Nothing stops us from changing things up, from trying
something in normal times but when the norm is disrupted sometimes it
spurs creativity or changes focus. I
try to continually evolve as a teacher but I'm no better than anyone
else and get caught in ruts. I force myself to try new
things. Sometimes they work and it's great and sometimes [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/try-something-new/][they
don't]]. Live and learn. On the other hand, when all if a sudden you can't do things the
usual way the brain works on alternatives. 

One example was the lesson where I
"invented" live coding. It was a direct result of a forced change -
for some reason, and I don't recall why, I couldn't do things the way I
wanted that day so I winged it. Years later, I was chatting with a
former student and he, out of the blue mentioned that that lesson had
a profound influence on him. 

Right now, I'm teaching using Zoom, slack, videos and email. Not being
in a room with my kids sucks. I feel less connected and it's much
harder to read the class. What am I doing? On the one hand, I'm not
trying to change that much at once as I want my students to have some
stability in an uncertain time but I am working on new things. The
nice thing is that whatever I come up with I can share with my fellow
teachers here and take with me back into the classroom. 

This was my big takeaway but the post also reminded me of why I turn
to teachers before I turn to "the research" or policy makers on how to
teach. Fred described the evolution of a lesson and a teaching
technique. What he essentially described is what teachers do every day
and we have to do it accounting for all the variables that the
research can't. We teach multiple classes a day every day of the
week. We try things, assess the results, rinse and repeat. I get that
all teachers don't do this but the good ones do.

The final thought I had was with the reality that while coming up with
interesting active learning experiences is great it also takes a lot
of time and there's not much time when you're teaching five classes a
day five days a week to 150 kids along with grading, advising, and
everything else. This is why I tell young teachers that you always
want to evolve and improve but not every lesson is going to be a home
run and that's okay.

It's particularly important for teachers to remember this now as
across the nation they're re-inventing their syllabi on the fly to
move from in person to online and they're doing it without time,
training, and in some cases tools. 

Do the best you can and continue to develop your toolset. Not every
new online experience will be great but if they're sincere, your kids
will know. In the end we'll all be okay and back to normal but with a
whole bunch of new tricks up our sleeves.
