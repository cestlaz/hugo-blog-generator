A big part of the CS4All movement has been making computer science
available at all grade levels. Of course that can mean many
things. Grade levels could be elementary, middle, and high school or
it can me k-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12 or maybe even every grade.

Does it mean required at every level or just an option?

This has led to many discussions and, at least from the ones I've
listened in on, the prevailing feeling from the CS side is all CS all
the time.

I don't know if this should be the case. It's important to think about
other factors - bang for your buck, budgets, student workload,
available faculty, what are the other requirements, and mode.

This question also isn't limited to computer science, or at least it
shouldn't be.

All students in NY have to complete one year of world language. You
can't get anywhere near fluent in one period a day for one school
year. Does that make sense at all? Particularly if you're just
studying the mechanics of the language and not anything about history
or culture. I don't know. Stuyvesant had a 3 year requirement. That
will get you closer to fluency but it probably won't get you
there. The Stuy requirement is also flawed because it's only there to
keep a large number of teachers in the language department. A better
requirement would be to require up to a level of expertise. If a kid
comes in bilingual, great - they can use those language slots for
other cool elective.

Now, for language, the requirement is in high school. Would it be
beneficial to require language in middle school? What about elementary
and if you do it in elementary, is it also important in middle school?
All worthwhile questions.

Physical Education is another subject worth asking about. In New York,
in HS you're supposed to have Phys Ed once a day every school day
for all four years. The problem is that, that in my experience, phys
ed classes were of minimal value. For me, it was 40 minutes a
day. Change on either side + take attendance and there's barely any
time for any physical activity.

Now, I'm very pro physical fitness - back in the late 90s I was
seriously overweight. Over time, I dropped 65 pounds and to this day
follow a much more healthy much more active lifestyle. I just don't
think the NYC phys ed class model really works. I'm also pro downtime
classes - phys ed, recess, or other classes that engage (or disengage)
students differently.

Then there's art and music - requirements are minimal as is
implementation and in my personal opinion this has been criminal.

What about CS?

We have neither the funds nor the faculty to offer CS as a requirement
in every grade but is it even necessary? I don't know. The most
important part of offering CS in K12 is so that it's on a student's
radar so they can consider studying more after HS. This is
particularly important with some colleges even requiring students
apply as a CS major before even attending.

I know that we can do it with a single class requirement and two years
of offerings. How do I know this? Because we did this at Stuy. Doing
this requires two basic things:
1. A well taught, well designed intro course that exposes students to
   the subject.
2. Covering enough material deeply enough so that students are well
   prepared for the next steps in college should a student take them.
