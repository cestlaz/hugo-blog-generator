I'm guessing that pretty much everyone who stops by this blog knows
about the [[https://csteachers.org/][CSTA]] (Computer Science Teacher's Association) and most of
you probably know about some awards they, well, award. Just in case, I
thought I'd share.

Here are three awards, two of which are open for nominations /
applications now. If you know someone deserving, nominate them. I'm
guessing students don't really know about the Cutler-Bell award so if
you have any deserving students, please share the info with them.

* Champions of CS Awards

Tell us about a student, educator, administrator, or organization that
has achieved something in computer science this past year for the
opportunity to be recognized as a 2019 Champion of Computer Science.

The Champions of Computer Science Awards identify and promote
students, teachers, administrators, and organizations who have made a
significant impact to improve access to and the quality of CS
education. These awards are presented by CSTA and Code.org.

Nominations are due Oct. 21, 2019.

* Cutler-Bell Prize

The ACM/CSTA Cutler-Bell Prize in High School Computing is a prize
designed to recognize talented high school students intending to
continue their higher education in the areas of computer science or
technology. The program seeks to promote and encourage the field of
computer science, as well as to empower young and aspiring learners to
pursue computing challenges outside of the traditional classroom
environment.

Up to four winners will be selected annually and each will be awarded
a $10,000 prize which will be administered through the financial aid
department at the university the student will attend.

Applications are due Jan. 12, 2020.

* CS Teaching Excellence Awards

The CS Teaching Excellence Awards, sponsored by CSTA and Infosys
Foundation USA, are designed to recognize outstanding teaching by Kâ€“12
computer science teachers. Winners demonstrate their excellent work
inspiring students to explore the computer science field; effectively
engage students in learning rigorous, standards-aligned, computer
science content; and a focus on broadening participation of
underrepresented students in computing.

Applications open the spring of 2020.
