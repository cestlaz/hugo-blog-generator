Over at [[https://avc.com][AVC]] Fred Wilson just posted about [[https://avc.com/2020/03/outschool-can-help-your-school-prepare-for-unexpected-closures/][Outschool's efforts]]
to support students and teachers in the event of school closures due
to the Coronavirus. All the details and relevant links are in the
post. 

I looked a bit into Outschool when Fred first [[https://avc.com/2019/05/outschooling/][wrote about them]] but
never had a chance to do a deep dive.

Now, internet based teaching is not going to be as effective as in
person teaching but I was thinking about how far things have come.

After superstorm Sandy, Stuy was closed for about a week. Instead of
losing all the time my classes and I decided to try to do us some
internet schooling. We used Google tools and things went pretty well. 

I wrote about what we did and some concluding thoughts [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2012-10-31-sandy-bridge.html/][here]] and
[[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2012-11-02-back-to-work/][here]]. 

Back then - 2012 - the technology was close but not quite there. Now,
with tools like [[https://zoom.us][Zoom]] and I'm guessing [[https://outschool.com/][Outschool]], which is probably
more fine tuned for education rather than meetings you have some nice
all in one or at least most in one solutions. I had to use a YouTube
broadcast and separate documents and chats. Today's tools tie all of
those together along with screen sharing. Maybe Outschool even has a
shared virtual blackboard - that would be pretty cool. Add in
something like Trello and GitHub and we're really cooking.

It really reminds me that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Wave][Google Wave]] was really a product ahead of
it's time. 

As I said above, internet teaching will not be as effective as
live. It's more of a show and do rather than an interactive class and
I go through some of the other issues in the my two posts linked above
but we're getting better. Certainly way better than closing a school
and doing nothing. 

Hats off to Outschool for providing their services to the community. I
hope few have to use them but am thankful they're there.
