how do we get "the research" into the teachers
hands in a practical way? And do they want it? 

My advice as a long time practitioner 

1. Don't research AT schools work WITH teachers and FOR teachers 
2. Walk the walk or give all the caveats  or give the #s and no
   judgment
   
3. Get the powers that be to stop abusing research (good or bad)
