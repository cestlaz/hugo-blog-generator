I spent yesterday at [[https://k12.tech.cornell.edu/what-we-do/to-code-and-beyond/][To Code and Beyond]], a one day conference put
together by my friend [[https://twitter.com/diane_levitt][Diane Levitt]] and her team. This year the theme
was CS Education Research as it applies to K12 education.

As usual, Diane and her team put together a great program and a great
day. Those of you who know me know that my personal relationship with
education research is, well, let's say, strained. I do believe that
there's some great work going on and I have many friends whom I both
like and respect very much who I think do great work. I also think
that that a *huge* amount of education research is, well,
questionable.

On one of the conference panels, the question came up as to how we can
get "the research" into the hands of practicing teachers for them to
use. I think this is a great question but would add "and how and when
would this be good and when would teachers rather not be burdened with
work they might find questionable."

At the risk of angering some friends, I thought I'd share my thoughts
on this today.




how do we get "the research" into the teachers
hands in a practical way? And do they want it? 

My advice as a long time practitioner 

1. Don't research AT schools work WITH teachers and FOR teachers 
Mark's stuff

get release time for teachers 

2. Walk the walk or give all the caveats  or give the #s and no
   judgment
   
3. Get the powers that be to stop abusing research (good or bad)

4. who's going to get the crap off teachers plate (including things
   like high stakes testing and CC) to make room
