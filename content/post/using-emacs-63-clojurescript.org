I've been playing with ClojureScipt for my web projects recently and
really like it. Much more fun than any of the JavaScript frameworks
I've used. 

Still, getting started was somewhat difficult due to the number of
options in tooling and uneven documentation and learning resources.

Here's a video that shows how I use Emacs for ClojureScript
development but the focus of the video is on how to get started with
ClojureScript and Emacs takes a back seat other than an example of my
workflow.

On the Clojurscript side I'm using [[https://shadow-cljs.org/][shadow-cljs]] which I like very much
along with [[https://tailwindcss.com/][tailwindcss]] for styling. I also mention [[https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm][NVM]] for managing
node/npm etc. which you'll also need. 

On the Emacs side you'll see a bit of [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider][cider]] along with [[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens][smartparens]] and
you can find my full config at https://github.com/zamansky/dot-emacs.

I was thinking about also making the following ClojureScript videos if
the communities find value in them and I have time:

 1. How to create reusable components like an input field with label.
 2. Creating a simple Electron app using shadow-cljs.
 3. Creating something with both  server side and client side.
 4. Also open to suggestions

I don't pretend to be a cljs or webdev master so please let me know if
I'm doing anything horribly wrong and let me know if you want more.


Enjoy.
