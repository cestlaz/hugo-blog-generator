Natan commenting on work the  other day:

<blockquote>

"You have two lists. One is sorted, the other is not. Every item in
one list corresponds to an item in the other. Is it faster to sort the
unsorted list and then merge them, or simply go through the unsorted
list in order and pair each item with the item you can find in the
presorted list?" is a question I asked today in the dressing room of
an off-Broadway theater. I've used RegEx at my job before, but I never
thought Big O notation would become relevant!

Let this be submitted as evidence that a computer science education is
valuable no matter what field you go into. That, or I'm just a
particular kind of crazy.
</blockquote>

There's clearly an unplugged activity here :-)
