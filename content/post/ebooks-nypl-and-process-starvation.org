I'm a big fan of E Ink e-readers. I had one a number of years ago. An [[https://www.mobiletechreview.com/gadgets/Astak-EZ-Reader.htm][Aztak EZ
Reader]]. It was great. Small, cheap, and independent - that is, not
tied in to Amazon or Barnes and Nobles and I found myself doing a lot
more recreational reading with it. I still preferred paper for
technical books but for easy reading  there was nothing like having
tons of reading options always available.

Alas it sadly committed suicide by diving from my hand onto the hard
stone floor of the NY Post office as I waited on the passport line. I
tried other e-readers since then but found E ink so much easier on the
eyes. Not wanting to do my usual "schlepp all the books I might want
to read" on vacation a few years ago, I bit the bullet and bought a
kindle. 

When I originally had the EZ-Reader I loaded it with mostly public
domain books. With the Kindle, I have purchased a small number of
books from Amazon to go along with all sorts of goodies from [[https://www.gutenberg.org/][Project
Gutenberg]] but there's also been one HUGE change in the landscape. The
[[https://nypl.overdrive.com/][New York Public Library]].  Public libraries are some of our greatest
public goods and it's unfortunate that they're perpetually
underfunded. Where else can a kid or indeed anyone go on any given day
and spend time indoors with no expectation of spending money. What's
more in addition to books and now movies and sometimes games they
provide all manner of community services and programs to and for the
public. In terms of e-books though, you can use the NYPL without
leaving the comfort of your home.

NYPL has a web site where you can search for and take out ebooks and
have them sent right to your kindle for 28 days at a time. If they
don't have enough copies - something of a ludicrous point for a
digital resource, you can place it on hold. If it's close to being
due, you can renew it unless someone else is on the queue at which
point the renewal request becomes a hold request. It's all rather
seamless.

My reading habits now regularly include taking out books from the
library and that's led to an interesting resource issue - process
starvation.

In case there are any on CS people reading this, everything running on
your computer at any point in time is a process. Each process gets a
small slice of computer time and it appears that the computer is
running everything at once. Some processes have a higher priority and
can get a bigger slice of time. On older "batch processing" systems,
high priority processes or jobs would run before lower priority
ones. For example, in a university setting, jobs submitted by
professors would be run before jobs submitted by grad students before
those submitted by undergrads. 

This of course could lead to some processes never getting run if
higher priority jobs keep getting submitted. There's an apocryphal
story about a computer at MIT that had a job submitted in 1967 but
still hadn't run in 1973.

So what's happening to me? I have a number of free books just sitting
on my kindle as well as books that I've purchased. My friend Paul said
I had to read "Algorithms to Live By" so that's thre. So is "Captains
Courageous" because I think I want to read it. There are also a bunch of
others. The trouble is, I keep seeing books that I want to read in the
library and I only have a 28 day window to read them, Most recently it
was "Sapiens" but before that it was "Turn Right at Machi Picchu" and
I read that right after "How Chance and Stupidity Have Changed
History," "The Witch of Lime Street." and "The Man with the Sawed-Off
Leg and Other Tales of a New York City Block." As soon as, or before I
finish one, there's a new one on hold and then on loan and the books I
own keep getting pushed back.

Operating Systems usually implement process aging. If a job isn't
handled fdor a long period of time its priority is increased. This
means that eventually it will be run. I guess I could do that and just
force myself to not read the next hot library book but I don't kow if
I have that in me.
