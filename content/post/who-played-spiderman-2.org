When we left off [[/post/who-played-spiderman/][last time]] we used a search engine API to gather a
whole bunch of documents with the term "played Spiderman" or "who
played Spiderman." Now we have to process these documents to answer
the question. Fortunately, the documents are basically just big
strings of text.

Since we're doing a "who" query  we want to find all the names in all
the documents. This leads to a class discussion on how to find names
in a large string. They'll come up with rules like:

- two adjacent words each with a capital first letter.
- an honorific (Mr, Ms, etc.) followed by a capitalized word
- A word that matches a name from a "popular name" list followed by a
  capitalized word.

The class might come up with different or additional rules. Actually
writing the code to pull out the names is an nice little assignment
that can be done with classes at many different levels. A beginning
class might just use string operations while an intermediate one could
use regular expressions. 

Will the students write code that always finds all the names? Probably
not. Will their code incorrectly identify some word sets as names?
Most likely. It doesn't really matter. Actually, this is a good
thing. You now have a great platform to talk about false positives and
true negatives.

Now the moment of truth - what's the most common name? To answer that
you have to decide on the meaning of "most common." Is it the name
that appeared the most times? How about the name that appeared in the
most documents? Does it matter? Whichever way you do it, chances are
the correct answer will be near the top of your list.

Next up in part 3 - other types of queries and why I love this sequence of
lessons so much.
