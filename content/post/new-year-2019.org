I've never been much of a New Years person. I get up really early and
so don't usually stay up late and more to the point, as any teacher
knows, the year really goes from September through June with that
really long much needed  weekend that you regular folks call July and
August tacked on to separate years.

This whole January first thing is really more  of a half time break or
perhaps an intermission.

Regardless, I did start the calendar year productively - it was
warm enough for a run and on my way back got my first [[https://www.citibikenyc.com/bikeangels/][Bike Angel]] point
of the month and year.

Since I see January 1 as more of a mid year point than a start, I'm
not going to reflect back on what was or project what will be but I do
have a few projects that I want to make some headway on before classes
resum in a few weeks.

First and foremost, I'm teaching Data Structures for the first time at
Hunter. Sure, I've taught it dozens of times but this will be
different. I haven't done it in C++ since 2003 and teaching it in
college twice a week Mon/Thu for about 1:15 is not the same as high
school where we meet every day for 0:43. I've already been boning up
on my C++. Templates are much more of a pain than I remember them and
I still much prefer toString to operator overloading. I think once
I've written some more code and am back up to speed I'll have a lot of
fun with the class.

The other big project is that I want to make some progress on an
[[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/time-to-create-an-ethics-course/][Ethics course]] that I want to have as part of my soon to be approved (I
hope) pre-service programs. I also want to make it available to
undergrads. I've been collecting thoughts and ideas for a couple of
months now and while I still believe that ethics is too important to
just be contained within a course - it must be woven through all our
courses, I do think I've got an overall plan that will result in a
very solid course.

There are a couple of other projects I'm working on that I Can't talk
about right now but I have no doubt I'll be keeping myself busy.

So to all the teachers out there, Happy Half Time and to everyone
else, Happy New Year.
