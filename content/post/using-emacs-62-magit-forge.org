Ever since I started looking at Magit as a "git dashboard" instead of
as a "git interface" it's been yet another Emacs killer app to me. I
just recently started playing with [[https://github.com/magit/forge][forge]] which allows [[https://github.com/magit/magit][Magit]] to
interface and interact with git "forges" like GitHub. This allows you
to work on issues and pull requests without ever leaving Emacs.

Here's a video on how easy it is. The video doesn't show this but the
first time you fire forge up it will prompt you for credentials. 

Also, if you aren't familiar with GitHub issues, check out the
post/video I made a few days ago ([[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/git-issues/][link]]) and you can check out my
earlier post/video on Magit as well ([[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-47-magit/][link]]).

Enjoy.
