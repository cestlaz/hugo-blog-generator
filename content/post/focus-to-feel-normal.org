While Cory's right about this it's also good to remember that as
we're all going remote, focusing on our courses can be important for
our students not merely due to content but in this time of uncertainty
to have something to focus on to remind us of community and remind us
of normal.


While all our students are now home or being sent home they're going
to be in semi isolation. Most will be with families but many will be
isolated from friends and classmates and without our courses, in a
limbo state left to obsess and stress over the current state of
affairs.

Focusing on our class  - through synchronous onlinen classes and
mailing lists, working on assignments, and otherwise engaging in this
approximation of our students regular weeks we're providing a valuable
distraction in addition to whatever actual course material we can
cover.

I've seen it before. After 9/11 and to a lesser extent after
Sandy. After 9/11 we were closed for about a a week. Based on the
email list I was able to put together and the back and forths I had
between parents and students stress was high, information and outlets
low. We managed to set up one event that got a bunch of students
together and it was really needed. We restarted classes at Brooklyn
Tech and stayed for close to a month. Classes were half length
starting in the afteroon. I was teaching CS without any real computer
access, some classes shared rooms and in general it's debatable how
much learning happened. What it did do though, is it gave the kids
something to focus on other than the 9/11 attacks and their
aftermath. It wasn't normal but it was "normaler." 

In the years that followed, I'd hear from both parents and students -
a number of whom I never taught about how important it was giving them
something to do other than obsess about the events of the day.

Same thing after Sandy. Some students weren't all that affected but
others suffered tremendous losses. We set up virtual classes for a
couple of days while school wasn't in session. Again, it gave them
something to focus on that wasn't the superstorm.

Same thing this time around. We all should be aware and alert to
everything happening but we also need community and things to focus
on. Our classes can be one of those things.
