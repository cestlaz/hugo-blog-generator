Out of class student communication is always a challenge. There are
plenty of options:

 - Piazza
 - Facebook group
 - Slack, Discord, or other chat system
 - Discourse, Vanilla or other discussion forum system
 - Mailing list

but all have warts. 

I shared my thoughts on a number of these options [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/class-communications/][a while ago]] but
thought I'd update them now.

Most of my opinions hold form my earlier post. I was using and
continue to use a mailing list as I can be pretty sure that students
will get the email and they don't have to go to any outside site or
application. Now, getting them to respond or just use it for general
class communication is another story.

I also tried Slack again but it fared no better than my last attempt
with it. A couple of students used it but mostly, Slack was left to
die. I could have forced some engagement by posting assignments on
Slack but there wasn't any real upside. 

Earlier this semester some students said we should set up Discord -
"all the students use it!" was the line. Discord can be used as a chat
server similar to Slack but was created for gaming and also does voice
communication and other things. Personally, I prefer Slack. Funny
thing was that as I discussed this with my students I pointed out "you
know, we have a Slack channel set up and you all already have accounts
on it." Most of them didn't even remember. 

So, we tried Discord and there was the usual burst of activity when we
first set it up but now it's again, mostly dormant. A few students who
use Discord for personal use are usually online but I'd chalk it up as
another failure.

So, what am I going to try next? GitHub. 

GitHub doesn't provide a general chat or email solution but it does
have what they call "issues."  I got the idea from [[https://twitter.com/ericdrosado][Eric Rosado]] of
GitHub Education who clued me in on what issues can do.

When you create a GitHub repository - something I do for class web
pages as well as assignments, you can also open issues. Issues are
associated with the project but also act as a lightweight forum. You
can go to a page and see all the issues (topics) and each one can have
a chain of messages (thread). You can tag them, filter them, and when
you're done, close them (and reopen them later if needs be). The big
plusses are that:
 1. People who are subscribed to the repo (assignment, web page, etc.)
    automatically get email alerts on the issues.
 2. You can explicitly tag people to force them to get alerts.
 3. You can directly reply via email so you don't need to go to
    GitHub.
 4. Everything related to a given project or repo is self contained.
 5. If you're using GitHub / GitHub classroom you can use issues to
    create a logged communication with your students on specific assignments.


I haven't used this class wide yet - just experimented a bit but I
plan to dive in much more deeply next semester.

This isn't an overall communication solution. I'm sticking with a
mailing list for that until I can find a better solution but I think
using GitHub issues will be a win for project and assignment related
discussion.
