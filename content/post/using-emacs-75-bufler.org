Quick Emacs hit today.

After my last video, I received a comment noting that I was using
ibuffer and that there was another package I might want to consider -
[[https://github.com/alphapapa/bufler.el][bufler]]. 

I started with basic ibuffer and then started to [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-34-ibuffer-emmet/][customize it]] to group
buffers but that was always somewhat finicky. More often than not I
couldn't tune it the way I wanted. Most recently, I started using
[[https://github.com/purcell/ibuffer-projectile][ibuffer-projectile]] which group projects for me but lost the other
customizations. In any event, I was more or less happy with things.

[[https://github.com/alphapapa/bufler.el][Bufler]] though looks to be a nice alternative. Out of the box it looks
like it groups things pretty well and has a nice Emacs [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra]] that you
can bring up with ~?~ to remind you how to do things like kill one or
more buffers.  

Right now, I'm using it as an ibuffer replacement but it also has its
own version of switch buffer that I plan to play with as well. 

The only knit I've found thus far is that when you run bufler, it
splits the window and lists the buffers in the new space. If I'm using
ibuffer I want it to use the whole Emacs frame. Otherwise I just use
ivy-switch-buffer (or now bufler-switch-buffer). I couldn't figure out
a way built in so ended up writing a small function: 

{{< highlight lisp >}}
(defun mz/bufler-one-window (&optional force-refresh)
  (interactive "P")
  (bufler-list)
  (delete-other-windows)

)

(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-b") 'mz/bufler-one-window)
{{< /highlight >}}
