I was originally going to do a video on how I set things up so that I
get an email every morning with my org-mode agenda but that's going to
be something of an ordeal. I have to create a droploet on Digital
Ocean, set up SyncThing and a mail server and lots of other things.

I'll get to that video at some point but in the meantime I saw [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/9rvboq/what_emacs_packages_have_upped_your_game_recently/][this
thread]] on the Emacs subreddit.

It asked about packages people used to "up their Emacs game." I've
done videos on some of the packages mentioned and there were some
packages that I'd never heard of that I now have to check out. 

One of the packages, [[https://github.com/wasamasa/eyebrowse][eyebrowse]] was one that I've been meaning to play
with for a while. Eyebrowse allows you to easily keep track of
window/buffer configurations. It's pretty easy and pretty cool.

Here's a quick video overview:
