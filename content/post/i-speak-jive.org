When I wrote about the [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/highedweb2019/][HighWebEd]] I mentioned [[https://twitter.com/elfin_john][John William]]''s talk on
Agile. He spoke about how the movie Airplane! was filmed in an Agile
manner and gave as an example the development of the "jive" scenes.

Apparently the creative team had a script but it wasn't working. The
first pair that read for the role, Norman Gibbs and Al White had their
owned take. Not only dir the team cast them on the spot and follow
their creative lead (hence Agile) but they also apparently apologized
to the two actors as the original attempt was so bad compared t what
Gibbs and White brought to the table.

Of course, I would be negligent if I didn't mention that the third
person to really make the jive sequence was Barbara Billingsley of
Leave it to Beaver fame.

So, coming home, I had the Airplane! and the jive scenes in the back
of my mind. The other day at home, somehow or other we were chatting
about that great American masterpiece, The Muppet Show and of course,
the Swedish Chef.

This brought me back the the [[https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Encheferizer\][Encheferizer]] (live version [[http://www.tuco.de/home/jschef.htm][here]]).

So how is jive from Airplane! related to The Swedish Chef?

*Filters!!!!!!!!*

A filter, in this context, is a program that takes data as input, in
this case a stream of text. Does some transformation to it and then
spits out the transformed text.

Way back, Unix systems had a program called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jive_filter][jive]] that "translated"
text into Jive along with other filters including cockney and valspeak which
converted text to like, um, Valley Girl speak dontcha know. It was,
like, totally tubular. Of course one filter was named *chef*, known as
the encheferizer which translated into Swedish Chef talk.

Over time, the list of filters grew. Some were silly, some fun, and,
yes, some were kind of offensive.

(side bar: as I write this bit of history, I just feel as though I've
been transported to Doug Peterson's [[https://dougpete.wordpress.com/2019/11/03/whatever-happened-to-183/][Whatever happened to...]] posts and
feel as though I should write something like: Do you remember using
filters? Which ones did you use? etc.)

Anyway, somewhere in here there's the making of some nice class
projects but the challenge was how to do the translation. Some things
are easy. One filter was the Fudd filter which translated to [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmer_Fudd][Elmer
Fudd]] speak. It's easy enough to substitute *w* for *l* in a word as
Elmer says "Hew wow" instead of "Hello" but it's hard to know if you've
got enough translation rules so that your students text will change
enough to be entertaining.

Fortunately, I found [[- https://github.com/hyperrealm/talkfilters][this]] repo. It's an implementation of a whole
bunch of filters:

#+begin_quote
austro (Think Ahhnolld), b1ff (a web newbie), brooklyn, butthead (as
in Beevis and), chef, cockney, drawl, dubya, fudd, funetak, jethro,
jive, kraut, newspeak, pansy, pirate, postmodern, redneck, valspeak, warez
#+end_quote

I couldn't get the system to compile but was able to dive into the
source code to see the rules. They're in the *.l* files. All of those
files are source for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_%2528software%2529][Lex]] parser generator but even if you aren't
familiar with Lex you should be able to figure out most of the rules.

Some of the translators rely mostly on simple letter
substitutions. Fudd is such a filter:

{{< highlight lex >}}
"r"         gtf_printf("w");
"l"         gtf_printf("w");
"qu"        gtf_printf("qw");
"th "       gtf_printf("f ");
"th"        gtf_printf("d");
"n."        gtf_printf("n, uh-hah-hah-hah. ");
"R"         gtf_printf("W");
"L"         gtf_printf("W");
"Qu"        gtf_printf("Qw");
"QU"        gtf_printf("QW");
{{< /highlight >}}




Dubya, on the other hand goes more with word substitutions:

{{< highlight lex >}}
[Tt]errorist		|
[Oo]sama		|
[Bb]in(-|{WB})[Ll]ad(e|i)n	{ switch(gtf_random(3))
				  {
				  case 0: gtf_puts_case("bad guy"); break;
				  case 1: gtf_puts_case("evildoer"); break;
				  case 2: gtf_puts_case("terrier"); break;
				  }
				}
[Uu]njustified/{NW}	     gtf_puts_case("pre-emptive");
[Cc]ontra/{NW}		     gtf_puts_case("freedom-fighter");
[Un]nder		     gtf_puts_case("misunder"); BEGIN(INW);
[Mm]isunderstand	     gtf_puts_case("misunderestimate"); BEGIN(INW);
[Mm]isunderstood             gtf_puts_case("misunderestimated"); BEGIN(INW);
[Kk]ill/{NW}		     gtf_puts_case("oblitifry");
[Kk]illed/{NW}		     gtf_puts_case("oblitifried");
[Dd]destroy/{NW}	     gtf_puts_case("destructifry");
[Dd]destroyed/{NW}	     gtf_puts_case("destructifried");
[Rr]esonat/{NW}		     gtf_puts_case("resignat");
[Ee]ven(-|{WB})[Hh]anded/{NW} gtf_puts_case("foreign-handed");
[Ee]mbitter		     gtf_puts_case("embetter"); BEGIN(INW);
[Ff]allability/{NW}	     gtf_puts_case("fallacy");
[An]tidote/{NW}		     gtf_puts_case("anecdote");
{{< /highlight >}}

Some, like chef, pirate, and aust do some of both:

{{< highlight >}}
[Tt]h		gtf_puts_case("z");
w		gtf_puts("v");
ou		gtf_puts("u");
"de "		gtf_puts("d ");
"le "		gtf_puts("l ");
"me "		gtf_puts("m ");
"ne "		gtf_puts("n ");
"re "		gtf_puts("r ");
"ve "		gtf_puts("v ");
[Cc]		gtf_puts_case("s");
[Pp]ie		gtf_puts_case("mozer's pie");
[Ss]teak        gtf_puts_case("shnitzel");
[Gg]overnor	gtf_puts_case("govenator");
{{< /highlight >}}

Some also deal with more complex situations such as only substituting
letters if they're at the end of words and the like.

All of this is leading to a huge number lesson and project
possibilities from simple text replacements in an intro class to
something much more ambitious in a later class.

I was looking to vary some of the things we do in Hunter and I think
I'll add some language filters to the mix.
