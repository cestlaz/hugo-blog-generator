It's Monday morning, 7:45AM local time. Being on East Coast time,
Devorah and I have already been up for about 3 hours, hit the gym and
our first cups of our chosen caffeinated beverages.

Since it's not unbearably hot outside  - a cool and dry  80 in the
shade  - we're sitting outside. Devorah's knitting another square for
[[http://blanketstatementproject.com/][Blanket Statement]] so I figured I'd write a few words about  what we've
been doing here in Phoenix leading up to our starting with our
conference later today.

Whenever we travel for "business"  I'll try to tack on a day or so to
try to soak up at least a little local flavor and there's plenty of
local flavor in Phoenix. 

After checking in to the hotel we hit the [[https://www.phoenix.gov/parks/arts-culture-history/pueblo-grande/][Pueblo Grande]] museum. It's a
pre-columbian archaeological site. You can learn about the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohokam][Hohokam]] who
used to live - see a bit how they lived and the intricate canal
systems they created. The outside path that toured the ruins was about
a half mile walk in the 105 degree hot sun but it was worth it. Inside
there were galleries with a few exhibits and a lot of neat
history. Well worth the visit. We also walked around [[https://heritagesquarephx.org/][Heritage Square]]
which had some original Victorian buildings but I wasn't really super
impressed - probably had something to do with having by that time been
out in the heat for most of the afternoon.

Yesterday, it was up bright and early to check out the [[https://www.dbg.org/][Desert Botanical
Garden]]. Wow - this is a must see.

Did I mention it was really hot out?

When we started at 7:00am it wasn't so bad out - about 85 and only a
touch humid but after a couple of hours we needed some AC. We
originally wanted to hike over to the [[https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g31310-d126770-Reviews-Hole_in_the_Rock-Phoenix_Arizona.html][Hole in the Rock]] but were by
that time leery of the heat so we took a Lyft back into town for some
breakfast.  We chose a place but as we approached there was a long
line outside. Our driver said "I know a much better place" turned off
the meter, and took us to [[http://hob-nobs.com/][HobNobs]]. It was the right choice. Service
was a bit slow but good food in a comfortable environment.

We weren't sure what to do next when I noticed Sarah Judd tweed that
the Museum of Musical Instruments was free for teachers. It's about 30
minutes out of the downtown but we took the trip. I was a little irked
that the web site said that "educators" were free during the month of
July but they didn't accept my Hunter ID as a teacher. They were
limiting the free admission to K12 teachers. Still, the museum was
terrific. Gotta love a place that doesn't take themselves too
seriously:

Exhibits on instruments and musicians. If it weren't at the end of a
long touring day I think we could have spent another hour or two
there. 

We ended up getting a locally made menorah for Natan before we left:

Yesterday concluded at the GitHub for Education reception where I had
a great conversation with Nick Stoyas about his efforts in Chicago to
scale out their CS programs and thoughts on internship opportunities
for high school students. I hope to write more on that later. 

In about 45 minutes we'll head out to [[https://heard.org/][The Heard Museum]] which is all
about Native American art and culture.

That should bring us to lunch today and then conference time!!!

If you're reading this and at the CSTA2019 - hope you also get or got
to see some sites and swing by the Github booth to say hi. If not, if
you have a chance to get out to Phoenix, preferably in the cooler
months, I would certainly recommend it.
