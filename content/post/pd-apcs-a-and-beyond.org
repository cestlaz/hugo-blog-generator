A while ago I wrote about [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pd-in-nyc/][our plans]] at Hunter to run professional
development for CS teachers. Specifically, running once a month
sessions for teachers who teach APCS-A, similar and beyond.

The idea started as a joke but morphed into a legit idea.

I was talking to some friends about CTLE hours and how ridiculous the
system is. NY State teachers need 100 hours of CTLE credit (PD hours)
every so many years. It's something of a scam for a few
reasons. First, two of the biggest providers are the NYC DOE and the
UFT, the teacher's union. I've been told they both charge money for
many CTLE credit bearing activities. That certainly doesn't seem
kosher -- your boss and your union set up a system to charge you to keep your
job. 

Well, it turns out that Hunter is certified to issue CTLE credits so
we joked that we should get dinner and hang out once a month and call
it professional development. We were only half joking - whenever you
get a bunch of teachers in a room they talk shop and that is actually
the best PD there is. Upon talking among ourselves and also to other
teachers we realized there was a legitimate need for PD for teachers
who were beyond the basics and so we turned this silly idea into the
real deal.

Last Thursday we had our first session. We had about 25 attendees for
a three hour session.

I can't tell you if it was any good - you'll have to ask the
participants, I can tell you what we did and what we plan moving
forward.

We started with a content piece. I ran through [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-03-23-who_won_the_election-quadratic_to_linear_time/][this lesson]] (or [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/when-they-change-the-script/][this
one]]) where the students find the mode of a list, realize it's a slow
(n^2) algorithm and then refine it to a linear solution. The key idea
is to give the students an intuitive feeling for run time issues and
also to introduce them to [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-11-17-hidden-complexity.html/][hidden complexity]].

After this we had dinner, provided by our friends at Google. Over
dinner the teachers talked shop. In addition to getting to know each
other, their programs, and their classes we also asked them to
consider these three items:

 - What are things that cause you difficulty that you'd like us to
   cover?
 - What are things you wish you knew about that you'd like us to
   cover?
 - What are things you're comfortable with that you'd be willing to
   share with the group?

After dinner we circled up and JonAlf presented the way he set up
student note taking in his class.

Finally, we discussed next steps - specifically what we came up with
for those three bullet points above.

I like the idea of having at least one short content piece, one short
pedagogy piece and a deeper dive at each meeting. For the first one,
JonAlf and I had to guess as to what might be useful and at the
appropriate level. We advertised for teachers who did APCS-A, similar,
or beyond but I'm sure we had teachers for whom the mode lesson was a
bit too advanced to do without scaffolding and also some for whom it
was way to simple. As we continue to meet, we'll nail down the right
level and the right activities.

The real hope is that many of the participants will become regulars
and together we'll turn this into both an amazing once a month
activity and also a community of teachers.

Right now, I'm looking for companies who want to feed us and possibly
provide space so if you know of any, hook me up. We're also collecting
feedback and ideas from the attendees. 

We're targetting February for our next session followed by March,
April, May and possibly June.

In the meantime, stay tuned.
