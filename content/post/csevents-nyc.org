A couple of weeks ago, a handful of CS Ed folks got together. One
issue we discussed was that of finding CS related events both for
students and teachers. 

One of our conveners, Dan Fenjves of [[https://www.upperlinecode.com/][UPPERLINE CODE]] talked about
possibly hosting a central site. Today, Dan announced
http://csevents.nyc/. A site where organizers can submit and students
and teachers can find upcoming events. Right now it's NY centric but
it does list some events beyond the city.

If you're planning an event or CS Educational opportunity, submit it,
if you're looking for one, check it out.
