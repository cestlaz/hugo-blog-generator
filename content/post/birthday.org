In the 10 plus years of this blog I've never done a post on my
birthday. Okay, maybe I've written one *on* my birthday but never
talked about it.

Why this year?

No particular reason. Maybe because I'm getting older. I'm 53
today. Devorah will turn 54 in a month - from there one year until she
can retire. I can follow a year later. I'm pretty happy with what I'm
doing but it's nice to know that in two years I'll have a lot of
options on the table. I can stay the course or maybe look for new
challenges. By then, should things continue apace, my undergraduate
program will have been running and growing for seven years, I'll have had
three cohorts of teachers go through my advanced certificate program
and I should even have my first Masters in CS Education graduates. 

For today, it's mostly business as usual. Plan is to head out for my
morning run, come back and teach class. 

After that, I'll head down to Varick Street to drop off my ballot. 

As to the rest of the day, we'll see. I'll probably spend most of it
trying to set up virtual school visits.  Looking forward to the family
dinner - Natan's cooking tonight as he does often so I know it'll be
tasty.
