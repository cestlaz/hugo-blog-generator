When I was writing the [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/i-speak-jive/][I Speak Jive]] post, the first thing I had to do
was find those old programs. It turned out to be harder than I
thought. I found online versions but it took a while to find [[https://github.com/hyperrealm/talkfilters][this]]
GitHub repo.

On the way, I seemed to recall that these might be bundled with a
bunch of old [[https://github.com/vattam/BSDGames][BSD games]] so I took a look at the BSD games package for
Linux. While I didn't find the filters, I found a whole bunch of old
programs that I hadn't played with in years along with a few that I
never knew existed. To me it felt like an interesting project and
lesson treasure trove so I wanted to share.

I think this makes more sense to do as a video so I can actually show
the programs as they run so check out the video at the end of this
post.

In the video I talk about controlling the cursor on the screen so that
students can write programs like the ones I demo. That can be done in
a number of ways. You could use a library like [[https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna][lanterna]] for Java or
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_%2528programming_library%2529][curses]] or ncurses for C but you can also just use Ansi Escape
codes. Basically you print out [[http://ascii-table.com/ansi-escape-sequences-vt-100.php][special escape squences]] to move the
cursor, clear the screen and even set text and background colors. For
example, to move the cursor to the middle of the screen and print
*Hello* you would use this: ~System.out.print("^[[12;40HHello");~ The
first ~^[~ is actually the ascii code for the escape character. I
enter it in Emacs by typing Control-q then hitting the escape
key. Other editors will have a way of doing the same.

So here you go -- old BSD games. I hope you get as many ideas out of
this as I did.
