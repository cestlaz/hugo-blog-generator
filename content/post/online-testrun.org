Hunter's classes are still on hiatus while we figure out how we're
going to deliver instruction remotely. I have it easier than
most. First, my students all get laptops as being part of the Daedalus
program. This doesn't mean they have great internet access or access
at all but it does mean they have a device that can run everything we
need them to run. I don't yet know if they all have adequate internet
access but I'm hoping it's either not an issue or one that we can
easily figure out.

Next, software. Again, I'm lucky. Zoom seems to be the best of breed
for synchronous stuff and as faculty in the school of education, I
have an account. The rest of the CS faculty don't. The rest of Hunter
has to use some combination of Blackboard based tools and freely
available stuff. 

Today, we tested everything out. I had about 10 students volunteer. We
did a Zoom meeting and tried all the feature: 

- public and private chat
- screen sharing
- whiteboards
- breakout rooms

The breakout rooms were the big thing I wanted to check out. They're a
little clunky but overall pretty nice. It's a bit kludgey when someone
joins the conference after breakout rooms are formed but overall it
worked well.

For async stuff we'll mostly stick with the same tools - email, GitHub
and GitHub classroom but I think we'll also give Slack another go. My
problem with Slack is that it didn't seem to work well within the
students day. It may work for a professional in front of their screen
most of the day but students are in and out of class and other
obligations. They'll miss the real time flow and then have to navigate
through a muddy thread stream to catch up.

Now with everyone working from home Slack might be a better fit. We'll
see.

Thursday I go live. 

I think the lesson I'm planning for my CS1 translates pretty easily to
online but might have to work my CS2 plans. In any event we'll see how
it goes.

I'm sure the rest of the semester will be challenging for all of us
but I also know it's okay if we fumble through and make mistakes. [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/focus-to-feel-normal/][It's
not all about the content]]. 

Would love to hear from my fellow teachers how it's working with
them. Alfred Thompson has already been blogging about [[http://blog.acthompson.net/2020/03/teaching-from-homeday-1.html][his experiences]]
with going remote so we're getting play by play from a rural private
(Catholic) high school. I'll add the NYC public college
experience.

If you want to share how it's going for you but don't blog, send it as
a long comment or do a guest post.

We'll all be more isolated physically over the next few weeks so let's
share more in the digital world.
