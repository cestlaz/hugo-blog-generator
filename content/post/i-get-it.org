I was reading Mary Clair Wright's new [[https://computationalthinkinginroom112.com/][blog]] the other day. It's always
great to see another teacher sharing publicly online.

One line caught my eye in her [[https://computationalthinkinginroom112.com/2020/04/07/ap-csa-enrichment-gone-awry/][latest post]] -

Remote instruction is weird, I canâ€™t see them. I have to trust that they will message me with questions.

This is a real problem. It's hard enough in a regular class where we
can pick up an all sorts of cues and use all sorts formal and informal
assessments but when the students are on the other end of a
teleconference or even more challenging an email or chat it's even
harder.

It's also a reminder of how important those non verbal clues and
student feedback can be.

It's great if we can create an environment where our students will ask
for help if they don't know something but even under normal
circumstances there's the danger of students thinking they get
it. If a student is totally lost they'll usually know they're totally
lost but after that, it's not so clear. 

A student might think they get it if they can basically follow along
with what's being presented. It's pretty easy to watch another student
or a teacher go through explaining a solution step by step and think
you really know what's going on. Similarly they can read through an
example in a text or on a web site and think they understand. A little
better is when they can do the first couple of problems in the book
but those frequently mimic the samples and don't require any
additional insight. Even in a traditional class a student can go week
to week like this and really think they understand things and then
they get hit over the head on a test or right before a big assignment
is due. 

This isn't the student's fault. It's hard to know what you don't know
and truth be told, we don't really teach our students how to study and
self assess. It's also really hard for teachers to assess this even in
person. Now that we're all remote it's yet another huge red flag to
look out for.

No solutions here today and no suggestions just yet another concern as
we continue to work to do right by our kids.
