I've been spending a lot of time at area high schools this fall. Today
I was at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt_High_School_(New_York_City)][FDR High School]] in Broooklyn.

I only learned about FDR HS a little over a year ago when I met their
CS teacher [[https://twitter.com/jhans404][Josh Hans]] at a NYC PD event. I visit last fall and then
again today.

Whenever I visit a school it's a different experience. Sometimes I
speak to the CS classes, sometimes at an event like a CS Week
hackathon, once I even got to address an entire senior class in an
auditorium. 

I really loved how Josh and FDR set things up for me today.

Before I get to the arrangement, let's talk about the talk.

When I meet with a room of seniors, even a room full of CS students, I
know that only a few students are going to end up with me at
Hunter. A room of 30 seniors should probably end up in something like
25 different colleges. I also know that even in a CS class many of
the students will end up pursuing other majors.

I really don't think it's right for me to take a full class period and
talk just about Hunter and my Daedalus program so instead I start by
talking about college choices. I try to share things that I've learned
over my career as a student, teacher, parent, and now someone reading
applications with my audiuence. Things I've learned from both my
experiences and through my relationships with former students. At the
end we talk about Hunter, Hunter CS and the Daedalus program.

I've been told that the approach has been really valuable to the
majority of students I've delivered it to.

There were a few things that Josh set up today that made it a lot of
fun. First, we were in the auditorium. I had Josh's APCS-A class but
he also invited a couple of others. I also had APCS-P students and
also a class of Calculus students. This was a big deal. Just like
everyone, I'm working hard to build a program with a diverse
population and sometimes outreach is difficult. Specifically, if a
school only allows me to speak with their APCS-A students, I
frequently end up with a pre-culled group. If a school, for example,
has a very low percentage of women in their APCS-A class and that's
where I'm speaking, I'm not going to be able to convince many women to
look into what we're offering. By having the calc sutdents in the
audience I had a more diverse audience and also almost certainly had
the chance to expose some students to CS in a new and different
way. Now, don't get me wrong. Given the nature of my program, I really
love talking to APCS-A students and going with probability, they're
the most likely the ones to want my program but I love casting the
wider net.

The other think Josh did was he gave me two periods. My talk usually
takes most of a period with little time for discussion. It should take
less but I tend to go into yammer mode and start telling
stories. Sorry - it's just what I do. With two periods we had plenty
of time for discussion afterwards. What's more, after most of the
students left, I was left with about 6 students who wanted to continue
to talk. I really enjoyed that. 

Once I was done I did what I usually do - went to the local bakery to
bring home some baked goods. I stopped at the [[https://www.google.com/maps/place/18th+Avenue+Bakery/@40.6212881,-73.9847415,17z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sbakery!3m4!1s0x0:0xd4dca91422790dec!8m2!3d40.6217849!4d-73.9877902][18th street Bakery]]. An
Italian place and got an assortment. Also had a great chat with the
lady at the counter. It reminded me of when I'd go to [[https://www.yelp.com/biz/moishes-kosher-bakery-new-york][Moishes Bakery]]
before they closed albeit Italian rather than Jewish. 

I pointed to a pile of cookes and asked "what are these?" and she
merely said "No!!!!!" We joked back and forth and she explained that
they were on the older side and didn't feel right selling them and was
going to throw the rest of the batch out. They'd bake new ones for
tomorrow. I was disappointed not to try a new cookie but glad that I
wasn't sold stale goods. It was like at Moishes when I once asked
about the Babka and was told "that was made  on Wednesday, you don't
want it. This is what's fresh. New Babka tomorrow.

So, then, on the way home, thinking about Moishes and realizing that
there were  also Jewish bakeries in the neighborhood I decided to see
if I could find [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kichel][Kichel]] - one of Devorah's favorite cookies. I
sometimes make them but haven't in a while. I found some at [[https://www.google.com/maps/place/Korn's+Bakery/@40.630628,-73.9799457,17z/data=!4m9!1m3!2m2!1sbakery!6e5!3m4!1s0x0:0xf6f303e4b6cd6dfe!8m2!3d40.6308331!4d-73.9764149][Korn's]]
Bakery and then it was back into Manhattan.

So, overall a succesful day. I got to talk to a bunch of great High
School cookies and got tasty neighborhood baked goods. 

I've hit a bunch of schools already this fall as I work to spread the
gospel about CS and about Hunter's [[http://info.huntercs.org][Daedalus]] program and am still
looking to get more on the schedule so if you know a school that's a
good fit a visit, hit me up.
