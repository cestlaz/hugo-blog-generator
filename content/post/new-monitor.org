Got a new monitor today and wanted to share.


My old one was a 27" Hanns G. Actually, the old ones - my old set up
was 2 of them side by side. When I started at Hunter, I was given a
piddly small monitor so I tried to buy my own 27" Hanns G to bring in
but they were no longer available. The 27" jobs available then were
much more expensive so my work monitor situation has been sadly
lacking.

The 2 27" setup worked pretty well but then I read [[https://hackernoon.com/the-best-display-for-programming-8aad0be4227d][this]] post and did a
little research. It turns out that Costco has a great deal on an [[https://www.costco.com/LG-43UD79-B-43%2522-Class-Ultra-HD-4K-IPS-Monitor.product.100378322.html][LG
43" 4K]] monitor so I took the plunge. I also had to pick up a [[https://www.amazon.com/EVGA-GeForce-Passive-Graphics-02G-P4-6332-KR/dp/B073VPKV26/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=gt+1030&qid=1552171987&s=gateway&sr=8-3][cheap
video card]] to drive it since I was just using onboard video and my
setup is pretty old.

It's HUGE. I love it but am now working to figure out how best to set
things up. 

The added bonus is that I can now bring one or both of the 27"
monitors to work!!!!!!

If you're on the  market for a new monitor I have to say that I'm
really happy with the LG. Just wanted to share.
