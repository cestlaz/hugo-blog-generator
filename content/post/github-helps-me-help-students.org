Earlier today I was reminded why I love GitHub in support of my
classes. One of my students posted a question about our current
lab. They posted a synopsis of the problem along with the error
message.

Since we're all working on GitHub the student's work was already up
online Since I started using [[https://classroom.github.com][GitHub Classroom]] I was able to quickly
navigate to the repo. This might have been enough but to really in to
the students work I cloned the repo and went into Emacs. Using [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-47-magit/][Magit]],
Emacs's Git interface I was quickly able to navigate the project and
also see recent changes or in fact any changes to any of the student's
project files. I didn't use it this time but [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-42-git-gutter/][Git Timemachine]] gives an
even slicker way to see the history of changes for a specific file.

With these tools it took almost no time to get the lay of the land and
figure out where the student hit the wall. From there I posted a hint to nudge the student in the
right direction.

GitHub classroom makes the student repo management easy but the other
tools were just plain old Git and Emacs. 

Of course, for this to work, students have to play their part. If a
student doesn't push their changes regularly up to GitHub I won't be
able to see the diffs and help. When they do, it's a real world tool
that once again has proven to be great at supporting education.
