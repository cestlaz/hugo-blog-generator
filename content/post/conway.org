We lost Mathematician [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway][John Conway]] to COVID-19 over the weekend. To
us non mathematicians Conway was most well known for his
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life][Game of Life]] - a particularly interesting cellular automaton. If you
poke around the web you can find all sorts of neat things relating to
the Game of Life including a [[http://www.rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm][Turing Machine]]. 

Some times, I'd have classes explore the Game of Life and variants as
a whole unit though more often, I use it as a stepping stone to using
Cellular Automata to solve problems. I've written about some of this.

I also saw this video over the weekend. It's a short interview from
2014. It's worth a watch.

I had the opportunity to meet Conway briefly  once about a decade ago. It was
an informal conversation at a puzzle conference. He was approachable
enough and nice enough but I didn't have a chance to really get into
anything in depth. Still, it was pretty cool to talk with him.

In the conversation he did mention "that F*ing Game of Life," possibly
somewhat unhappy at it's being what he's so well known for  but to us
in the CS Teaching space it by itself was a gift worthy of a legacy.
