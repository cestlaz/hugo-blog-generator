Org-mode is my markup of choice. I spend the vast majority of my time working
on text files working in org-mode. Since GitHUb started rendering
org-mode files in their site I've also used org-mode for things like
Readme files in my projects. I even force it on my students at
times. When I make an assignment, I seed it with an org-mode file that
they have to modify - that is - fill in things like their names, group
members etc..

That said, sometimes I have to work in plain old [[https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/][markdown]]. This is
almost always when I'm working on something collaboratively and more
often than not it's documentation on a project living on GitHub.

So, given that I have to work with Markdown, time to use some Emacs
magic to make it easy and fun.

To start, Emacs has a [[https://github.com/jrblevin/markdown-mode/tree/f3c54e34cc5228001af36a5301883325319f21d4][markdown mode]] along with a bunch of previewing
and rendering modes. I settled on [[https://github.com/seagle0128/grip-mode/tree/4c7014c8151e522b9dd94f878478087bf92ab10e][grip mode]]. 

You can check out the video to see grip-mode along with some of the
other modes I tried here:

Enjoy.
