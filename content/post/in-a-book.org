I was involved in a really exciting project a few months ago and now
that it's available, it's time to tell everyone about it.

There's a new book on teaching CS in K12 - [[https://www.shuchigrover.com/atozk12cs/][Computer Science in K12]]. 

I got an email a few months ago from [[https://twitter.com/shuchig][Shuchi Grover]]. Okay, actually a
DM over twitter. I hadn't officially met Shuchi although I'm pretty
sure we've been at the same table or group in a conference or two but
I did know her from reputation. Shuchi was putting together a book on
teaching CS in K12 and asked if I was interested in contributing a
chapter. I was flattered and honored and since I've never written a
chapter in a book I agreed. 

The book's made up of 26 chapters with a who's who of authors
including teachers, professors, researchers, and other CS Ed adjacent
professionals. Check out the full [[https://www.shuchigrover.com/atozk12cs/authors/][cast of characters]]. It was cool to
see many friends involved in the project. It should be a welcome
addition since I don't think there's anything like in currently out. 

I haven't read the full book - I'm anxiously awaiting my copy to
arrive but with chapter titles ranging from concepts like "Data Structures" and
"Repetition and Recursion" to techniques like "Questions and Inquiry"
and "Guided Exploration Through Unplugged Activities" it should be a
really valuable resource to teachers rather than just a book to use in
a class and keep on the shelf.

I worked on the chapter on functions. Once again I was paired with my
long time partner in crime JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver. Jens Monig, whom I
hadn't known prior also worked on the chapter contributing the drag
and drop material - something that neither JonAlf nor I felt
particularly comfortable with doing ourselves.

One weird thing, though it makes sense, was that I never interacted
with most of the other authors - just my chapter co-authors and
Shuchi. Nothing wrong with it but given the number of friends working
on the book and a chance to meet new friends it would have been great
to have something like a meetup at SIGCSE had it happened. On the
other hand, working with Shuchi was terrific. This not only gave me a
chance to contribute to a book but it also got us together and now I
look forward to future collaborations.

The other big take away for me was that writing the chapter was
fun. I've been playing with the idea of writing a book on teaching CS
but wasn't sure I'd enjoy the process. Now I think I might and I might
get started in August when I think I'll finally have some project
time. What do all of you think?
