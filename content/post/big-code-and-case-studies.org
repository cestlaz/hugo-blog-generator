I'm enjoying reading about Ria Galanos' new chapter on her blog. In
her [[https://cscheerleader.com/putting-it-all-together][most recent post]] Ria briefly talks about the fact that very few
professional developers start from scratch and most work in existing
large code bases. She wonders why the College Board got rid of the
APCS-A case study and talked about how it gave students an opportunity
to work on a multi-file complex system. Over the past few years others
have wondered if the College Board should bring it back.

While I agree that students should learn to work in a large code base
at some point in time and there are a whole bunch of software
engineering skills that would better serve the vast majority of CS
students than what is taught in full undergraduate programs I have to
disagree that bringing back the APCS-A case study is the way to go.

I'm not against case studies and large complex CS projects in APCS-A
per se but rather that tying a specific large project to the AP exam
forces teachers to teach in a way that might not suit them or their
students. The case study never worked for me. It never fit in with the
way I liked to develop my classes. As a result it was merely a time
sink. To be honest, most of the time I just paid it lip service with
minimal coverage. It never seemed to affect my student's scores so it
wasn't something I had to worry about. I also used to use a few texts
over the years that integrated a large project throughout their
chapters and since those also didn't mesh with the class it made large
swaths of the books more difficult to work through when trying to use
them to understand core concepts.

I haven't looked at all the newly released materials yet but I did
like the recent trend of making labs available that you could use to
cover core concepts but you didn't have to. The same could be done for
case studies. Nothing stops the College Board or independent providers
from releasing things like Grid World or other case studies. Make them
available for teachers who's classes are structured in ways that those
case studies support the class rather than are a forced add on.

Beyond this, we also have the issue with exposing kids to larger
sometimes partially opaque code bases. This is pretty important but
many students don't learn this until their on the job. 

At Hunter, we do have a capstone project course where students do
indeed create some large team application using multiple technologies
but they do it largely on their own having not formally been prepared
in their earlier classes for development in the large. In my
experience, huge numbers of students from a wide array of well
respected institutions do little better at this. Many students do have
to work in a professors framework - write a "player" for the game and
such but that's much more limited.

So, we should be doing a better job at this but I'm also not sure if
APCS-A is the place. While it might work well at a TJ, where Ria
taught or Stuy where I spent most of my career, my gut tells me that
this is something for a course later in the undergraduate sequence.

Regardless of when this is covered (if it's covered at all) it's
certainly worth teaching kids the common tooling to help them
along. Back in the day I used [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctags][Ctags]] to navigate large complex C code
bases. Ctags still exists in more modern forms and it and similar
tools work for a variety of languages. Coding standards like those
published by [[https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html][Google]] can make for an easier code based to understand
and tools like [[https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-jsp-135444.html][Javadoc]] and similar for other languages can create web
based documentation where students can click through complex
hierarchies and relationships. Tools like [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][Ripgrep]] and [[https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher][Silver Searcher]]
can also be lifesavers in finding code across complex directory
structures. Most if not all of these tools are directly supported in
many editors and ides.

So, where am I at on this. Let's not require any specific case study
in APCS-A but let's make things like them available. On the other
hand, it would be great if our students did indeed all have the
opportunity to learn how to work in large complex pre-existing code
bases but that's an issue well beyond just APCS-A and high school.
