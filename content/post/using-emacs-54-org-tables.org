As you know I use Emacs for all sorts of things. In addition to
coding, I use it for email, my schedule, note taking, and much much
more. As part of my job at Hunter, I read and evaluate some of the
Macaulay Honors College applications. I also have to evaluate all the
applicants to my CS honors program. I described how I use Org-mode and
Emacs to help with that [[https://cestlaz-nikola.github.io/posts/using-emacs-44-pdf/][here]]. Processing the Macaulay applications
though is somewhat different. 

I was given a list of student names and IDs as well as online access
to their applications. If I wasn't an Emacs user I'd probably dump the
list into a spreadsheet and go from there. It turns out, Org-mode has
a really nice table editor with just the spreadsheet functionality
that I needed. I had the ability to perform basic calculations on the
data while also keeping the power of Emacs for editing purpose.

Check out the video to see how it all works. 

For more information, you can check out this [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-spreadsheet-intro.html][tutorial]] on Org-mode
table formulas and the Org-mode [[https://orgmode.org/manual/The-Spreadsheet.html#The-Spreadsheet][documentation.]]

Enjoy!
