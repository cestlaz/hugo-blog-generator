I can't believe that I haven't made a video since the beginning of
summer!!!
 
Part of the reason is that I haven't had any video ideas that have
motivated me and the other reason is that the Fall is my busiest
season.

In any event, here's the latest installment.

Take a look at how I use Emacs and more specifically org-mode for my
day to day work. Sometimes I use the fancy power tools but to be
honest, most of the time, I stick to the basics. 

The point is that you don't have to be a real guru to use org-mode to
help you with organization and to increase productivity. Just a few
simple commands and you can accomplish a lot.

I hope you enjoy it.
