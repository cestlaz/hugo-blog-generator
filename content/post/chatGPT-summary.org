I know I said that I was done with chatGPT but since I've ended up
sharing my posts with a few people I though a quick table of contents
post would be appropriate.



 1. Post 1 - [[/post/cheating][Some general thoughts on cheating]]
 2. Post 2 - [[/post/cheatgpt/][Cheating with chatGPT]]
 3. Post 3 - [[/post/teachgpt/][Teaching with chatGPT]]
 4. Post 4 - [[/post/chatgpt-good-bad-ugly/][More teaching with chatGPT]]
 5. Post 5 - [[/post/chatgpt-in-cs-class/][chatGPT in a CS class]]

    
Back to new content soon.
