I was planning on either following up on how I use GitHub classroom or
commenting on the recent [[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/opinion/college-board-sat-ap.html%0A][NY Times opinion piece]] on the College Board
but the follow up, fall out, and polarization from the Amazon NY thing
has been stuck in my head so I thought I'd write a bit more about it.

Like my [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/no-amazon-hq/][previous post]], this isn't really about Amazon but rather about
the long game, equity, and diversity and how a lot of people are
fooling themselves.

It's interesting that the communities I'm in are fairly polarized - my
pure tech world frients are big time upset that the deal fell through while
my pure educator friends, particularly the public school ones, are
really happy things worked out the way they did.

The big disappointment from the tech side revolves largely around the
jobs lost. Lots of tech jobs no longer coming fast and furious. The problem is,
who's going to fill them. We've been hearing for years that there's a
tech talent problem. Every company at every meetup seems to say "oh,
and we're hiring," Google's expanding as are, as far as I can tell,
most of the other tech giants in the city. How can both be true? If we
need those new jobs now then there must be a glut of tech people
clamoring for employment. If indeed talent is hard to find, how will
NY be able to fill this new need. 

We all know the answer - import them. Companies that can have and will go to
the "elite" institutions around the country and try to recruit the
talent to NY. At the end of the day the politicians can look and say
"behold, I have taken this slum and transformed it into a paradise"
and that might technically be true. Problem is that they did it by
further marginalizing and displacing those already on the fringes. 

It's hard to see. When I was younger - before I was deeply immersed in
public education all I saw was the gentrification - look the
neighborhood has gotten better. Now I understand the cost. I'm reminded
of Hofstadter's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%25C3%25B6del,_Escher,_Bach][GEB]] where the anteater is friends with Aunt Hillary -
an ant colony and in fact was an ant surgeon. He "healed" the colony
through strategic amputations. The colony remained healthy but at the
cost of the individuals who didn't make the cut.

The only way all these high paying tech jobs are going to come from NY
if NY can generate them and the truth is, right now, we can't.

Colleges nation wide are dealing with capacity issues. At least one
dropped its CS minor - arguably more valuable than a CS major for may
students. Stories abound on how hard it is to attract faculty and in
NYC we also have to deal with real estate issues. At Hunter, we can't
just plop down a new building for CS even if we did have the money. 

This of course is not just a capacity issue but also a diversity and
equity one and too many players are rearranging the deck chairs on the
Titanic. Some tech players are making an honest effort to deal with
[[https://www.usv.com/blog/our-first-network-wide-diversity-inclusion-survey][diversity]] and equity in a meaningful way, too many aren't. I was
recently speaking with a friend at a big tech company. I was pitching
him on supporting what I'm building at Hunter. He said he really
wanted to help but his companies diversity plan, once you stripped
away the shiny paint was poaching from FANG (or is it FAAMG)
companies. The other thing I see is recruiting exclusively at "elite"
private schools and trying to grab as many "underserved" candidates as
possible. A third strategy involves counting everyone on your team for
diversity counts even if many of them aren't really tech. Of course
the elite colleges play the same game. When you've got an incoming
class of let's say 2000 and you've got 10 times that many applicants
with 4.0 GPAs and perfect test scores you can shape your class however
you want but it's a zero sum game and doesn't provide opportunity for
the masses.. 

If we want to solve these issues we have to deal with K12 and if
that's the case it's going to take at least 6 years maybe considerably
more before we really see results and that's assuming we fix the
college capacity issues.

This brings me to CS for all. I'm a big believer in CS for All and
I've dedicated a lot of time and energy on bringing quality CS
education to the have nots but CS for All might not be the
answer. First, many of us believe that it's not about turning everyone
into a software engineer. True, by exposing everyone to CS we'll get a
larger pool working towards that end but the intent isn't or at least
shouldn't be as a feeder into the tech industry. 

A bigger problem is ensuring that we indeed have quality CS for All
for all and that's a real concern. Looking over the landscape here's
what I'm seeing. Rich, well heeled schools are finding those few
really knowledgeable CS teachers and many of the poor schools are
getting quick and dirty training on some generic APCS-Principals
class. Dedicated hard working teachers who want to do a great job but
aren't being given the time and resources to really learn CS and CS
pedagogy.  Now APCS-P can be a strong class or a weak one but in many
cases by going for the quick fix with a scripted class and then saying
"we're done" is condemning those kids to sub standard CS. Even if
some do take CS1 in college my guess many will be underprepared and
many will drop. Even with a good APCS-P, the fact that no one is
paying attention to the complete pipeline and the transition from High
School to College and through the major will mean that we're going to
lose many of the kids along the way.

The answer? Good pre-service programs will help - that's why I'm so
bullish on the program we're developing at Hunter. A bad preservice
program, however - one that is based on "you take it you teach it"
won't prepare our teachers to prepare our kids. Even then, we're not
going to really solve the problem until we deal with little things
like, oh, you know, poverty. 

I might sound pessimistic. Maybe I am but it doesn't change
anything. I'm going to do my best to affect positive change in
whatever circles I can be they large or small and many others are
doing the same.

All those jobs that aren't coming to NY?  They'd have been filled
before any sensible fix to our NYC Tech pipeline problem yields fruit
anyway and would likely have displaced the current fringe population
rather than uplift them.
