* Keynote Marie de Jardin
- fillin
- Vision is what you think and you do it.
- Friedman saw in speaker "Someday you can be a dean provost etc" -
  what if you don't want to follow the the traditional path
- Design “launch” courses not “weeder” courses. (Of course, this is
  just good teaching).



* Mark's keynote
- If we teach CS in another subject can we teach enough?
- they need things and we build stuff.
- he said add to other areas like bootstrap does because it looks like
  algebra
  - he said we will take a step back before a step forward
    - what about how we already don't teach proof and testing pressurs
- partner with other departments - my comment out how about K12
  teachers and difficulties


* Blair Taylor
