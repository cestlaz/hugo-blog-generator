I was looking over my TRS statement the other day - that's Teacher's
Retirement System and noticed that next week I'll be starting my 32nd
year teaching. That's \(2^5\) or 10000 - 5 bits so I guess you can't
call me a two bit teacher.

Two and a half years at Seward, over 20 at Stuy, and the rest at
Hunter College. I've had a lot of last days before school starts but
this year is different. I'm betting that's the case for a lot of us.

I mentioned about burnout and not feeling any joy when I wrote about the
[[/post/no-csta2021/][CSTA conference]] but we're also starting a new year in a strange place
due to the pandemic. On the one hand we have vaccines but on the
other, we've got Delta. I'm scheduled to teach my undergraduate
classes in person and to be honest, I'm not 100% comfortable. Will
that affect my teaching? I guess we'll see.

Then we have practical concerns. My students should all be distancing
so how will that affect group work?

As I'm writing this I just got an email from Hunter saying that
students will have 45 days post FDA approval to get vaccinated. The
wording seems to contradict the previous policy that in order for
students to enter campus they had to be vaccinated. This is concerning
to say the least.

When I started teaching I was always nervous before the first day back
and then again for the first day teaching. Mid career it was more of
an excited nervousness. Ultimately the nerves went away and while I
sorely needed vacation in June by September I was looking forward to
seeing my students again. This year it's mostly nervousness, discomfort and
uncertainty. 

I don't write this merely to complain but rather to share. I figure if
I'm feeling this way so probably are others. We're not alone.  

I've got some CS and teaching content posts lined up and plan to start
with them next week as things get back in the swing but for now, good
luck to everyone starting back up.
