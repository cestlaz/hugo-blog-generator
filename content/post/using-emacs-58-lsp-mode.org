I've been wanting to check out [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][lsp-mode]] under Emacs for a while
now. LSP stands for [[https://langserver.org/][Language Protocol Service]]. The idea is that you
have a standard interface between your editor and some language
server. If you program in multiple languages and each has an LSP
server you end up, in theory, with a simpler configuration and a
consistent interface.

This certainly sounds more appealing than how we did it in the old
days where you have some ad hoc configuraiton for each language you
work in. At times I'm working or dabbling in a whole bunch of
languages. At times, my Emacs configuration has had separate sections
for each of the following languages:

- Emacs Lisp
- Python
- Java
- C and C++
- Clojure
- Processing
- Scheme
- Haskell
- Rust
- OCaml

and more. 

This can get messy.

So, LSP sounds cool but when I've tried to get it going in the past
I've always had troubles. This time, I tried a different approach. I
decided to declare .emacs.d bankruptcy. I cleared out my .emacs.d
directory and started fresh. Not really fresh - I copied over The
critical parts of my configuration to start with - Swiper, email and
org config and a few other things. Then I got lsp-mode working for
Python and C++. Now I'm going to migrate over more of my old
configuration as I discover I want, miss, or need things. We'll see
how it goes.

The new configuration can be found here:
