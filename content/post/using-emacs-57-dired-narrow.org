One of Emacs power features that I've never quite gotten into is
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]], the Directory Editor. I've already done a [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-38-dired/][video on the package]].
It's really cool and I do use it at times but I still haven't started
using it for my day to day.

Well, I just started using a couple of packages that might change
this. They're part of a set of dired addons that you can check out at the
[[https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks/tree/2c1234592aee91dcd9401bcd67213e6a4a464fd9][dired hacks]] page. The specific ones I'm talkign about are
~dired-subtree~ and ~dired-narrow~. ~dired-subtree~ is cool but it's
not the game changer. ~dired-narrow~ is. One of my issues with
dired is that I can't see all the files I'm operating on easily at the
same time. If I'm marking a large number of files to delete I want to
be able to see all of them at once so I'm sure I'm not making a
mistake. ~dired-narrow~ lets me easily do this.

Check out the video to see the details:
