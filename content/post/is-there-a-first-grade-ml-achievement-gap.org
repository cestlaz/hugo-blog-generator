Today was the fifth "To Code and Beyond" - a one day conference
hosted at Cornell Technion and once again Diane Levitt put together
a great show. The theme was Computational Thinking and the day
consisted of a variety of talks, panels, and activities. I plan on
writing about one panel in particular but for today I wanted to
address something that came up as a question. One attendee asked a
panel about the achievement gap - the fact that when the CS movement got
started in NY some of the more innovative and interesting work was
being done with some of our most vulnerable students. Recently, he
heard about a student who was doing Machine Learning in early
elementary school - first grade. The concern
he had was that when we started the less affluent populations might
have even been pulling ahead but now he's concerned that the gap
between have and have nots will continue to grow even in this new
field.
   
I'm not so concerned about the ML gap in the early grades and I
still think that we still have an opportunity to lessen the gap
between the haves and have nots with CS and more specifically CT.

I was reminded about when I started fencing. I first picked up a foil
in 11th grade. Stuy had a senior heavy team that year. I was the only
new junior and there were a bunch of new sophomores. The following
year, we were the starting lineup. We were raw but we still managed
second place in the city. Most of us continued on to fence in USFA
events and then in college. I remember one of the first events we went
to. It was the under 20 qualifiers for the Junior Olymbpics National
Championships. There were a couple of superstars who recently came
over from eastern bloc countries there. Also a bunch of
fencers we didn't know but we knew that they'd been fencing for
years - since they were 8, 9, 10. "They've been fencing for
years. We've only been doing it for one. How can we ever compete?"
I remember Jordan saying "Yeah, they've fenced for years but probably
a day or two a week, we've been doing it intensely every day for a
year and a half." He also noted that when they were in their early
years their bodies probably weren't coordinated enough to really
develop so much. He was right. The superstars dominated but then we
were very much in the mix and in fact took most of the qualifying
spots. 

I also thought about teaching CS at Stuy. There were always kid who
came in to class with prior experience. That was clear on day one and
for the first few weeks. By the end of the first semester you woudn't
know it based on overall class performance. The newcomers caught up
pretty quickly. 

This is why I' not really concerned when I hear about a school doing
Machine Learning in first grade. How much can they really do and how
deep is it? Is the kid even really ready for it or are they just going
through the motions? Or, are they just doing something they've always
done in first grade and are just labelling it ML.

I think that last option is fairly likely. It's also why I think we
still have an opportunity to close the achievement gap as part of the
CS / CT movement. 

When people ask me about CS in the early grades I first tell them that
I'm not an early grade specialist. I follow this by stating that I
think that well resourced schools have been doing thing that we now
consider CT for years - logic, problem solving, puzzles, etc.When a
group of students solve a problem and describe a solution that
includes repetition it used to be just problem solving. Now it's
computation thinking. Sure, we can tease it out, formalize it and
expand on it but the schools and teachers with the resources and
freedom have already been doing this. 

With the CS For All movement, we have an opportunity to bring this to
all our students not just the well to do ones.

Of course this is easier said than done. We have to prepare them to
identify these CT practices and actively develop these skills in their
students. This means giving teachers the time, resources, and training
and not shorten the already tight tether to standardized multiple
choice tests. 

At times I've been disappointed with the overall K12 CS Ed
movement. We've made great strides coming from nowhere to where we are
but as a community we missed the opportunity to bypass the mistakes
and bad ideas that teachers of other disciplines are plagued with. 
We still have this chance with Computational Thinking and the early
grades.

I hope we do it right.
