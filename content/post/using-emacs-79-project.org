One of the comments on my last video talked about the new project
management support Emacs includes in it's latest version -
project.el. I remembered reading about it when it rolled around but
then forgot and never checked it out.

Up until recently when working in projects I used [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]], a great
package by [[https://twitter.com/bbatsov][Bozhidar Batsov]], also known as Bug. I only used it when
doing development work - that's when I find myself jumping around
within a group of related files. At other times, I'm pretty much in
one file, do my thing, then move on.

I wrote a post and did a video on Projectile a while ago - you can
check it out [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-33-projectile-jump/
][here]].

As I mentioned in the last video, I decided to rebuild my Emacs config
from scratch and I'm trying to be a bit more minimalist so with that
reminder I got, I figure it's time to check out the now built in
project.el. If it's as good as projectile, or even, good enough, it
could be a nice alternative.

At it's core, project.el works similarly to projectile. There's a
prefix key an then an action which is restricted to your project. For
projectile, it was ~C-c p~ and the default for project.el is ~C-x
p~. No big difference there. Projectile seems to have many many more
options but in general, I find that all I need is

 - Switch to a project - ~C-x p p~
 - Find or open a file in a project - ~C-x p f~
 - Switch buffers in a project - ~C-x p b~
 - Delete all the project buffers - ~C-x p k~
 - List the project buffers

Project.el has all except listing all the buffers. It also supports a
few other features that I think I'll find useful:

 - project dired - ~C-x p d~
 - project shell (or eshell) ~C-x p s~
 - project regex search and variants ~C-x p g~
   
I'm not sure if projectile has these. It probably does and I could see
them being useful. I probable won't use the regex searches much
because I'll likely use other tools for those like consult-ripgrep.

So, it certainly seems like project.el has enough coverage for my
purposes. Another difference between the two projects is that
project.el only supports a couple of project definitions - things that
are supported by Emacs' VC system ad things supported by Emacs EDE
thing (which I've never really played with). I seem to recall
Projectile being more flexible.

In any event, project.el looks like it's a nice simple alternative at
least for me. Check out the video for the runthrough:
