There was a comment on my last post about [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/arbitrary-trees/][arbitary trees]] on Reddit
talking about how this type of data structure was a hold over from the
old days when computer resources were more limited. Nowadays having a
list of children makes more sense. The comment was of course correct
but I still think it's worth teaching representations like the one I
spoke of in my [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/arbitrary-trees/][last post]].
