I spent a couple of days last week hunkered down working designing a
CS Ethics course and of course it got me thinking about designing
courses in general. 

One of the topics I've ranted on is my disdain for canned
curricula. I've never been a fan. This isn't to say I don't want to
leverage other people's work. I'll take sample curricula, lessons, and
all the resources I can get my hands on but I'd never just deliver
them as is. Even back when I started as a math teacher and I had the
NYCDOE lesson plan books to use as samples, I'd use those lessons as
sources to develop my own.

I was reminded why I do this as I was developing my ethics course. I
want the course to have a significant amount of programming and for
some of the projects US census data and the NYC data mine look to be
good sources of data. I was led to these sources from some project
ideas I found online but those projects provided the data pre
processed. Had I been using these sources as a canned curriculum
things would be fine until something changed. Either the resource went
away or the direction of the class required something different. In
either event, had I been happy to merely use someone elses canned
materials I wouldn't be prepared.

It turns out that you've got to do some digging before you can
effectively use a resource like the US census data. Maybe you can use
the [[https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml%5D][American Fact Finder]]. With it you can download a refined data set
as a CSV but you'll still have to figure out how to use the tool and
which data sets you need. Another approach is to [[https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/data-via-ftp.html][download the data via
FTP]] but then you have to figure out how the files are arranged. 

All of this is to say that you can't just go to census.gov and
trivially get what you need and you certainly can't just send students
there and say "good luck." I spent more hours that I'd care to admit
last week figuring out the ins and outs of a variety of data sources
and I've got many more hours ahead. It's taking a lot of time but at
the end of the day, I'll own the knowledge. 

At the end of the day the first time you offer a course most of your
pre planning is going to go out the window. You need a framework, a
direction, and a start but first time through you don't know how or
where things will really go. If you're using someone else material,
good luck when things take an unexpected turn. If you own the course,
you'll be prepared.
