By living in Emacs I get a consistent interface across all sorts of
tasks - programming, lesson planning, making presentations, preparing
documents, and yes, even email. I've been using [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-39-mu4e/][mu4e]] as my Emacs email
client for a while now. Currently, I'm using Emacs for my work email
and Gmail for personal. I've been thinking of going whole hog to mu4e
and possibly migrating from Gmail to a new email provider for the
personal stuff but there are still a few pain points with Emacs email:

- rich text emails (embedded links, images, etc)
- calendar integration
- contacts 
- periodic Maildir sync problems with mbsync

Calendar integration isn't a make or break issue and contacts with
mu4e is good enough so that leaves two pain points. Formatted emails
which I think is now pretty much solved (see below) and the Maildir
stuff.

On the Maildir side, I'm trying deal with my email across four
machines - work laptop, work desktop, home laptop, home desktop. I
originally synced each one separately and that worked but I was having
archive problems - it seems that I was only archiving on the local
machine so if I archived an email at work and I needed to get to it at
home, I was out of luck. 

Then, I moved to sharing my Maildir using Syncthing - an opensource
Dropbox-alike. That mostly worked but if I wasn't careful I'd get
syncing errors where I have to go into my Maildir directory and
manually rename or remove messages - a real pain.

If anyone out there has a solution (and [[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/fixing-duplicate-uid-errors-when-using-mbsync-and-mu4e/][this]] fix doesn't fully work
for me), I'd love to hear about it.

Let's get back to the formatted email. I was already to create an
email in org mode using ~org-mu4e-compose-org-mode~ which I think is
built in to either org-mode or mu4e but it's limited. It formats
tables, outlines, and source blocks but I can't easily make a source
block for something like *dot* or *ditaa* and embed the result. I
found a solution recently. It's [[https://github.com/jeremy-compostella/org-msg][org-msg]] - a terrific package that lets
you compose an email in org-mode. It seems to have better support than
org-mu4e-compose-org-mode. It does the basic formatting, tables, etc
and also executes source blocks. The only thing that was missing for
me was LaTeX formatting but I use that so rarely I don't really care.

The package author, Jeremy Compostella, is also very responsive. When
I first installed org-msg it wasn't integrating seamlessly with
mu4e. It was still workable but I had to manually insert some
configuration at the top of all my emails. I opened an issue on this
and within a day it was fixed.

It also has a very cool preview mode so you can see what you're
sending. On that, though, I did have an issue but I'm pretty sure it's
an Emacs / org-mode issue and not an org-msg issue. On my desktop,
when I run the preview, it opens my browser with the email formatted
correctly. When I do the same on my laptop, it runs GitHub Classroom
Assistant - an application I installed and use for other
purposes. I've had this happen before with other emacs xdg things. If
anyone else has seen this and better has a solution, I'd love to hear
about that as well.

Anyway, here's a video that shows org-msg in action:
