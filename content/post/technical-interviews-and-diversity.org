I recently stumbled upon [[https://twitter.com/laurieontech/with_replies][Laurie Barth]] on Twitter and noticed a couple
of tweets about tech interviews and the hiring process, something I've
been thinking about recently.

  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Solid rant. I
think the teach to the programming test market already exists. And
it’s why interviewers who subscribe to these tactics get upset if a
candidate admits they’ve seen the problem previously. Because it ruins
the illusion that this is revealing how candidates think. <a

I guess I've been thinking about it because I'm teaching a section of
Data Structures which, along with Algorithms, provides the base
knowledge you need to have a shot at the typical "Google Style"
technical interview.

I say "base knowledge" because just completing those two classes
doesn't really prepare you. It gives you the building blocks but you
really have to prep specifically for the types of questions they might
give you. Unfortunately, for most kids it involves a whole lot of
rejection and failure before you start getting offers. 

You might get a problem that has a bad brute force solution and during
the relatively short interview, devoid of your typical resources and
comforts you have to turn it into a much more efficient one. The
argument is that the interviewer is really trying to see how you think
about a problem but having spoken to many, many tech employees who do these
interviews that's a specious argument at best. It's really a test of
"who has seen the problem or something similar before but can fake
that they haven't the best." 

While it's true that you will get some candidates who can solve the
problems on the spot you're going to miss out on a whole bunch of
great candidates who just don't do well on that "Google style" of
interview. At the same time we keep hearing that, as Laurie tweeted,
the skills required on the job don't match the ones needed to pass the
interview. 

This doesn't really matter to the big, hot companies. The Googles and
Facebooks of the world. So many students coming out of college want to
work for them that they can afford to miss on tons of great candidates
so long as they hit on enough good ones. 

I put the word "diversity" in the title of this post and you might
wonder what I was going for there. So far, I'm just ranting about the
interview process. This becomes a diversity and privilige issue
because the process favors "elite" CS schools with established CS
cultures. I'm not talking about the fact that they pre-select high
performing candidates nor the fact that all the tech companies go to
those schools, sometimes exclusively for recruiting. I'm talking about
how the school's student tech culture helps prepare the students for
the technical interview. 

From my discussions with many graduates from many of these institutions, while
classes don't prep for interviews, students at these CS schools
regularly share interview questions. Friends and classmates talk about
the questions they got and help each other out with practice
sessions - formal or otherwise. I'm certainly not faulting students
for doing this but it's another known  secret. We all know that the
more tech interview questions you see the better prepared you'll be -
both because you'll get better at that specific problem solving skill
and also because you'll likely get interview questions that are
already in your library. It's that latter part that makes the whole
process very nod, nod, wink wink. 

Nothing stops other students at other schools from doing similar but
it's much harder at a commuter school where kids live off campus and
have to work part time jobs. It's the reason I'm fighting so hard for
space and working on building a postitive tech culture at Hunter. Not
specifically for interviews but to help my students become a support
network for each other.

I'll finish by noting that while this "technical interview" process
might more or less work for the big boys - the hot company du jour, it
probably doesn't for eveyrone else. A buddy of mine was talking to me
about the process he uses at his much smaller company. He noted that
he could use the "Google interview" process for his future employees
but since his company was much smaller and lesser known, people who
did well would probably also get offers from the big boys and go work
for them. His goal was to come up with a process that catches the
great candidates that *don't* do well on the Google interview to try
to catch the great talent that doesn't do well on today's technical
interviews. A number of smaller companies seem to be starting to do
this and from the few I've spoken to it seems to be going well.

I get that big companies are machines and look for uniformity in all
processes including the interview process but there has to be a
better, more human way to evaluate talent than a one size fits all
process where the norm is failure - particularly when it seldom
relates to actual skills needed on the job.
