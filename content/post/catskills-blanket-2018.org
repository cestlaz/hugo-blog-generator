Two weekends ago I took a group of my first year students up to
[[http://catskillsconf.com][Catskills Conf]], an annual event that I describe as "light tech
conference with a focus on diversity and inclusion meets summer camp."
I've [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/catskills-2017/][written about]] the event before if anyone's interested in more
details. As in past years, Devorah ran her [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/knitting-tech-conference/][knitting for good]]
project. In each of the first two years of the project, attendees of
Catskills Conf learned how to know and collectively knit, crocheted
and assembled a blanket for Project Linux which provides hand made
blankets to children in crisis.

This year we made two:

While I was off this morning [[https://twitter.com/diane_levitt/status/1056560530956214272][talking]] to high school students at
Cornell Technion, Devorah was finishing off the blankets and
delivering them.

In past years, the blanket was usually mostly made by a small handful
of experienced knitters who attended the conference. This year was
very different. For the first time, many of my students took part in
the project.

A few already knew how to know but more were learning for the first
time.

I love that were at a tech conference and at the same time learning to
be creative with our hands and all the while doing some good for
others.


Already looking forward to next year.
