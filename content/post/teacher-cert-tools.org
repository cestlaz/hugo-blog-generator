Our summer intensive was supposed to be in person but COVID-19 changed
that in a hurry. We had to scramble to redesign and figure out how we
were going to run things.

We decided to go with the following:

- Zoom for live meetings 
- Slack for chat
- Git and GitHub
  - GitHub classroom for assignments 
  - GitHub repos for code distribution, class website and resource
    sharing. 
  - GitHub discussions for off hour and long form discussion

While Zoom is a great platform it was lacking in a few areas so we
also ended up using: 

- [[https://padlet.com][Padlet]] as a collaborative writing space for groups
- Assorted whiteboarding tools.

Here's the breakdown.

We used Zoom as you might imagine - big zoom for direct instruction
and whole class work and lots of breakout rooms. Screen sharing worked
great but the whiteboarding was less than ideal so we turned to screen
sharing with other tools. The big things missing from Zoom were a
collaborative writing/drawing space and flexibility for breakout
rooms. I would have loved to be able to spy on a breakout room or have
more fluidity between them but it still did a pretty good job
considering Zoom wasn't designed for education. 

[[https://bigbluebutton.org/][Big Blue Button]] is an open source alternative to Zoom. It's design for
teaching so it has some of the features that Zoom lacks but it's not
quite there yet in terms of quality and reliability.

Instead of the Zoom chat, we decided to use Slack. Zoom's chat only
works while Zoom is up and there were times when the cohort was
working "offline." Also, slack gave us both threads and different
channels as well as arbitrary private chats. 

In addition to the general class chat we had channels like #git-fu, #java-fu, #fall-is-coming to discuss COVID-19 and the public schools,
#attendance  and a bunch of others. 

Funny thing - this was the first time any of us had strong Slack
adoption. We've tried it before but never got buy in. This time we
did. Maybe because we were together morning through afternoon and when
we broke we were still in the same physical location with out
computers nearby. In any event, Slack was used for both in class and
out of class communication and is still being used now albeit at a
lower volume. 

Slack also gave us a place, besides the zoom to build
community. Having some fun channels like #duckygram and #cs-educationy-goodness  set a light tone. Every day, Alex would wait
until right before our start to put a gif in the #attendance channel
each day outdoing the ridiculousness of the rest of the class. It was
the cohort that made the community but Slack as a platform helped.

I'm wondering if a I'll get better buy in with my undergrads in a few
weeks as we're starting the semester online but at least for this
cohort, it worked.

My only problem with Slack is the price. I have zero budget which
leaves us with the free tier. That means limited integrations  and
limited history. I might check out some self-hosted options like Zulip
and Rocketchat to see if they're viable alternatives.

We originally planned to use GitHub discussions for longer form
communication. It hit most of the buttons for me -- threaded
discussion, reply via email, customizable alerts. All good. It's
lacking tags and search but it looked like it could be a viable long
form discussion platform. We kicked off with it but the class voted
with their feet. They kept going back to Slack so while GitHub was our
main platform for code, GitHub discussions fell by the wayside as
Slack won the day.

Along the way we learned some tricks. Even though Topher was paid for
teaching two courses, JonAlf two, and I was just officially
supervising and coordinating, all three of us were pretty much on all
the time. Ones strategy that developed was having one of us man Slack
while another ran the Zoom. I might be running a Zoom based activity
while Topher or JonAlf would answer questions or highlight and
emphasize key points on Slack. I don't know yet if it helped the class
educationally or was a distraction but we all liked the
flow. Something to look at further. 

We also had to figure out how not to double or triple respond to
questions. We each adopted an emoji and when a question was asked,
whoever got there first would mark the thread with that emoji letting
the others know we had it covered. 

Another skill we mastered was the "slack-moji" poll - pre-staging
Slack polls and content to cut and paste over. Actually, there's a
cool remote class tool, [[https://prismia.chat/][Primsia]] (formerly babylon.hosue) which is much
better at that than Slack but it isn't up 24x7 and is more set up for
a teacher actively managing class discussion rather than a free form
chat.

I'd love to see Big Blue Button grow to be a suitable Zoom replacement
as it's better suited for education and I'm hoping that Zulip proves
to be a good free alternative to Slack but regardless of specific
tool, the combination of video conferencing, chat, long form message,
and whiteboarding make up a pretty good remote classroom. It would be
nice if collaborative coding was easier but there aren't that many
options there. [[https://repl.it][Repl.it]] is awesome but we decided to have them develop
on their local machines and adding a tool like [[https://floobits.com/][Floobits]] would have
been too much to ask for most of the cohort. 

We think it all went pretty well. If given the option next summer, I'm
leaning towards a hybrid program as even without COVID-19, remote is
easier for many teachers for geographic and school scheduling
reasons. I figure open in person and maybe do one day or a couple of
half days a week on site and the rest remote. I think we'll talk about
it as a cohort once the Fall begins and can start thinking about
cohort 2.
