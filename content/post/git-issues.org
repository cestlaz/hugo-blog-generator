Last week I talked about using [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/communicating-with_students/][GitHub issues]] as a mechanism for class
communication. I thought it might be helpful to follow up on it and
also felt that a video would be better than text.

So, here it is, 16 minutes on how you can use GitHub issues for class
communication. I don't show examples of everything like @ tagging but
I think it shows some of the power of using GitHub and GitHub
classroom beyond just a software repo and versioning.

Enjoy.
