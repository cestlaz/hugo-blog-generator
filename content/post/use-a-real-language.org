#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Why can't we use a real language!
#+END_QUOTE

This topic has been coming up a lot recently. Now I'm not talking
about the Drag and drop vs textual language thing. Let me be clear. To
me a Drag and Drop language can certainly be a real language and many
are. I also think they're terrific when used correctly. I just think
they're frequently misapplied in later grades. 

No, I'm talking about people asking things like "Why do we have to use
Java in our class, why can't we use a real language like ______." Or
at Hunter, I might get "Why do we have to use C++, why can't we use
Java." Back at Stuy I'd get the same question about Scheme and
Netlogo. It actually doesn't really matter what language you
use. Someone else, usually a non-teacher always knows better.

All of this reminded me of when I was young. 

I started with BASIC and then in high school programmed Fortran IV
using punch cards on an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1130][IBM 1130]]. At the time BASIC was considered a
toy language and Fortran IV not to mention punch cards were
yesterday's technology. I also took APCS the first year it was offered
and that's where I learned Pascal.

I then went to NYU - The Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. There
we also used Pascal as the core language. That was the language used
in CS1, Data Structures, and Algorithms. It was also the default
language for other classes. That is, unless the class lent itself to
a specific language such as Lisp for AI you'd probably use
Pascal. I learned C early on in my college career and also took
classes that used Ada, and 8088 Assembly. I mostly tried to stick with
C. It was the hot language at the time and all the cool kids were
using it. Some kids continued to use Pascal but it was universally
derided. It wasn't a "real language." Nobody used it for anything
serious.

Senior year it was time to look for a job. I ended up going  to
Goldman Sachs and developed for PCs running Windows 2.1 in C. They
also hired a bunch of college grads to program the Stratus systems in
PL1 and Cobol programmers for the mainframes. This was
around 1989. Goldman and most other big companies started you in a
training program. I already knew C but they ran a crash course for my
group. They did the same for the Cobol kids although most of them had
learned it in their business schools. The PL1 kids were grouped in
with the C and Cobol groups and had to figure out PL1 on their own
once they were assigned teams.

My story tough, isn't about Goldman. It's about another big bank I
interviewed with. I won't name them but it's a big firm that still
exists today. I think they had at least a whole big building down on
the street back when I interviewed but I don't remember. The interview
process was tough and thorough. We talked about the firm, what they
did, the platforms they developed and of course they drilled me on
what I brought to the table. The funny thing was that their entire
PC platform was built in, yep, you guessed it, Turbo Pascal. 

Here was a really respected financial firm doing really interesting
tech and they were using that fake toy language that no kid would ever
use for real.

So there you have it. All this "it's not a real language" stuff is
largely nonsense. If it can solve your problem it's real. If it can
teach your concept it's real. The rest is nonsense.

As a side note, my first programming gig was in the mid 1980s for a
ticket printing company - Arcus Simplex Brown. I worked on a computer
ticket printing system for them. It was in BASIC and ran on a little
PC running CP/M with a big line printer. Best I could figure they were
still using the same system in 2012.

So, don't get caught up with someone else's opinion of what's a real
language just make sure your students are getting what they need.
