So, in some of the social platform discussion on my [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/new-major/][last post]], the
issue of the practicality of a college education came up. Should
college teach practical job skills or should it be for some more
abstract purpose - learning for learning sake or if one would be a bit
presumptions learning how to think.

Way back when going to college was not the norm. Most went from HS to
workforce and even in HS you might have the "academic" track that
prepared you for college, "vocational" that was job prep like
automotive or regular which was neither extreme. Sure, that system had
a host of problems but since the end goal wasn't college for most, it
freed college from the need for being practical. College could just be
about learning non-useful stuff.

Nowadays kids don't have the luxury of not going to college. It's
expected in our society. Spend 4 years and oodles of dollars to get
the piece of paper and you can get a job that years ago only required
the HS version of the paper.

This, of course, leads to many rather large and hairy questions none
of which I will address here.

What I will address concerns my little CS corner of the world.

In commenting on my post, some people talked about college faculty
they know and how those faculty members refuse to teach or use
anything that might remotely be useful to kids in terms of
career. They feel it's beneath them and that they serve a higher
academic purpose. I don't doubt those comments - I know plenty of
college faculty who feel this very way.

I'll agree that college shouldn't strictly be a jobs program but the
nice thing about CS is that you *can* teach practical skills and job
skills within the context of a traditional academic CS degree. Add in
the reality that most CS majors don't want to go to grad school and
you can redesign the major to do even more for the majority of
students.

How about programming languages and tools. Why not use a couple of
practical ones. This is not to say that the first language has to be
C++, Java, Python or similar but there's no reason why a couple practical
languages shouldn't be used. Sure, feel free  to use an esoteric
language or some professors pet project in a particular class and by
all means use the intro language that makes the most sense for your
situation but for a 4 year major, there's no reason why students
shouldn't walk away with a couple of languages that are widely used in
industry. Same for build tools and things like testing frameworks. I
use git and [[https://github.com/doctest/doctest][doctest]]. I'm not teaching a class in git or doctest, I'm
teaching software engineering techniques and testing as part of my CS1
classes. I have to use some tool as the platform on which to teach
these things so why not tools that they can also use outside of
school. It just makes sense. Sure, in terms of language, most colleges
seem to cover at least one of C++, Python, and Java but lag in terms
of the support concepts and tooling.


It reminds me about what I said in my earlier post about Intel
Assembly. At Stuy back in the 90s I taught a systems elective. It
wasn't a programming course about Intel assembly. If it was, I'd just
do a bunch of random programming assignments in it. It was rather a
course about how the computer worked at a low level and we *used*
Intel assembly as the tool.

You can't do this everywhere in a CS curriculum but there are plenty
of places where you can. Do this, make sure there are some required
large project courses where students can learn to work in a group and
integrate technologies, introduce a couple of new electives, and all
of a sudden you can have a strong academic CS program that also does a
great job preparing students for the tech world beyond academia.

Some places are already doing this and others are trying but too many
are still caught in the past.
