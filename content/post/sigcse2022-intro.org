I've been up in Providence RI since this past Wednesday for
SIGCSE2022. The big Computer Science Educators conference. Also, my
first in person conference since pre-covid.

I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about this big in person
gathering but as it's turned out, it's been pretty comfortable.

So far, I've attended two terrific keynotes. One by Barbara
Liskov and the other Barbara Ericson, some really interesting sessions
and some less interesting ones and have had a great time discussing CS
education.

The big highlight has been seeing friends in person and being able to
talk. Sitting down for coffee with a friend or having a rount table
discussion around a well, round table.

One of those friends I was delighted to see was Alfred
Thompson. Alfred's already sumarized his [[https://blog.acthompson.net/2022/03/sigcse-2022-day-1.html][first]] and [[https://blog.acthompson.net/2022/03/sigcse-2022-day-2.html][second]] day
experiences so there's not reason for me to write much the same so I
figured I'd just quickly list out a few of my highlights and in
particular things I plan to write more about when I get back to NYC.

- Language choice for APCS. There was a panel that considered why
  change to Python or why stick with Java. I didn't attend this
  session but talked at length about it with a number of people. It
  had me reconsidering my opinions and I'll certainly write about this
  in the near future.

- I saw an interesting talk by Sam Lau in which he discussed how
  statisticians and computer scientists differed in their views as to
  how and what should be taught in a data science course. This got me
  thinking about developing CS offerings at the high school level.

- I attended the "It seemed like a good idea at the time" session for
  the first time where teachers discussed their failures. This was a
  *great* session hosted by two more friends I haven't seen since
  pre-covid - Dan Garcia and Jim Huggins. One topic brought up there
  was dealing with late assignments as well as alternative
  grading. This too is something I plan to write about.

- PD For CS Teachers and teacher prep programs. This is clearly
  something I care deeply about and there were some sessions on this.

- I also spent a good amount of time catching up with my friends Jim
  and Robin from Siena College. They're doing some cool thing up there
  so that's another thing I'd like to write about.

- I also had some good discussions with vendors in the exhibit hall as
  well as some great hallway tract talks.

- My thoughts on the hybrid format of this conference

That's a big list - a lot of things to write about. I hope to get on
this when I get back to NYC on Sunday.

In the meantime, if you're in providence for tomorrow's last day of
SIGCSE, please find me and say hello!!!!
