With ISTE ending, the next big event for CS treachers is the annual
[[https://www.csteachers.org/page/2019conference][CSTA Conference]]. I first attended two years ago in Baltimore. Last
year the conference, in Omaha was bigger and better in every way
imaginable. I expect this year to be the best yet.

I don't go to a lot of conferences so I don't have much to compare
CSTA with but I like the fact that it's is about half the size of
SIGCSE. At about 1000 attendees it still feels small enough to be
intimate but at the same time large enough so that there's something
for everyone and plenty of people to learn and share from and with.

Just like last year, I'll be spending a lot of time at the GitHub
booth so if you want to talk about how to use GitHub to support your
students make sure to stop by and say hello.

I'll also be giving a session with my long time partner in crime
JonAlf. 

Most of us know that Git is a version control system and that
GitHub is pretty much the industry standard platform for using
Git. Many of us also know that GitHub for Education has a great
toolset to support using GitHub with your classes. Tools that help
organize, distribute, collect, and assess assignments.

Fewer people know that GitHub can be used to really easily create a
web presence and as a way to distribute class material and you don't
even have to use the command line if you don't want to. I use GitHub
as a lightweight CMS with my classes, to host full blown web sites,
and also to host this blog.

Come join JonAlf and me on Tuesday at 11:15 in West 106C and we'll
show you how you can use GitHub as a web presence as well.

I also want to briefly mention that my better half, Devorah, is going
to be with us at the GitHub booth running a really cool
knitting/crocheting for  charity project (thanks to both CSTA and
GitHub for facilitating this). I'll write more about it in a day or so
but if you're going to be at CSTA2019 and you knit or crochet or want
to learn, you can check the project out here:
[[http://blanketstatementproject.com/][http://blanketstatementproject.com/]] (note that the site is hosted on
GitHub and the source is [[https://github.com/blanketstatementproject/blanketstatementproject.github.io][here]]). 

GitHub is also holding a pre-conference reception on July 7 from
5:30 - 8:00. You can sign up [[https://csta-github-meetup.confetti.events/][here]]. 

Hope to see many of you in a couple of weeks in Phoenix.
