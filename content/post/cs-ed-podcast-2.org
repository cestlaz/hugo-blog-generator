Episode 2 of the CS Ed podcast had Dan Garcia talk about
exam creation. 


* Dan Garcia
if all his kids fail it's on him
** Mult choice tests
- likes multiple choice now with good distractors
- to me distractors are like "gotcha" questions
- bad way to cope with bad situation of large lecture classes
** Time to make test
12 hours
** Time to take test
1/6
- I think average student should finsh with time
** Test stuff
- just ask what to do - not a big story -test what you test
- ask a twist on last test (spiraling)
- do they get the general idea
- point values based on what was covered and how much
- exam morale - tell them it's the hard question
- easy to grade
- use gradescope
- the idea of group exams - or give xam then give back and have group
  do it. like cooperative learning
- give exams on computers
** My notes
- flow of test easy to hard
- not all or nothing questions
