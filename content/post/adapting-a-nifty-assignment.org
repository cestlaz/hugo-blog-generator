The [[http://nifty.stanford.edu/][Nifty Assignments]] session at SGICSE is always a popular one.

Go to [[http://nifty.stanford.edu/][the site]] and you'll find links to all the assignments presented
from 1999 to the present year.

On the one hand, it's a great resource. On the other, the assignments
vary in nifty-ness depending on one's personal taste. To me, there
seemed to be a run of nifty assignments that were really just "take a
generic assignment and fancy up the graphics" mixed in with one's that
I found really cool. There's also no way to really tell if an
assignment scratches your fancy without clicking through and reading
all of them.

I thought I'd talk about one of the assignments presented at this past
SIGCSE. I don't think I'll have an opportunity to use it directly but
I did find it pretty nifty. I also thought I'd share some tweaks I'd
consider if I were to use it.

The assignment is Jeffrey L. Popyack's [[http://nifty.stanford.edu/2019/popyack-nifty-post-it/][Post-It Pandemoniim]] assignment.

At first glance, or rather at the start of the presentation it seemed
a pretty lightweight assignment - kids make a pixelated image by
putting colored postit notes on a grid. That's a simple, nice
intro to 2D arrays but not all that nifty. The nifty part came when
you drilled down into the details. 

The assignment starts with a GIF image. First you process it  with a program
provided hich produces sheets describing a 3x5 section of the overall
image. These sheets are ultimately distributed to the students
perofming the activity. This still doesn't sound tremendously deep but
the activity also lets you talk about file formats with color
palettes. The idea that instead of storing the rgb triple for each
pixel you store an index into a palette of 256 colors that's also
embedded into the file. This is a great way to introduce indirect
lookups. Another feature Poplyack spoke about was compression. He
mentioned the project lending itself to Run Length Encoding. The idea
that if the image has a run of adjacent pixels of the same color,
let's say 9 reds in a row, instead of encoding them as "RRRRRRRRR" you
would use something like "9R." Add this all together and it's pretty
nifty. 

I did have a problem, though with the compression part. During the
talk, Poplyack talked about Run Length Encoding which is pretty simple
and approachable to beginners. GIF, however, as far as I know uses
Lempel-Ziv compression which is much more complex.

If I were to use this assignment, I'd probable make a few changes. I'm
not sure which of the following I'd actually do but here's what I
would think about.

First I would consider using the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format][NetPBM]] formats. Some of these formats
are simple ASCII. You can see some examples on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format][Wikipedia]]
page. This lets them go directly from the file to the poster. You also
have binary encoded versions of the format which adds a layer of
complexity if desired.

The second thing I would consider is using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCX][PCX]] files instead of
GIFs. PCX is a pretty simple format. It uses a color palette and also
RLE compression so while it's no longer as well known as GIF I think
it might present a more accessible way of getting to a format with Run
Length Encoding and a palette.

I'm not sure of the exact direction I'd go in with this assignment but
these are the additional things I'd think about. It's pretty nifty as
is but as with a lot of nifty assignments, part of the fun is
customizing it for your situation.
