So I'm teaching my Ethics and CS class for the first time. I
originally designed the course but didn't teach it the first time
around. That honor went to my friend, Master Teacher Topher
Mykolyk. He of course did an amazing job - impossible to
follow. Fortunately, this is a different cohort so they don't know how
great Topher was for the course :-).

Even though I have the syllabus and Topher's notes from last time
around, first time through is very week to week but I think I'm
starting to get my legs under me. 

This course is very different from what I've taught in the past. It's
also  different from the ethics courses I've seen currently out
there. Specifically, I wanted a programming component in the
course. Still, there's a lot more open ended discussion and opinion
based stuff going on.

I mean, when you do a class on an algorithm like mergesort or a
construct like a loop, it is what it is. You can motivate it in
different ways and engage the class but there's only one punch line
and it's set in advance. Here things are a lot looser. Most issues
have two sides and even when most of the class is on one like when we
talked about predictive policing, we can still
effectively play devil's advocate for the other side. 

It can also lead to the class going sideways. Yesterday we were
talking about basic web privacy. Tracking, cookies and the like. In my
mind I had the lesson mapped out. First, our "weekly ethicacy" student
presentation and then a short breakout, discussion on the info we
share, and then curated questions and resources  that we'd use in a
sequence of breakout room and whole class discussions. The trouble is,
after the first short breakout, the student conversation went directly
to what I had intended for our async work over the course of the
week. Oh well, time to [[/post/audible/][call an audible]]. It wasn't really a big deal,
the conversation moved in a different direction but it was still very
much in the wheelhouse of the day's topic.

Must be what an English class can be like.

It was fun.

Overall I think the course is doing well but I won't know for sure
until afterwards when I can debrief with the students. After all,
they're the ones that ultimately determine if the class is successful. 

Over the next few weeks I'll share some specifics about the class. The
programming stuff in particular. Can't do that now because we're in
the middle and I don't want any members of the class who might be
reading this to see the reveal before it's time.
