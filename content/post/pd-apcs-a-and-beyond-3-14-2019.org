Back in December we ran our first [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pd-apcs-a-and-beyond/][PD session for CS teachers]]. This was
to address the need for professional development for teachers who were
more experienced in terms of computer science - we aimed this at people who were ready to
teach APCS-A, similar, or beyond and also to start to build a
community for these teachers. 

We had trouble setting things up for February but we're good to go for
March, April and May.

Just as with our first session, each session will consist of a content
piece, a pedagogy piece, and will overall be driven by the
participants.

The next session is set for Thursday, March 14 from 5:00 - 8:00 and
will be hosted by Digital Ocean. The sessions will earn you 3 CTLE
hours and dinner will be provided.

If you or a CS teacher you know is interested in this, they can sign
