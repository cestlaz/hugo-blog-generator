many have struggled to use Twitter for discussion. How about Twitter
for broadcasting, but when replies turn to discussion, we use <a

I'd love to see more traffic [[https://reddit.com/r/CSEducation][there]]. For full disclosure, I'm one of
the moderators but in my defense, I'm not much of a moderator and as
[[https://twitter.com/AustinCorgiBart/status/1230992957467168768][Cory]] said, I too am happy to either keep moderating or to step aside.

Twitter is nice for broadcasting but not great for
meaty discussions. The character limit does make you think out what
you're saying but it's also a headache and tweet storms are an
inelegant solution at best. Once you start mixing in replies threads
become hard to follow. 

An interesting case study of Twitter conversation is over at [[https://twitter.com/home][Fred
Wilson]]'s blog  [[https://avc.com][AVC]]. Fred recently rebooted his long standing blog and
is now using Twitter for comments whereas he previously used [[https://disqus.com][Disqus]].
I haven't done an in depth analysis but there appears to be far fewer
comments and less in depth conversation than in his blogs past
incarnations. This could just be my perceptions but given the large
readership, it might be an interesting thing to analyze.

As to other communication tools, I've written about them with respect
to classroom communications [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/class-communications/][here]] and [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/communicating-with_students/][here]]. Many of the same issues
exist for using these tools as a professional community.

Facebook groups are private, undiscoverable, hard to search, and
scattered. They also exist in the Facebook silo. Data goes in but it
never comes out. I also can't access those Facebook groups using
anything other than Facebook.

Email is a great default. Nowhere else to go - things just show up in
your inbox. I'm on the APCS mailing list as well as SIGCSE. One
problem is the no quoting policy which makes threads hard to follow
and discoverability and long term searchability are a problem.

Slack? Just no.

So let's think about reddit. 

You can go to the site to read it but you can also subscribe using an
RSS/Atom reader like Feedly. If you post a comment you get replies via
email and an alert in reddit. It's discoverable, public, and
searchable. It even appears to support chats and a wiki.  Hits all the
buttons for me.

We could do a better job with the subreddit - add resource links to
the sidebar for instance - I just started to do that now. 

My friend [[https://twitter.com/cscheerleader/status/1231177418708267008][Ria]] commented on how she wasn't happy that people could post
anonymously. I tend to agree with her - I've always used my real
identity in forums and would prefer others do the same but that's not
a dealbreaker to me. I'd rather an open community with anonymous
posting allowed than Zuck's world.

Another issue that is sure to be raised is openness. Some teachers
don't want their discussions public where students can find
them. Sometimes this is to separate class from life and sometimes
because class related issues are being discussed. I've never had an
issue with this. Having spent close to 30 years in the classroom I've
always been pretty open and public. Sure, sometimes a student can find
an old assignment or blog post going over something but so what, maybe
they'll learn something. The only time I see this as really being an
issue is that you don't want to talk about specific student issues in
a public forum to protect the students privacy. It's harder to ask
your colleagues for help with some specific student related problem.

Now, much of what I'm guessing Amy was talking about was the CS
Educator type discourse that doesn't get into those weeds but I see
these communities as for all educators (which I'm sure Amy does as
well, just separating my read on her specific tweet).
