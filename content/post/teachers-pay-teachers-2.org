Now, to the report. I read over the executive summary and skimmed the
report.  To quote it 'Overall, reviewers rate most of the materials as
“mediocre” or “probably not worth using”.' The report also didn't seem
to show that either the private or public resources were consistently
superior.

Going further the report talks about the materials shortcomings in
terms of standards alignment, culteral diversity, assessments and a
handful of other buzzword items. 

The one thing I'll agree on between the article and report is when
they say that all of these resources "need a consolidated rating
system akin to Rotten Tomatoes."  Beyond that, I think both the
article and report are of little value. 

In the CS Educatio space there's a good amount of sharing of materials
as well as providers well, providing content. Some is free some not
but there is a lot available.
