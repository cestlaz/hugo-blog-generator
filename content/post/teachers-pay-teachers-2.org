Continuing from yesterday, what about the [[https://www.govtech.com/computing/Report-Most-Teacher-Created-Online-English-Materials-Subpar.html][article]] and [[https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/research/supplemental-curriculum-bazaar][report]] on pay
and free teacher resources.

The report looked at three sources - one pay and two free. They came
up with a number of results but I think they largely missed the point.

Their bottom line conclusion was that 'Overall, reviewers rate most
of the materials as “mediocre” or “probably not worth using”.' They
also didn't seem to find that neither the for profit or free sources
were universally better.

The one thing I can agree with though is that a consistent rating
system for the types of resources found on these sites would be very
helpful.

I think the main problem with the report has to do with what they were
looking for. They concluded things like the resources didn't line up
well with standards, didn't have good assessments, didn't address
cultural diversity and a few other "didn't dos,"  As I said, I think they
missed the point.

It felt to me that the reviewers were looking for rote
experiences. Download a lesson and follow the script.

In spite of what reformers would have you think, this isn't
teaching. A teacher new to a class might start with a well worked out
curriculum and largely follow it verbatim but as they develop their
chops they'll want the curriculum and all related materials to become
their own.

A downloaded resource, taken as is, will likely not address a specific
classes cultural diversity, at least not more than in the general
sense because it was designed for the authors class and that's a good
thing. It's up to the person doing the downloading to take the
resource and then adapt it for their students in their situation. This
is why most of the items that the report considers bad to me are both
inevitable and fine. There is no universal lesson that you can cut and
paste to all schools. To expect it is rubbish.


On the CS side, there's a good amount of sharing of materials as well
as providers well, providing content. Some is free some not but there
is a lot available. Forgetting about whole curricula resources, three
lesson / experience sites  I'm
reasonably familiar with are the SIGCSE [[http://nifty.stanford.edu/][Nifty Assignments]] and now the
CSTA's [[https://sites.google.com/site/cstaniftyassignments/][corresponding project]] along with [[https://www.engage-csedu.org/][Engage CS]].

The biggest problem with the Nifty sites is that they're arranged
chronologically by the conference year they were presented. There are
no tags nor easy way to search.  Engage CS gives you some level of
searching like for course level, keyword, resource type, and more.

Both sites claim to have their own format that's common to all
submissions but that's really not the case. They'll all have the same
sections but the way each section is written up is up to the author.

To me, that's not a problem. Each resource was written by some
educator with the intent of sharing but since each author is unique so
to will be the content they produce. 

The real value of all these resources are to get ideas - lesson
motivations, code samples, project ideas etc.. Sure, I wish they were
more discoverable via search - better tagged and yes, even better
rated but the value is from reading what some other teacher has done
and then pulling out aspects that can work for you.

I've rarely used a Nifty Assignment nor something from EngageCS
explicitly but I have gotten value from both sites (CSTA Nifty
assignments are newer and I've been at all the CSTA sessions so
haven't actually used the site). 

Would I ever use a resources "as published?" Perhaps - if
it was really well aligned with how I do things. 

Would I pay? Probably not. I'm not against paying for resources from a
philosophical point of view. Charge a fair price and give a reasonable
assurance that what you're selling has value and provide some value
beyond the free sites. I haven't used Teachers Pay Teachers and
probably won't look at Amazon's thing when it's launched but to me,
they would have to bring value in terms of curation and search. If
they do at a fair price, then they may be worth using.

When I started teaching there was no public internet. None of this
existed. Teachers kept binders or books of lesson plans and if you
were lucky you could borrow from a friend or colleague. New York's DOE
at one point had a few teachers in each subject area submit lesson
plans for "lesson books" which they published for each core
subject. My chairman wrote some of the math ones and those materials
largely got me through my first year. 

Today we have an embarrassment of riches. That comes with the price
that we have to actually read and evaluate all of the materials we're
presented with but I'll take today's resources over what I started with
any day.
