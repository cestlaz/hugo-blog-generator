Yesterday was the start of Passover and like many others we weren't
able to physically gather with friends and family to
celebrate. Since the Talmud, unlike the NYC Dept of Education, doesn't
seem to ban Zoom, like many others, we used Zoom to connect with
family.

Tonight we'll do it again.

In the meantime, I thought I'd share this small bit of research Natan
did a couple of years ago on a traditional part of the seder: [[http://seccorecit.blogspot.com/2018/04/a-historically-informed-echad-mi-yodea.html][A
Historically Informed Echad Mi Yodea]]

Enjoy
