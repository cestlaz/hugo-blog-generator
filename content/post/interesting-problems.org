I organize a monthly professional development session for CS
teachers. It's targeted at teachers who are beyond the beginner stage
and don't want yet another hello world blinky arduino scratch
workshop. Don't get me wrong, given the need for CS teachers we need
plenty of beginner workshops but we also need to take teachers to the
next level. I refer to my workshops as being for teachers of APCS-A,
similar, or beyond. Participants get three hours of CTLE credit and
thanks to our gracious hosts at [[http://digitalocean.com][Digital Ocean]] get to use a great space
and enjoy a free meal.

I particularly enjoyed last weeks workshop for two reasons. One is
that we talked about "interesting problems." This in itself is
interesting because different teachers find different things
interesting. For me, this time around, I was thinking of problems that
could be approached by beginners but had some interesting insight that
allowed them to look at the problem differently and solve it more
efficiently. 

The second reason I liked this session is because I wasn't the only
one presenting!!!

I started the session talking about the Happy Ladybugs problem - a
Hackerrank problem I wrote about [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/happy_ladybug/][here]].

I then passed off to Justin who talked about finding the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull][convex hull]]
bounding a set of points. Justin talked about how you can relate this
abstract geometry problem to real world problems like bounding
neighborhoods as well as how this can be graphically motivated and
then moved to discussing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull_algorithms][algorithms]]. Students can pretty easily come
up with a in inefficient O(n^4) solution and then Justin talked about
incrementally guiding them through alternate solutions ending with
something that runs in O(nlgn). At the end of the day we had a problem
that could be done in a variety of ways with students at different
levels of experience. 

We then moved to Barry's presentation of a [[http://www.baphl.org/20/][puzzle hunt]] problem he
adapted. It involved decoding, translation, number bases and Barry
uses it as a platform to work with stacks.

I finished the evening talking about three problems but we didn't look
at solutions. These were teasers for next time when we also hope to do a
SIGCSE recap.
