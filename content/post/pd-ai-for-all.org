Yesterday we had another Professional Development Workshop for High
School CS Teachers and as usual, I wnat to express my thanks to
[[digitalocean.com][Digital Ocean]] for continuing to provide space, food, and great overall support.

This time though, instead of JonAlf and I having
to run the show we had a guest speaker. We were joined by [[https://twitter.com/SarahEJudd][Sarah Judd]]
of [[http://ai-4-all.org/about/what-is-ai/][AI4ALL]]. 

Sarah gave an overview of what AI4ALL was up to and why but the core
of her presentation was taking us through some of the exercises 
they have been developing at AI4All. Specifically, they're developing
what they call [[http://ai-4-all.org/open-learning/][AI4All Open Learning]] which consists of curricular
materials aimed at high school students. 

As we only had a short time, Sarah took us on a whirlwind tour of what
they're building from the baseline concepts of AI that she feels (and
I agree) that every students should know up to specific AI topics like
neural nets. Obviously you can't cover even a single course in one
evening professional development session but Sarah did a great job
giving both a taste and an overview.

The activities were all engaging and and covered both ethical/societal
issues as well as the technical/CS. I appreciated that the materials weren't
presented as canned experiences but rather tools that a teacher would
use to deliver their own experiences. On the other hand I'm skeptical
of the website's claims of "No AI or computer science experience
necessary." I'm a firm believer that a CS teacher must know both CS
and how to teach it - maybe not at first due to necessity, but
ultimately. Regardless, Sarah has both real teaching experience and CS
knowledge and I put more faith in what she's saying than a PR blurb on a
web site. 


Now you'll notice I haven't said anything specific about Sarah's
presentation or AI4All and that's because Sarah will be giving a
variation of it at SIGCSE in March. If you teach high school and are
going to be at SIGCSE, I highly recommend you check out her session.

If not, perhaps I'll blog more specifics after the event.
