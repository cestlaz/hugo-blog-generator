Time for an update on our NY State Teacher Certification Program. 

We kicked off on Monday. Twenty two students working wiht three
instructors from 9:00 - 3:00 every day. We've been using a combination
of synchronous with Zoom and async using Slack and GitHub
discussions. We're using GitHub as our main platform.

Day 0 was very Zoom heavy but we're trying to balance one big Zoom
session a day combined with other work so as to minimize fatigue. 

1. first day rough

2. flow improved afterwards

3. class comeraderie building - independant zooms

4. still working on it

5. video presentation other instructor on chat works well


6. lots of work building on the fly - students from different backgrounds

7. we're covering CS now and a lot overall

8 exciting first week
