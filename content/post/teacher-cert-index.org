Since we ended up with an eight post postmortem on our CS Teaching
Certificate summer intensive I thought I'd add add an index page. 

Here are links to each post: 


- [[/post/teacher-cert-recap-intro/][Introduction - program overview]]
- [[/post/teacher-cert-methods/][On pedagogy - CS teaching methods]]
- [[/post/teacher-cert-topics/][Topics in Computer Science]]
- [[/post/teacher-cert-methods-choosing/][Deciding on which methods to teach]]
- [[/post/teacher-cert-topics-curriculum/][Commentary on selected CS topics]]
- [[/post/teacher-cert-tools/][Tools for remote instruction]]
- [[/post/teacher-cert-community/][Building a community of CS teachers]]
- [[/post/successes-and-failures.org][The good, the bad, and what's next]]

I also wrote a few posts as the summer intensive was running:

- [[/post/teacher-cert-week-1/][Week 1]]
- [[/post/teacher-cert-week-2/][Week 2]]
- [[/post/merge-over-zoom/][An unplugged activity]]


We start up again in a couple of weeks so look for more updates on the
program then.
