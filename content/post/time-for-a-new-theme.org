While setting up my [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pinebook-update/][Pinebook Pro]] I wanted to make sure I could write
blog posts. [[https://golang.org/][Go]] and [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]] installed and ran no problem but I switched to
Hugo in April 2020 back when it was version .49 or something like
that. Now it's up to .73. It turns out there have been a few
changes. First, I set up my blog with two directories for posts. One
for the posts I wrote originally in Jekyll and one for the ones I
wrote for Hugo. I had to make a few changes to get that to work with
the new version.

I also discovered that my archive page no longer works under the
current version of Hugo. As I poked around a little more, it turns out
that HTML embedding changed so I'm going to have to tweak all my Emacs
posts as well as posts where I embed tweets or other content.

All of this is to say that some or maybe many of my older posts will
be wonky until I can get around to fixing them. 

Rather than figuring out how to fix them under my current blog theme I
figured it was also a good time to explore a new Hugo theme so don't
be surprised if the overall look here changes a few times over the
next few posts.

Hopefully I'll be able to get everything working again sooner rather
than later.
