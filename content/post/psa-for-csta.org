Just a quick public service announcemnt.

Up until now CSTA-NYC has been using Meetup to organize and advertise
events but now they're moving over to using the CSTA site as their
platform. 

If you're a CS teacher you should be a part of CSTA. There's both a
free tier and a plus tier which costs $50 a year.  I've been a plus
member since that level became available. If you're a NYC teacher, you
should join the CSTA NYC chapter. If you're already coming to CSTA-NYC
events, you should still go to the CSTA web site and check to make
sure you're part of the NYC chapter so that you don't miss any
exciting announcements or events.
