As I said in my [[As I mentioned in my ][last post]], I'm moving to a new Hugo theme. I decided
on [[https://github.com/mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis][Anubis]]. It's simple and clean. Unfortunately, in this change over,
many things broke. Specifically, all my embedded html. Using earlier
version of Hugo I could directly embed HTML and it would render. Now I
have to bracket the HTML with special org markup - *#+begin_export html* and *#+end_export html*. 

#+begin_example
#+begin_export html
<h1>html stuff to render goes in here </h1>
#+end_export html
#+end_example

Minimally I had to find all my embedded videos and all my embedded
Tweets. There's probably a lot more. Fortunately with Emacs this is
pretty easy. I used [[https://github.com/dajva/rg.el][rg.el]] which is an Emacs front end to [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]]. If
you don't know ripgrep, it's kind of like a super fast, super enhanced grep on
steroids. 

In Emacs, I was able to do a ripgrep search which created a buffer
containing all the embedded html fragments from all my blog posts
across all the directories. I then used Emacs' [[https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep][wgrep]] feature which
allowed me to edit that combined buffer and save all the results back
to the original files. 

All in all it just took a few minutes. There are still some things I
have to clean up from older posts but at least the site is workable now.

Check out the video for a walkthrough:
