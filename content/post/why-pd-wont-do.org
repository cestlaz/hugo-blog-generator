Overall, I've been down on the Professional Development model that has
been used nationwide to "prepare" our CS teachers. Yes, I'll happily
admit that in order to get to a lot of teachers quickly, starting
teachers off with PD was essential but too many people think it's
doing fine and that's a problem.

Before getting to the specifics of CS PD let's think about PD in
general. There are different types of PDs.

- Teachers sharing practices
- conferences and meetings that teachers choose to attend
- PD run by content providers, that is, people selling something
- PD required by schools and districts

The first two types are usually considered good, the third, sometimes
but not as often. The fourth, fuggedaboudit.

Given that there were and are so few CS teachers that really know CS
and how to teach it, CS training, which started with PD, started with
content providers. As I said at the start, this was essential at first
but had and has many problems.

First off, content providers aren't teaches. Sure, they often hire people
who have taught but usually for a limited period of time. Second,
since they're pushing their product they're usually teaching a pretty
scripted experience and not going beyond either the way they envision
their lessons to progress nor to broader possible content. This was
essential at the start but it's not really preparing teachers. It's
preparing actors for a play. Unfortunately, those 30 or so other
actors in the room (the students) are all doing improv.

Even with those problems content provider provided PD can certainly
have value but there's one more problem and it's HUGE. Professional
Development has no teacher accountability or follow up. When you
attend a PD there are no exams or required projects, no assessment, no
grade for credits - nothing. You attend, you're done.

This is 100% the right way to do it for most fields but not when this is
how you're initially training teachers. I've seen this in the
applicants to my program. I mentioned it in earlier posts but I've
seen far too many applicants who've attended multiple years of CS4All
training in NYC. Training provided by a who's who of providers and
they can barely get past hello world. I've even seen it *in* my
program where a couple of participants have viewed our courses as PDs
and really tried to dial it in. Fortunately, the vast majority get
that we're offering legit grad courses for grad credits and while
you'll work (and hopefully have fun) through the program, you'll
indeed grow as a  CS teacher throughout. 

Combine the fact that PD is never assessed by the fact that NY state
is allowing unprepared teachers to teach CS for the next 10 years and
we've got a problem.

I don't really have an answer - PD in general should remain as it is
in most fields but it should no longer be used as primary teacher
preparation. Even though I strongly believe this, nothing will change
based on the state's stance and the fact that city and state
politicians gain more by rubber stamping CS teachers and saying
they've done it rather than facing the fact that they're going to
exacerbate the difference between the haves - who can make sure
their kids get well prepared teachers, and the have nots who will get
the PD trained kind.

What the city and state should be doing is funding teachers to take
advanced certificate programs like mine and students to take CS
teacher preparation programs, also like mine but like the ones offered
by Siena College and others as well. Do this and reduce the number of
years during which you don't need certification from 10 years to 5 and
you've got a real solution.

I'm not holding my breath.

In any case, there are teachers out there who want to do it right and
there are charitable groups like Gotham Gives and Google who've helped
us at Hunter move around 100 teachers from where they started to
becoming solid CS teachers.

Regardless of what the city and state do, we need more organizations to
get on board funding good programs and more good programs becoming
available to truly prepare teachers. If this happens, I do believe the
teachers will come.
