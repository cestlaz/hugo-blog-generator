Last year I put together a [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-32-cpp/][post and video]] on some basics of Emacs for
C++ development. In the video I didn't quite get completions fully
working. I also used ggtags in that video but find myself using
[[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-33-projectile-jump][dumb-jump]] more frequently.

Here's a quick video showing how to set up [[https://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode][irony-mode]] which uses
libclang for completions. It's pretty slick. Now the only thing I
think I'm missing is header file completions. If you've got a good
setup for that, please share.
