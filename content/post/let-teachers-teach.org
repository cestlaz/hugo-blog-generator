[[https://twitter.com/guzdial][Mark Guzdial]]'s post the other day about [[https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/232557-direct-instruction-is-better-than-discovery-but-what-should-we-be-directly-instructing/fulltext][direct isntruction]] struck a chord with
me. Right up front, Mark said:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The research evidence is growing that students learn better through direct instruction rather than through a discovery-based method, where we expect students to figure things out for themselves.
#+END_QUOTE

Quite a surprise to the teachers who have been beaten over the head
with "everything must be discovery" in recent years. 
At the end of the post, Mark writes:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Iâ€™m a follower of the research Felienne is citing in her blog post, and agree that direct instruction is better than discovery learning for introductory courses
#+END_QUOTE

I found myself very much agreeing with Mark. I'm not surprised. It's
true that Mark and I have traded blog comments with me saying that
a teacher dominant classroom can be very effective and Mark saying
lecturing is bad but after a while I realized that we were saying the
same thing. To me, a teacher dominant high school class means teacher
directed active learning experience and not a droning college lecture. 

In any event, back to direct instruction vs discovery. It seems
like the pendulum is swinging again. A few years ago it was all about
discovery and now direct instruction is ok. There are two problems
here. The first is that in a few years it will be something
else. Before the discovery learning fad we had other fads. When I
started teaching it was cooperative learning. I also went through the
portfolio movement. There were other fads along the way including yet
another "new math." At some point we got back to traditional direct
instruction, then discovery and that brings us back up to today.

The second problem is a big one that's often ignored. Regardless of
what the research says or doesn't say and what teachers know or don't
know the powers that be have time and time again decided upon the one
true way to teach and tried to force it upon teachers.

It doesn't work that way.

The missing piece of the puzzle is the fact that teachers bring
different things to the table and that's a fact that's often
ignored. When teachers are observed, at least in NY, supervisors want
to see what they want to see. After Danielson was implemented in NYC I
was talking to a friend who almost sheepishly told me that she was
getting great evaluations because her teaching style aligned perfectly
with Danielson but she knew that when something else came into vogue
all of a sudden she'd no longer be "highly effective."

When I started, cooperative learning was all the rage but it didn't
work for me. Since it didn't work for me, it didn't work for my
students. This didn't mean that I couldn't cherry pick aspects of
cooperative learning and use them to good effect nor did it mean that
I couldn't run a cooperative learning experience effectively from time
to time  but it meant that I couldn't whole hog teach the way I was
"supposed" to teach. In another case, I knew a teacher who was a very
strong lecturer and I mean this in the traditional one sided lecture
style. He was much weaker when using active learning techniques and in
no way could he give up control to a cooperative learning
experience. That was who he was. He was most effective as a lecturer
for better or worse. With the right group of kids it worked pretty
well. Certainly better than if he was forced to teach in a way that
was contrary to who he was. I've also outright asked some great math teacher
friends of mine about "the research" on how to teach and the responses
I've gotten back were generally either "I don't read the research" or
"it doesn't work for me so I do what I do."

All this isn't to say that research isn't important and that a teacher
shouldn't master a variety of techniques and tools. A good preservice
program will leave a teacher with a cabinet full of tools to draw from
and the expertise to know themselves, their students, and what tools
to put in the toolbelt for an any given class. Teachers should
likewise be trained to maximize their inherent tendencies and talents
and blend in teaching techniques as appropriate. Good professional development
should bring new ideas and new techniques to teachers and should
consider who they can be added in to a teacher's practice rather than
to replace it.

Finally, teachers should be allowed to teach. It's horrible that
there's a movement to more and more scripted lessons and to tell
teachers how to teach. It was bad when I started and it's only gotten
worse.

Fortunately, some supervisors do indeed get it. Back when I was a
young teacher I was talking to a supervisor about this and he told me
that he observed a class he started with one basic question: "is
learning going on?" Everything flowed from there.
