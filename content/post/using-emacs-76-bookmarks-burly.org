I read a post on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/][/r/emacs]] the other day asking if people used Emacs
bookmarks among other things. I thought about it for a bit and
wondered why I didn't use Bookmarks? I did set a few bindings to load
frequently used files and those are like bookmarks but I have to set
those up in my configuration. It turns out that Emacs bookmarks are
pretty easy and effective and work right out of the box. I cover the
basics in the video and you can also check the documentation [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Bookmarks.html][here]]. 

In the video I mention that the bookmark bindings are part of the
bindings used for registers which also include rectangles. If you're
interested in those aspects you can find out all about registers by
viewing [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1YoF4ycLTY][this nice video]] by Prot and I cover rectangle editing [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-28-rectangles/][here]]. 

I also noticed another post on /r/emacs about [[https://github.com/alphapapa/burly.el][burly]] - a package for
managing windows and their associated buffers. It's pretty cool. In
the video I confused myself and thought it might be mapping the
buffers to windows wrong but that was just me confusing myself. 

Burly uses bookmarks to store the configurations which is cool and it
was much easier for me to get my head around it than other
solutions. Burly's install instructions use [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa][quelpa]] and
[[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package][quelpa-use-package]] so now it looks like I'll have to figure those out
as well :-).

The run through is all in the video.

Enjoy.
