In the real world you're usually not building your own projects from
scratch. Much more frequently you're working on a team and you and
other players come and go over time. 

This is in stark contrast to most CS educational experiences where
students typically complete relatively small assignments from
beginning to end. One of my biggest fears way back when as I was about
to graduate college was when I woke up one night in a cold sweath "oh
crap - in a couple of weeks I'm going to have to actually produce good
code. Not just code good enough to get by the grader."

So, as a general rule,  having students build a project and then later
extend it or, even better, having them extend another student's project
can be a very good experience.
