[[https://blog.acthompson.net/2021/09/are-you-assigning-projects-or-recipes.html][This post]] by my friend [[https://twitter.com/alfredtwo][Alfred]] caught my eye yesterday. It's a good
post - some good examples of inserting student creativity even into small
intro level assignments. While I like the post and agree with the
sentiment of open ended, student driven projects, I had to take issue
with the lead quote Alfred used: 

#+begin_quote
“If you assign a project and get back 30 of the same thing, that’s not
a project, that is a recipe.”

-- Chris Lehmann
#+end_quote

Open ended projects and student driven assignments are great and
important but so are ones with similar or identical solutions and
they're also not recipes.

First, there's a certain level of utility in a uniform assignment. If
the assignment is "write a program to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius"
you know that all the students know the conversion as you can provide
it and it also allows them to easily check their work, either through
an autograder or with each other. Yes, I know, some students students
could be tempted to cut corners and copy solutions but usually
attempts to control cheating do more to constrain students doing
things the right way than to prevent the cheaters from cheating.

Also, some student, particularly early on need the structure of a set
assignment and don't do as well with a "do anything assignment."
Saying "just make a converter" can be much more stressful and
difficult than convert from pounds to kilograms.

As to recipes? Not necessarily. Let's take this small assignment:

#+begin_quote
Given two variables *a* and *b*, write a code fragment that will swap
the values represented by *a* and *b*. That is, if at the start, *a*
represented *5* and *b* represented *10*, after your code, *a* would
represent *10* and *b* would represent *5*.
#+end_quote

You could even add a hint:

#+begin_quote
*HINT:* Consider using an extra third variable in your solution.
#+end_quote

This isn't a recipe, it's an assignment. Even with the hint it doesn't
tell the students exactly what to do, just the desired outcome. It's
not a recipe but most or all of the solutions will look remarkably
similar.

By contrast, a swap "recipe" might read:

 1. Create a new variable named *extraBucket*
 2. Assign the value currently in *b* to *extraBucket*
 3. Assign the value currently in *a* to *b*
 4. Assign the value currently in *extraBucket* to *a*

This is a recipe. A student would literally just rewrite the steps
into the solution but even this might have it's place in a class.

A more advanced assignment that leads students through building and
understanding something like a merge or quicksort could be set up
similarly. Not in any way a recipe but rather a valuable exercise
where all the students end up with very similar solutions. This is not
necessarily a bad thing, in fact it was all the rage a few years ago
as it could be set up as a discovery or experiential learning
experience. I also poo pooed that as being the silver bullet but as
with most teaching techniques, it has its place. 

Then there are opportunities to introduce student creativity even when
the assignments are, at their core, all the same. I recall a session
at either SIGCSE or CSTA by [[https://www.bootstrapworld.org/][Bootstrapworld]]. They were describing one
of their classes major projects. It was a game. I forget the details
but at the core, all the student projects were the same. They differed
only in the graphics they used and the story around the game. That's
where Boostrapworld interjected student creativity but the core CS and
math of the student projects were all the same. Did the fact that all
the assignments were essentially the same make this bad or a recipe?
Certainly not. Students go to express themselves uniquely but at the
same time the assignment was constrained and focused on what the
Bootstrapworld designers wanted.

So, there you have it. There's nothing wrong with assignments where
the student results are largely the same. There's also nothing wrong
with student projects that are 100% open ended. It's all about the
teacher having multiple tools and using them as appropriate for their
students.
