Two days ago, a teacher's comment on a frustrating situation [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/outside-evaluators/][made me
mad]]. 

Yesterday, I got to be part of something that made me very happy. 

Last night, Devorah and I ventured out to Coney Island to celebrate
the twentieth wedding anniversary of two former students. It's such a
joy and an honor to be included in these types of life events and even
more so to count the couple and so many other former students and
friends. Devorah joked that she'd been to more weddings of my former
students than of her own friends. Truth be told, I can say the same. I
commented that nowadays I'm more in touch with friends that I've
taught than my own high school and college classmates. Our hosts joked that
it was the right call because my former students are younger and that
helps keep me young :-).

What was also exciting was seeing the couple's oldest daughter for the
first time in a year or so. She'll be starting at Stuy next year. The
grow so fast. Almost makes me sad I'm no longer there. Missed my
chance to teach the offspring of my former students. Still, she's in
great hands with the crew that's still there.

I also had a chance to catch up with some other friends and their
families. Loved seeing young Abe, another "grandstudent" who I haven't
seen since his bris two year ago.

For anyone out there just starting their teaching career - this is the
payoff. The relationships. I know it's hokie but I say that as
teachers in a general sense we should strive to be a force of good in
our student's lives. If we're lucky we see it's appreciated and we get
to see the results.
