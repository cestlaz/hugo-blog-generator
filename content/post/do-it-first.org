Reading Garth Flint's end of year [[https://gflint.wordpress.com/2019/06/07/last-day-of-school-and-done-with-java/][post]] and Alfred Thompson's [[http://blog.acthompson.net/2019/06/how-well-can-you-code-projects-you.html][follow up]]
had me thinking about a couple of things. 

One was spurred when Garth
wrote "They also have to figure out the math before they code." This
made me think about all the details we sometimes [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-11-21-little-details.html/][take for for
granted]]. Things that are hard for our students that we just know. It's
frequently math that we might find trivial but it could also be much
simpler things.

When I write Java code I have a snippet that provides most of my main
boilerplate. For a beginner, just typing in all the details and
getting them right might be a chore. Heck, even typing is something we
take for granted. Beginners who can type have a distinct
advantage. They can focus on the code rather than on the keys. That
boilerplate code might take ten minutes of typing alone and that's not
adding in any typos or understanding errors. 

I don't have anything to add here that I didn't address in earlier
posts and Garth's post has some great points so if you haven't read it
yet, I recommend you take the few minutes to do so.

The other thoughts were spurred from this part of Garth's post:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 did only two of the six assignments myself.  With the others I saw
 the solution so did not code them up.  I should have coded them up
 just so I could answer questions better for the students.
#+END_QUOTE

Alfred expounded on this in his post and there was a good twitter
conversation around it as well.

As a general rule as teachers we should have solved the problems
before we assign them and not just theoretically be able to solve
them. Actually writing up the solutions can also clue us in on some of
the difficulties that our students might face. Particularly if we
really try to look at the assignment using our student's eyes. 

Neal Plotnick tweeted: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The lack of
experience with coding for Ts combined with canned, cloud based
curricula has allowed classrooms to be created with Ts pushing
assignments out and relying on automated grades. I donâ€™t have a CS
degree but I made sure to code my python assignments first.</p>&mdash;

And this is a real concern for me. I get it - we're building a plane
while flying it and that places teachers in situations where they have
to learn on the fly and at times they'll  have to assign problems
before they have  solutions. Long term, however, this is a big problem
and I suspect it's not going to go away. 

On the other side of the coin though are times when it's best not to
have a solution before the class. Sure, if you're teaching a merge
sort or doing a unit on inheritance you probably should have your
ownb written solutions but there are a whole bunch of topics which
lend themselves to doing things on the fly:

 - debugging
 - software engineering practices
 - how to approach "random" problems
 - practical "programming" techniques

can all benefit from an on the fly lesson. 

Coding or teaching on the fly, when used appropriately allows the
teacher to model best practices in real situations. Of course this is
difficult to truly replicate if you teach the same class again later
in the day or if you revisit the class next year but it can be a
valuable tool. When you get a bug - a real bug not a planted one in
your code, you can really model techniques to solve the problem and
you can involve the class in finding that solution.

This can all be pretty scary. You can end up going down the wrong path
and never finish building whatever you're building but overall it can
be a very valuable experience for the students. 

The other consideration is that you can teach a great lesson this way
but it would probably get a low rating on Danielson or whateve
nonsense rubric your district uses for teacher evaluation.

None of this is to say that you don't want to prepare. Most of the
time I'll have solutions worked out or if not, I'll have written
similar solutions countless times before but that said, there's
sometimes value in exploring in the wild or as one of my early
supervisors put it "calling an audible."
