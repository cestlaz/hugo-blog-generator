I spent today at [[https://codelandconf.com/][Codeland]], a one day conference in NYC designed for
developers in the early stages of their careers. Just as at CSTA, I
was there with the GitHub contingent.

Codeland had talks and a keynote in a common auditorium, smaller
breakout workshops and a couple of small vendor areas.

I spent most of the morning upstairs in the GitHub lounge so I onl
caught part of one morning talk. Up in the lounge we, along with the
other vendors - IBM, Flatiron health, and Command Line Hero were
available to talk shop and hang out with conference goers. To be
honest, not too many people came by. I attribute that to the fact that
we were up on the ninth floor and the elevators didn't work very
well. We were in a nice space with plenty of areas for conference
goers to relax, schmooze, get a snack and even play games but it was
too much of an effort to get to us.

I also decided not to attend any of the workshops and stayed up in the
lounge. The workshops were targeted at new devs early in their career
so while some looked interesting to me, I didn't want to take up a
seat from anyone who really could benefit from them,

After lunch, I relocated to the downstairs vendor area. That was much
better. Since it was right near both the snacks and the main
auditorium there was much more foot traffic. I also got to hear and
see all the afternoon talks since audio and video were available right
near where I was set up. They were pretty cool. 

For me, the best part of the conference was the ability to talk with
the conference attendees. On the one hand, I was there to talk GitHub
but I also had the chance to talk general tech with them. I got to
talk to people at all stages on their coding journeys. There were
undergraduate students studying CS, second career people either in
code schools or self learning, Former CS students who's lives had gone
in other directions but now they're looking to get back into tech and
more. I got to hear about the excitement of their adventures and tried
to give advice and encouragement to those having a hard time breaking
in to tech. Having shepherded so many people from neophytes to
professionals I'd like to think I could provide some guidance to some
of the people chatted with.

I don't know if there are any other conferences like Codeland but if
there aren't there should be. It can be hard to break into tech and
Codeland created both a safe environment for tech newbies and also
provided really valuable content. I wasn't familiar with [[https://www.codenewbie.org/][CodeNewbie]],
the organization behind Codeland before but now I'll have to see if I
can have a sit down with them to talk shop and tech ed.
