I spent yesterday evening at the Cooper Union in their [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Union#The_Foundation_Building's_Great_Hall][Great
Hall]], a place famous for Abraham Lincoln's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Union_speech#External_links][speech]] that some say
propelled him to the presidency.

I was there in the audience watching as the Sloan Foundation and the
Fund for the City of New York awarded seven public school teachers
with an ward for "Excellence in the Teaching of Science and
Mathematics."

I was their to see my friend Dave Deusch, a long time public school
physics teacher receive the honor. Here's a brief clip about Dave:
