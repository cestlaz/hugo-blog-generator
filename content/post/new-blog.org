Many of us know [[https://twitter.com/cscheerleader][Ria Galanos]]. Ria - a longtime friend and longtime CS
teacher who has been very active in the APCS community has started a
new chapter as a software engineer at [[https://www.yext.com/][Yext]]. Ria's also started
blogging about it.

I don't know the direction the blog will take but I'm sure it will be
influenced by Ria's years as an educator. I'm also sure it will be
worth reading.

This morning, Ria added an RSS feed to the blog so you won't miss a
post. You can us a reader service like [[https://www.feedly.com][Feedly]] or if you're an Emacs
wonk like me, [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-31-elfeed-3/][elfeed]].

You can find Ria's blog at [[https://cscheerleader.com/][https://cscheerleader.com/]].

Enjoy.
