      <title>It&#39;s not one issue, it&#39;s the President and his enablers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Like many of my fellow bloggers and tweeters, I generally keep this
site clear of political issues with the exception of those that are
directly related to education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, like many of my fellow bloggers and tweeters, this week has
provided a reason to break with that tradition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many people, including some friends, all more eloquent than I have
already posted, tweeted, and Facebooked  about the behavior of our
President and government.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Long time blogger &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/davewiner&#34;&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt; put together &lt;a href=&#34;http://trumpstatus.org/&#34;&gt;trumpstatus.org&lt;/a&gt; where he&amp;#39;s
collecting many of the issues that we&amp;#39;re all so alarmed with.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would add cabinet appointments to his list with my particular
personal concern over DeVos and the department of education. I&amp;#39;ve been
meaning to blog about that for a while - perhaps this week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My concern for today is something else. Every day, I see a new Trump
induced crisis and every day I see a different subset of my circles
respond. It&amp;#39;s not quite as bad as:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Socialist.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Jew.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
People are indeed speaking out, but I am concerned that people
are going to rise up for their personal issue and when placated go
back to business as usual - this is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the time for business as
usual.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With the ACA repeal, I saw concerns from my working class friends and
friends that work with lower earning populations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Going into the DeVos hearing, mostly educators - real educators not
astroturf reformers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With Friday&amp;#39;s order, the whole tech community came out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s part of a thread by tech activist &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/anildash&#34;&gt;Anil Dash&lt;/a&gt; calling out,
calling on, and crediting assorted tech players.
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;When net neutrality was the issue, Google, Twitter, Wikipedia, Reddit, Tumblr, etc. had a blackout, and it worked. This is far more grave.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Anil Dash (@anildash) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/anildash/status/825414889908928517&#34;&gt;January 28, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;A powerful, straightforward statement from the CEO of Box — another publicly-traded company. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/wz5mQmTh6P&#34;&gt;https://t.co/wz5mQmTh6P&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Anil Dash (@anildash) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/anildash/status/825470308463280130&#34;&gt;January 28, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We have to remember that all these order, policies, appointments, and
plans are coming from the same place - Donald Trump and those
politicians that are enabling him.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If he backs off on immigration, education issues remain, if he backs
off there, we still have ACA, if that eases up, what about Women&amp;#39;s
rights and on and on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This means we all have to get involved and stay involved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What have I been doing?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I finally joined the ACLU and set up a monthly donation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I subscribed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://dailyaction.org&#34;&gt;Daily Action&lt;/a&gt; so that I get a reminder each day of
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
someone I can call to make a difference.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m starting to accumulate my representatives phone numbers as I
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
make those calls and am trying to make at least a call a day to
remind our representatives who they work for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Education and advocacy
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And if you suggestions for me - please post them here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thus ends my not business as usual post. What&amp;#39;s going on in America is
not someone else&amp;#39;s problem - it&amp;#39;s all of our problem and we all have
to be active and vigilant to make it through tough times to come.
&lt;/p&gt;
