My friend Ria tweeted this earlier today:
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;If you are a software developer/engineer, please reply with a trait (or traits) that you look for in hiring new engineers (new grads). This can be something you glean from a resume, technical interview, behavorial interview, or all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ria Galanos (@cscheerleader) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cscheerleader/status/1185937705689112577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;October 20, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not hiring for a tech company but I thought I&amp;#39;d share some
thoughts anyway.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A bunch of years ago, I was at a big meeting at the NYCDOE. It was
related to the creation of AFSE. The meeting was attended by a bunch
of NY Tech company heavyweights, DOE people, and me. At this point in
the project, the DOE was pushing the school as one that would produce
&amp;#34;Google ready&amp;#34; software engineers from high school. They were also
insisting on no academic screen so many students would be coming in
multiple years below grade level. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I contended that you could have a great school without a screen but it
was horribly unrealistic to expect to produce &amp;#34;Google ready&amp;#34; engineers
from an incoming class that&amp;#39;s starting far below grade level and it&amp;#39;s
wrong t say you will. Either don&amp;#39;t have a screen and don&amp;#39;t make such
ridiculous claims or if you really intend to deliver, have some manner
of screen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, during the meeting, the DOE wanted to sell the idea that academic
performance wasn&amp;#39;t important to the tech community and this is where
this post meets Ria&amp;#39;s tweet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the DOE reps asked the company &amp;#34;What do you look for in a
potential hire? Things like creativity, right?&amp;#34; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The tech company took the bait. They responded as the DOE planned:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
creativity
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
teamwork
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
hard working
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
reliable
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and so on. A long list of soft skills and truth be told, I agreed that
these things were and are important.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The DOE people thought that there point was made but I had other
plans. I asked a follow up question:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#34;Where do you look for these kids?&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At which point the tech people responded:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stanford
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
MIT
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
CMU
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These companies recruited exclusively at institutions that already did
extreme academic prescreening. The soft skills are important but they
take on even more importance when you&amp;#39;ve already narrowed your search
down to &amp;#34;kids who made it in and through MIT.&amp;#34;  None of the
applicants they considered topped out barely passing 10th grade math.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some of the tech people at the meeting got the point. Some didn&amp;#39;t.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re only going to recruit from the &amp;#34;usual suspects&amp;#34; you&amp;#39;re never
going to expand the pool, never going to achieve a diverse talent
pool, and never really provide opportunities to a huge number of
terrific young people who don&amp;#39;t have the ivy league pedigree.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I had a related conversation with a friend of mine recently where I tried to
further drive home the point. He was talking about how important it
was for a young student who wanted to break into tech to have side
projects - how that an extensive portfolio would always catch his
eye. I told him that this eliminates many terrific low income
students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s easy to ask a well to do kid to spend free time on either a
portfolio, activity or project (and I&amp;#39;ll note that a non-tech project
or activity can be as or more impressive and important than a tech
one) but a low income kid probably has to work and their job is likely
not going to further their tech careers. Require the side project,
eliminate the poor kid.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of this is to say that it&amp;#39;s really hard to say that even when a
hiring agent looks for something, there&amp;#39;s a lot more going on behind
the scenes. It&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;ve become very aware of at Hunter and
something I&amp;#39;ve been trying to push the NY Tech community to
understand.
&lt;/p&gt;
