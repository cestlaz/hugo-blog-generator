        Parts 2 and 3     [[/post/who-played-spiderman-2/][Part 2]    Part 3    I wasn&#39;t going to teach this lesson today. I was planning on starting a multi day project starting with an exercise in specification writing and design.  Beforehand though, we had to talk about classes. One of my students asked if probability and/or statistics were really important for CS. I started to cite a few examples and then decided to segue into this.

        We&#39;ve all been there:   Student: Teacher, I need help Teacher (comes over) Student (shows screen listing three bazillion errors)   The student has just written pages of code and finally decided to try to run it only to end up with pages of errors.  Error messages can at times be hard to read for beginners but to see and truth be told, they frequently don&#39;t even read them but over the years I&#39;ve developed a practice that I&#39;ve found helpful as a software developer and if students adopt the same practice it can save them a lot of time and effort.

        Do we really need CS focused high schools?  That&#39;s the question Alfred Thompson asked partly in reaction to my post talking about Bill Gates&#39; visit to AFSE, a NYC public school with a CS focus.  On both posts, Michael Preston shared some important and good points about AFSE as a starting point and gateway that helped lead to CS4All in NYC and also specifically about AFSE.  In response to Alfred&#39;s question I thought it was time I shared a bit about what I was pushing for AFSE back when I was involved.

        Yesterday, Alfred Thompson asked &#34;Why is it important for CS students to understand binary?&#34; on Twitter which led to a number of interesting responses. Alfred summarized and wrote his own thoughts on his blog.  I wanted to add a comment but I already wrote a post for yesterday so put it off until today.  First let me say that you can have a very successful career in tech and not really know binary or number bases other than 10.

I played with it a little really mostly used Emacs clones for real work when I was stuck on MS-DOS systems. Usually either JOVE or Epsilon  In the comments Jon reminded me about the MKS Toolkit which brought most everyday Unix tools to DOS along with a shell and a version of Vi.

        Yesterday I was back on campus for an early orientation session for Hunter&#39;s incoming Daedalus CS honors students. It was the first time all of us got to meet face to face. The students I met with will be my third cohort. I got to thinking how far we&#39;ve come in under three years.  Hunter&#39;s had a strong but little known undergraduate CS program for as long as I&#39;ve known.

        About a week ago New York State&#39;s new regulation creating a K12 CS teacher certification went live. Just the other day I was honored to be interviewed by Matt Flamm of Crain&#39;s New York in a follow up piece about it.  Having K12 CS teacher certification is big and having quality programs that lead to certification is HUGE. In my view, it&#39;s a game changer.  Let&#39;s Focus on high school, my wheelhouse.

The rain and the snow made for very little spring and between working on the Hunter / CUNY2X Internship program and reviewing applications for my Hunter Daedalus CS Honors program there has been very little break.  Today was no exception - I spent much of the day working but I did take a few hours to head over to Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island.

I do my best to keep up with the latest and greatest in the CS world both on the academic side as well as the professional one. That&#39;s not really possible, but I do my best. When I have a small project to work on I&#39;ll some times use it as an excuse to play with some recent technology.
