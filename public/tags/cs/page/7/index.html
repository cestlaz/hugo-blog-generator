    </header>

    <div class="content post-summary">
        Last year I wrote about repl.it, an online IDE that supports multiple languages. At the time it had some rudimentary classroom support and since I started using it, repl.it has become better and better. I used it last year with my class because I had to start the year in a lab where I couldn&#39;t easily install my own software. I&#39;ll continue to use repl.it - mostly for it&#39;s ability to schedule publish and manage assignments but when possible, I like having my students work locally.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        People sometimes accuse me of being an elitist CS snob that I feel that CS teachers have to have advanced CS degrees.  It&#39;s not that at all. Rather, I feel that CS teachers are smart and capable. Circumstances frequently result in a teacher in front of a CS class with limited content and pedagogical content knowledge. It&#39;s not ideal but it&#39;s reality. Of course I feel that we should do everything to support and encourage these teachers but we should also insist that after a reasonable period of time, they know their stuff.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        With the school year starting I was originally planning on writing about my class rules.  Instead I think I&#39;ll riff on Alfred Thompson&#39;s post today titled Curriculum is Hard. I&#39;m guessing I found curriculum design and development daunting decades ago but at this point in my career it&#39;s something I enjoy. In any event, Alfred got me to thinking - when is a curriculum your own?  If you grab a curriculum complete with lesson plans, assignments; the whole kit and caboodle and you use it verbatim it&#39;s clearly not your curriculum.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        At this past year&#39;s CSTA conference, a few of us huddled in a corner voiced a very common lament - &#34;it would be great if more CS teachers blogged.&#34; It really would be. We&#39;re still a relatively small community and while there&#39;s some good conversation going on on mailing lists and on Facebook, those aren&#39;t easily discoverable or accessible and in the case of Facebook, there&#39;s a question of ownership and permanence.

        I got an email from a friend the other day. Among other things, he mentioned that he would be teaching APCS-A for the first time this year. He&#39;s a little trepidatious. He knows his stuff but he hasn&#39;t really done much using Java.  I was going to respond in an email but thought I might share here instead.   TL;DR - for all you APCS teachers who are new or new to Java - learn your core CS, lean on your resources and support and it&#39;s OK to tell your kids &#34;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ll get back to you.

        Yesterday Mark Guzdial blogged about a NY Times piece discussing Silicon Valleys influence on education through Code.org.  Mark questioned the validity of the piece. If you don&#39;t read Mark&#39;s blog and you&#39;re in CS Ed you probably should.  I tried to leave a comment on Mark&#39;s blog - not about the NY Times article but rather my thoughts on why I think it&#39;s important that we remain wary and vigilant to industry and outsiders influence and impact on CS education and on education in general.

        For anyone involved in K12 CS education, the past few years have been a wild ride. When I first tried to make inroads in the DOE decades ago I couldn&#39;t get through the door. Now, CS Education is everyone&#39;s darling. It&#39;s really amazing. It&#39;s been a combination of grass roots efforts by teachers, non profit education efforts such as TEALS, advocacy of groups like Code.org and amazing individuals like Fred Wilson who has probably done more to move the needle of CS Ed in NY than any other 10 people combined.
