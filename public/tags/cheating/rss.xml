      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I haven&amp;#39;t been teaching this past semester. That&amp;#39;s why I haven&amp;#39;t been
writing much about lessons. I miss working with students but that will
resume in the fall and this semester has allowed me to get a jump on
new projects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s also allowed me to look at some student issues from a bit of a
distance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One issue that keeps coming up is cheating.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some of it, classroom cheating. my friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cscheerleader&#34;&gt;Ria&lt;/a&gt; recently asked a
question on Facebook about it. A nice thread ensued but unfortunately,
it&amp;#39;s locked in the Facebook silo. I&amp;#39;ve got a lot to say on that and
hope to explore it soon but today let&amp;#39;s focus on project
cheating - something that could just as easily apply to homeworks and
student essays and research papers as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One part of the question is on students using code they find out in
the wild. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alfredtwo&#34;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; wrote a bit about it on his blog &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2016/05/copying-codesteal-from-best.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; where he points
out some pluses, some minuses, and raises some good thought points.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I want to keep it in the class - code sharing amongst students,
project and source code submission, and group projects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teachers have all sorts of options these days including:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using a CMS like Blackboard or Moodle
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dropbox based solutions
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Emailing projects
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using development tools and sites such as git with GitHub, BitBucket
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
or other repository hosting services
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve always been a fan of having the kids learn real software
engineering skills along with the CS so Git, GitHub and public repos
have been my weapon of choice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Interesting enough, I&amp;#39;ve gotten an earful both from fellow teachers
and professors and online for my stance on public repos.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I keep hearing &amp;#34;the kids will copy from each other&amp;#34; or something like
that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As Alfred said in his post: &amp;#34;Students have been copying from
classmates for years.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Students who want to copy assignments have done so long before we&amp;#39;ve
been teaching CS and they&amp;#39;ll be doing it for years to come.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using a hidden submission system doesn&amp;#39;t help and could hurt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Far better to create an open environment. You get an opportunity to
talk about code sharing, attribution, learning from each other,
supporting each other, and where to draw the line.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On top of that, the students learn a real tool set and have a chance
to learn real development methodologies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s a win all around.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Will open repos stop cheating and irresponsible copying? Certainly
not. It could, however, raise awareness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So what do I do on the cheating front?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Besides trying to create a culture where cheating is discouraged,
cooperation is encouraged but where students know the line, I will try
to keep them honest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Frequently, the day a big project is due, I&amp;#39;ll give a quiz on the
project. Students will have to describe parts of the project and what
they did. Either a student will have had to contributed or at least
will have had to have studied the rest of the teams code to pass the
quiz.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
GitHub also gives tools that help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s the GitHub graph for a project:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/github-graph.png&#34; alt=&#34;/img/github-graph.png&#34; title=&#34;/img/github-graph.png&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can see who did what and when. The teacher can drill down further
to examine the diffs â€“ what code did each student write, when, and
from where. If two students submit very similar code, the commit
timestamps will even tell you who was first.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The tooling for teachers could be better but the infrastructure is
there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Technology isn&amp;#39;t going to prevent cheating and more often than not, it
seems that measures taken don&amp;#39;t stop the bad guys but inconvenience
those trying to do it right.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Much better to build a class culture where the kids want to do it the
right way.
&lt;/p&gt;
