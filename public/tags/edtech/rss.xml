      <title>Preparing to teach Online</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been seeing some tweets over the past couple of days about the
wonders of online teaching. How it&amp;#39;s at least as good or better than
in person or how we should have been doing it all along. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rubbish.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you say that online is better than in person that says more about
the (low) quality of your teaching than it does about the quality of
online tech teaching resources.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I mean, it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that anything you can do online you can do
in person since you can still avail yourselves of the same tech tools
while you can also do the in person live stuff. Online you&amp;#39;ve only got
online.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking at it another way, is an online show, concert, or sporting
event (weather notwithstanding) ever better than the live thing?
There&amp;#39;s something about in person even when you take away the
connection between teacher and students and students and students that
makes it special.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While online isn&amp;#39;t better there are times where it&amp;#39;s necessary or can
be used to complement or enhance in person. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hunter hasn&amp;#39;t made any announcements about any closings due to COVID19
but it would be foolish not to prepare. I also want to figure out if
some of my CS Teacher Certification program can be offered remotely as
not all interested teachers can get to campus. For these reasons and a
few more, I think I&amp;#39;d like to try to do at least a couple of my
classes remotely over the next few of weeks (sooner if it&amp;#39;s forced
upon us).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Technology shouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem - all my students get a laptop as
part of the Daedalus program. The only questions are will they have
sufficient bandwidth if they&amp;#39;re joining from home and if they have a
suitable location from where they can connect in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As part of Hunter&amp;#39;s School of Education I can use Zoom and that has
the video conferencing, chat, screen sharing and whiteboarding. The
only thing I have to workout  is how to use the breakout room features
for group work and to see if that can flow nicely in the class. I&amp;#39;ve
got a couple of lessons that should work pretty well as first time
experiments so overall it should be pretty easy to give it a go.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Will it be as good as live? No. Will it be better than nothing?
Absolutely. Is it worth burning a live class to learn a bit about
online - to see what can be done without extensive training and class
prep and to see what can be leveraged in a pinch? I think so.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If it happens, I&amp;#39;ll report back.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Tech or the Teacher</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/tech-or-teacher/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Every morning one of the first things I do is quickly glance at my
emails and other notifications. I really should wait until I&amp;#39;m more
awake but old habits die hard.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As some of you know over the past couple of years I&amp;#39;ve been making a
series of &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs&#34;&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; and related post on using my editor of choice,
Emacs. I&amp;#39;ve done 48 videos, have over 2500 subscribers on
YouTube and people seem to find some value from the series.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This morning one of my emails was a new comment on one of my videos:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for not describing a single key combination and how that fits
into basic usage of org mode.  I was going to subscribe but if all
your videos are going to be about showing off how fast you are at
typing emacs commands on your annoyingly noisy keyborad, then no
thanks!ï»¿
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My first reaction was &amp;#34;you know, you could have said something like
&amp;#39;if you slow down an actually say the keys it would be much easier to
follow and would be more valuable&amp;#39; and it would be much better received&amp;#34; but
then I started to think about instructional videos in general. I
started to make these videos for my students. I thought they might be
helpful and then found that the Emacs community by and large liked
them. They&amp;#39;re not teaching anything deep or complicated just how I use
a programmable editor. Even so, I was reminded by this comment about
the limitations of videos and ed tech in general.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Videos provide some nice features - you can watch them at any time,
you can pause and replay, and in some cases you can watch at super
speeds. What you can&amp;#39;t do is slow the video down and most importantly
you can&amp;#39;t ask questions or interact with the instructor. You can leave
comments if the video is on a platform like YouTube but that&amp;#39;s pretty
limited.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, if this was a class, we would have been able to
interact and I as the instructor would have had a much better chance
to make sure this &amp;#34;student&amp;#34; was up to speed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, this wasn&amp;#39;t a class. I don&amp;#39;t have the time to teach tools
like Emacs in class and since it is a mechanical skill, it can be
offloaded to a video. The video has the ancillary benefit of living on
and being discoverable and viewable by the public at large. This is a
good thing. Videos are tech and tech scales. Unfortunately, good
education doesn&amp;#39;t.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Videos are tech and tech is the rage. Lots of people are working hard
to get more tech in front of our kids - usually at the expense of
having a great teacher. This is something we don&amp;#39;t need. Technology is
nice but I&amp;#39;d rather have my kids in a small class with a knowledgable
teacher and a piece of chalk than all the tech in the world.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a computer science guy and a computer science teacher I think it&amp;#39;s
good to remind myself that tech is cool but a good teacher is way cooler.
&lt;/p&gt;
