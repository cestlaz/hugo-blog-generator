      <title>Time To Create An Ethics Course</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I think it&amp;#39;s time for me to start developing a CS Ethics class.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An ethics course isn&amp;#39;t a replacement for having teachers that live and
model good behavior and weave ethical issues throughout the curriculum
but still, adding a separate course on top of that has its merits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not in a rush to create this course. I might be done in a month or
it might take a couple of years. When I&amp;#39;m done, I&amp;#39;ll add it as an
option in my CS Teacher education programs but hopefully it will be an
attractive course for undergrad CS majors as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While it&amp;#39;s easy enough to come up with possible topics - privacy,
moral responsibilities, biased algorithms, net neutrality and on and
on I&amp;#39;m looking for this course to have a serious coding component. I
want the students to build things to really understand the
implications of what they&amp;#39;re studying.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One topic I definitely want to cover is &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/10/youre-not-so-anonymous/&#34;&gt;anonimity&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;d love to find
the right combination of data sets and have the class discover that
some hidden information in the sets isn&amp;#39;t nearly as hidden as it seems
to be. When I was at Stuy, I was thinking about
having the kids give me permission to use their class schedules since
even with names removed we could probably identify many kids by
electives and overlapping classes. I have no idea what I&amp;#39;ll be able to
do at Hunter. If I can come up with something good I think this will
form the basis of a pretty amazing part of the class.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another project I&amp;#39;d love to put together is something dealing with a
biased algorithm. Again, I don&amp;#39;t know where this will go, maybe
something where I can seed the class so that different groups
implement some project differently and we can then analyze each groups
biases, hidden or otherwise.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Beyond these two, I&amp;#39;m not sure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How about you? Anyone out there have any good ideas for programming
projects for an ethical CS course? If so, please share. It might be a
while but when I do finish putting this together I&amp;#39;ll be sure to
publish whatever the end result is.
&lt;/p&gt;
