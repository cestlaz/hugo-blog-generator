    <div class="content post-summary">
        div.center {text-align:center;}   The other day, Alfred Thompson put up a piece about coding in multiple languages. Alfred references a post written last May by Rob Underwood.  Both pieces are worth a look.  Rob is trying to illustrate many of the superficial similarities in popular languages.  In the comments on Alfred's blog, both Alfred and I alluded to coding in an appropriate style for the language.

We spend an inordinate amount of time trying to see the problem and then realize that we just forgot something silly.  At this point, it's common for us CS teachers to tell each other "

        The StuyCS Family mailing list was host to an interesting discussion today. One of our younger members asked if the practice of giving technical problems during an interview was going to follow him throughout his career or if it goes away for more senior applicants.  An interesting discussion followed.  It reminded me of a time I was talking to a few senior engineers at a large tech company.

None of these are about good education. It's really demoralizing reading article after article devaluing true master teachers and real education.  So, last night was a real pleasure.  I attended a talk, given by Alan Alda on communicating science. The talk was sponsored by The Academy for Teachers.

Chris is working with one of our more advanced groups of hackers - they'll be creating a web based app that with ultimately be deployed as mobile using PhoneGap.  The question he had was "Angular.js or Backbone.js."  Chris and I have had this conversation before. I was explaining at the time why I preferred to use Backbone.

Fellow CS Teaching veteran Alfred Thompson had his say up on his blog where he talked about Mark Guzdial's comment on autograders leading to less creative assignments.  I very much agree that autograders, due to their rigidness lend themselves to less creative projects, but thought I'd write up a few of my own thoughts on autograders.

        div.center {text-align:center;}    We talked about setting kids up to fail in math. What about CS?  Well, it's a little subtler.  I started thinking about this after a conversation with one of my graduates about Harvard's famous CS50. Since that conversation, I've spoken to a number of my kids that have gone through CS50 and most seem to say the same things: They don't really teach anything  The kids rely on a group member who already knows stuff or will learn all the stuff on their own  If it weren't for my StuyCS background my group would have really struggled.
