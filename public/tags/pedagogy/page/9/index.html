        So, we&rsquo;re into the second year of my Software Development class. It&rsquo;s a little different since last time, I taught many of the kids in AP. This time, they&rsquo;re mostly new to me.
In AP, everything is low level. The students build linked lists, binary search trees, heaps, hash tables, graphs and the like. It&rsquo;s all about building the data structure. The Node, if you would.
We&rsquo;re about to start talking about databases.

        About a month ago, I talked about using real data with our intro classes. After looking at the correlation between school&rsquo;s SAT scores and free and reduced lunch rates, it was time to turn the students loose.
The assignment: Find some interesting data out and do something with it. Make a web page that shows what you did and what you discoverde. We had already looked at the NYC Data Mine as well as a few other sources but students were encouraged to find new data sourcess.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        Earlier in the term, our intro classes spent a little time learning some basic HTML. We don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time on it, just enough so that the students can present their work in a static web site. The end goal, though, was to programatically generate the web sites - there&rsquo;s nothing quite as empowering to a student as when they can present their work to the world.
Finally, it&rsquo;s all coming together.

        When looking for assignments for our classes, in addition to trying to craft assignments that develop and reinforce key ideas, we also strive to come up with ideas that &ldquo;speak&rdquo; to the students and keep their interest. We write small games, use problems within the student&rsquo;s experiences, and in general try to find problems that are appealing.
This is much easier to do when the kids can read data from a file.

        Last week was crazy. Busy, stressful, late night after late night. It ended, though, on a great note.
A young lady in my intro class found me in my office near the end of the day:
 Student: Mr. Z, I wanted to make sure to catch you before vacation!
  Me: What&rsquo;s up?
  Student: I wanted to tell you that today&rsquo;s lesson was AWESOME!!!!!!
 Wow. I&rsquo;ve been teaching 23 years and that&rsquo;s never happened before!

        My last post I was talking about the fact that as teachers, our knowledge and experience is frequently trivialized. The tenor of the times is that anyone can design a course, anyone can teach, and in fact, we don't even need teachers, just videos or computer based systems. If you've ever tutored a friend, you're more than qualified.  That might be a strong statement but everywhere you look you see "

        Sorting from the top and from the bottom I've been meaning to write this post for a couple of weeks, but some times life just gets in the way. I've always thought it important to arm students with as many different tools with which to attack problems as possible. As such, the courses I teach use a number of different languages, each highlighting a different paradigm and thought process. The hope is that by the end of the sequence, they can look at problems from many different angles.

In thinking about how I frequently programs, once I have a plan, I work on one part of the project, and then ask myself "what's next?" That is, what is the next step towards completion.
It reminded me about a guest speaker we had a about a year and a half ago at one of our "professional development" days. For the past two years, our school has had "

        Closed out last week teaching the Towers of Hanoi. It's a wonderful topic. Not because it's so interesting in and of itself, but as a platform from which you can explore any number of interesting topics.
Many books appropriate for the AP (AB) curriculum mention the towers, but to my knowledge most only scratch the surface. I randomly grabbed two books that I consider good from the shelf before writing this.
