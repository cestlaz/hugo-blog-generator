Both the shipmates and the stewards will be showing off their work and I can't wait. I've intentionally stayed away from the shipmates because I want to be surprised but I've seen what the stewards have been doing and I can't tell you how proud I am of their work.

        div.center {text-align:center;}    We're almost at the end of CSTUY SHIP's first journey. The Shipmates and stewards will be showing off their work in another day or so and I'm excited to see their finished projects.  But what toolset are they using.     With knew we would be working with two rooms of relative beginners. We needed something that allowed us to develop the shipmates CS skills while also having a low cost of entry.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   Cynthia Koo talking about UX    Much like the Love Boat had every week, at CSTUY SHIP, we too have our guest stars.  On the one hand, it's important to have a focused program that leaves the shipmates empowered to continue their CS studies on their own. That means the shipmates have to explore something with sufficient depth so that the learning sticks.

        Our hackers have been coming down to SumAll every Saturday for a while now. It&rsquo;s a great space and we&rsquo;ve been given run of the office. That said, the hackers really had no idea what SumAll is all about.
Today, we had our first guest speaker. Davin Chew, founder and CTO of SumAll. Davin&rsquo;s also a member of the StuyCS family, he was my student back in the nineties. When Davin heard we needed space for our Saturday program, he and the SumAll team graciously offered to host.

Saturday, hacking sessions were set to resume. Being in Manhattan, getting around was pretty easy but we&rsquo;ve got hackers from all over the city from Staten Island to the Bronx.

        Week 5.
Last week, I lamented over the difficulties with only meeting once a week. We went over a log of new material last week and I was happy when today rolled around and the hackers would be able to start putting things together.
When writing a web app, you&rsquo;ve got to know about all sorts of things - for us it&rsquo;s HTML, CSS, Python, and the microframework, flask. That&rsquo;s quite a bit, particularly when working with a group with a wide range of experience coming in.
