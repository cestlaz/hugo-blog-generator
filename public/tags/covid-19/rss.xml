      <title>Future consequences of today&#39;s grading policies</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/grading-consequences/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
How are we going to deal with grades? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This has garnered a lot of attention since COVID-19 struck.  Over on
the AP side people wonder if colleges will give credit? Do the tests
mean anything? What about the material they won&amp;#39;t be testing? We also
have had standardized tests canceled and a variety of grading
policies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m going to stay away from AP this time around - you all know my
feelings about the college board. I will leave you with a couple of
good posts though that share many of my views (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/views/2020/05/26/ap-courses-do-not-deserve-college-credit-opinion&#34;&gt;AP Courses don&amp;#39;t
deserve college credit&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&#34;https://jd2718.org/2020/05/18/retiring-advanced-placement/&#34;&gt; Retiring Advanced Placement&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The bottom line is that student and teachers lives have been severely
disrupted  since early March. In NYC public schools that means three
to four months which is a considerable chunk of the semester. In
college the percent is slightly less but it&amp;#39;s still a good chunk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some students have done fine but many have had difficulty and I&amp;#39;d
venture a guess to say most won&amp;#39;t end the semester in the same place
they would have under normal circumstances.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about this as a result of Hunter&amp;#39;s policy and I
don&amp;#39;t really have a good answer. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hunter decided that instructors would award grades as they normally
would. Each instructor would follow their own counsel on how to
grade. Should they be super lenient due to circumstances? Extra hard
because of perceived cheating (don&amp;#39;t get me started on this), same old
same old or some other method. Once grades were awarded, students have
the ability to change any or all classes to pass/fail. Normally if a
student takes a class pass/fail it can&amp;#39;t be used as a prerequisite or
to fill a major requirement but for this past semester, it can. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Overall I like this policy - it gives the students most of the control
and they don&amp;#39;t have to decide on anything until after the fact. The
bad part comes in though with the any passed class counting as a
prerequisite of for the major. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s say I have a student in CS1 who was doing well but really
struggled at the end after we went remote. Maybe that student was
doing A or B work up to the switch but basically got nothing out of
the rest of the semester. I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to fail the student. Under
normal circumstances, we make the false assumption that the grade is
entirely the result of the student and factors surrounding the
student&amp;#39;s environment. Even if that assumption were 100% true the Covid
Curve Ball was not the students fault and the negative impact to their
studies could not only be due to their circumstances but also due to
actions of the college or the way the instructor reacted to the
circumstances. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With Hunter&amp;#39;s policy, I could award any passing grade - even a D and
the student could convert it to a Pass and move on to CS2. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The danger here is that the student might not be prepared for CS2. We
cover memory pointers, memory management, and classes at the end of
CS1. So much of CS2 is built on pointer based programs that a student
who missed out on that in CS1 is going to struggle mightily. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You might say that the kid could have retaken CS1 but there&amp;#39;s a wrench
in the works. If the kid failed CS1 they could retake it. With a Pass
they can&amp;#39;t. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A student could, with the permission of some instructor audit the
missed parts of CS1 or self study but we know that won&amp;#39;t always
happen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The alternative is to award a failing grade to the student which would
then hurt their GPA and force them to retake the entire course.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You might say that the school could just adjust the curricula for next
year but it&amp;#39;s not that simple. In high school most students progress
in lockstep. In college there&amp;#39;s more variation. Next semester&amp;#39;s CS2
will have students who completed CS1 this past semester under the
cloud of COVID-19, students who completed it on the Fall, some from
summer and some from other places. This is where curricular
consistency is somewhat more important.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I do like Hunter&amp;#39;s policy and I do think it&amp;#39;s on the side of the
student but I&amp;#39;m not happy about this loophole.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This probably won&amp;#39;t affect a huge number of students but some will
fall through the cracks. As I said, I don&amp;#39;t have a good answer but it
is something I&amp;#39;m really concerned about.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teaching Online -  Day 01</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teaching-online-day-01/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Mar 2020 11:48:20 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teaching-online-day-01/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I taught my first two online classes this morning. The first one from
8:10 - 9:25 and the second from 9:45 - 11:00.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Toolset:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Zoom meetings
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Emacs (yes, not just an editor)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First up Zoom.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think I want a video camera on policy. All my students should have
laptops with working cameras. Some students might have issues with
showing even a small bit of what&amp;#39;s behind them so I don&amp;#39;t want to make
it required but I really wish they&amp;#39;d also have cameras on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To get some level of visual feedback and interaction. Having made over
60 &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs/&#34;&gt;Emacs videos&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#39;m used to talking to my own screen but when you know
you&amp;#39;ve got a live audience that you&amp;#39;re working with it&amp;#39;s different. If
I&amp;#39;m just talking to a bunch of black boxes with names in them I don&amp;#39;t
feel any connection with my students. If I see them I feel we&amp;#39;re
together.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was also an issue when I went to screen sharing. Now Zoom handled
the screen sharing terrifically.  You can share either one specific
window, a virtual whiteboard or your whole screen. When sharing,
though, instead of seeing a bunch of small windows with lots of people
in them you only see around four which isn&amp;#39;t representative of the
whole class. Better than nothing but I wish I had a long line of boxes
that could easily scroll.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another thing with the screen sharing - it worked great but this is
also where two monitors would be helpful. I went from two 30&amp;#34; monitors
to one 43&amp;#34; 4K monitor. I love my current setup but it seems with Zoom
you share all or nothing. I&amp;#39;m guessing with two monitors I could share
one monitor and use the other for notes and staging. With one big
monitor I can&amp;#39;t do this - I have to share the whole screen. Not a huge
problem but makes things a bit less smooth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is where Emacs comes in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For a decent part of the lesson, I&amp;#39;d share my Emacs window. Since I
can split the window and quickly jump between buffers (screens) I
could bring up a variety of things. I had a shell in one buffer so I
could run terminal stuff, a source code buffer, one in org-mode for
outlines and table work and one in artist mode for rudimentary
diagramming. I think it worked reasonably well for a first shot.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, we also used the Zoom chat. Some students would mic on and
off to take part but more used the chat. It was a bit weird at
first. I&amp;#39;d talk, they&amp;#39;d write but both classes got into a pretty good
tempo after a while. I think it could work. Interesting though was
that my first class had a bunch of cross class chat in the general
(public) chat during the lesson. Silly remarks back and forth. Truth
be told, I liked it. My second class didn&amp;#39;t although there might have
been some of that in private chats.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I asked the classes to share what their other instructors are doing
and using and I&amp;#39;m really interested in hearing. I&amp;#39;m also hoping that
they&amp;#39;re open with me in terms of what&amp;#39;s working and what isn&amp;#39;t. I want
this to be the best experience for them that we can create and I&amp;#39;m not
so proud as to think I know how to do it and that they don&amp;#39;t know
better.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now to plan for the next one.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teaching online - a test run</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/online-testrun/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 16:49:36 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/online-testrun/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hunter&amp;#39;s classes are still on hiatus while we figure out how we&amp;#39;re
going to deliver instruction remotely. I have it easier than
most. First, my students all get laptops as being part of the Daedalus
program. This doesn&amp;#39;t mean they have great internet access or access
at all but it does mean they have a device that can run everything we
need them to run. I don&amp;#39;t yet know if they all have adequate internet
access but I&amp;#39;m hoping it&amp;#39;s either not an issue or one that we can
easily figure out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next, software. Again, I&amp;#39;m lucky. Zoom seems to be the best of breed
for synchronous stuff and as faculty in the school of education, I
have an account. The rest of the CS faculty don&amp;#39;t. The rest of Hunter
has to use some combination of Blackboard based tools and freely
available stuff. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today, we tested everything out. I had about 10 students volunteer. We
did a Zoom meeting and tried all the feature: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
public and private chat
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
screen sharing
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
whiteboards
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
breakout rooms
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The breakout rooms were the big thing I wanted to check out. They&amp;#39;re a
little clunky but overall pretty nice. It&amp;#39;s a bit kludgey when someone
joins the conference after breakout rooms are formed but overall it
worked well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For async stuff we&amp;#39;ll mostly stick with the same tools - email, GitHub
and GitHub classroom but I think we&amp;#39;ll also give Slack another go. My
problem with Slack is that it didn&amp;#39;t seem to work well within the
students day. It may work for a professional in front of their screen
most of the day but students are in and out of class and other
obligations. They&amp;#39;ll miss the real time flow and then have to navigate
through a muddy thread stream to catch up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now with everyone working from home Slack might be a better fit. We&amp;#39;ll
see.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thursday I go live. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think the lesson I&amp;#39;m planning for my CS1 translates pretty easily to
online but might have to work my CS2 plans. In any event we&amp;#39;ll see how
it goes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m sure the rest of the semester will be challenging for all of us
but I also know it&amp;#39;s okay if we fumble through and make mistakes. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/focus-to-feel-normal/&#34;&gt;It&amp;#39;s
not all about the content&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Would love to hear from my fellow teachers how it&amp;#39;s working with
them. Alfred Thompson has already been blogging about &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2020/03/teaching-from-homeday-1.html&#34;&gt;his experiences&lt;/a&gt;
with going remote so we&amp;#39;re getting play by play from a rural private
(Catholic) high school. I&amp;#39;ll add the NYC public college
experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you want to share how it&amp;#39;s going for you but don&amp;#39;t blog, send it as
a long comment or do a guest post.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;ll all be more isolated physically over the next few weeks so let&amp;#39;s
share more in the digital world.
&lt;/p&gt;

Austin Cory Bart tweeted this a little while ago.
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I don&amp;#39;t
always consider how much power I have as a faculty. Right now, I&amp;#39;d
really like to expend that power to make my students understand that I
don&amp;#39;t want them focused on my course during a global pandemic. Not
right now. Later, but not right now.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Austin Cory Bart
(@AustinCorgiBart) &lt;a
href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AustinCorgiBart/status/1238565390575456262?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;March
13, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async
src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34;
charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While Cory&amp;#39;s right about this it&amp;#39;s also good to remember that as
we&amp;#39;re all going remote, focusing on our courses can be important for
our students not merely due to content but in this time of uncertainty
to have something to focus on to remind us of community and remind us
of normal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While all our students are now home or being sent home they&amp;#39;re going
to be in semi isolation. Most will be with families but many will be
isolated from friends and classmates and without our courses, in a
limbo state left to obsess and stress over the current state of
affairs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Focusing on our class  - through synchronous onlinen classes and
mailing lists, working on assignments, and otherwise engaging in this
approximation of our students regular weeks we&amp;#39;re providing a valuable
distraction in addition to whatever actual course material we can
cover.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve seen it before. After 9/11 and to a lesser extent after
Sandy. After 9/11 we were closed for about a a week. Based on the
email list I was able to put together and the back and forths I had
between parents and students stress was high, information and outlets
low. We managed to set up one event that got a bunch of students
together and it was really needed. We restarted classes at Brooklyn
Tech and stayed for close to a month. Classes were half length
starting in the afteroon. I was teaching CS without any real computer
access, some classes shared rooms and in general it&amp;#39;s debatable how
much learning happened. What it did do though, is it gave the kids
something to focus on other than the 9/11 attacks and their
aftermath. It wasn&amp;#39;t normal but it was &amp;#34;normaler.&amp;#34; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the years that followed, I&amp;#39;d hear from both parents and students -
a number of whom I never taught about how important it was giving them
something to do other than obsess about the events of the day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Same thing after Sandy. Some students weren&amp;#39;t all that affected but
others suffered tremendous losses. We set up virtual classes for a
couple of days while school wasn&amp;#39;t in session. Again, it gave them
something to focus on that wasn&amp;#39;t the superstorm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Same thing this time around. We all should be aware and alert to
everything happening but we also need community and things to focus
on. Our classes can be one of those things.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Preparing to teach Online</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/preparing-for-online/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 23:54:18 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/preparing-for-online/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been seeing some tweets over the past couple of days about the
wonders of online teaching. How it&amp;#39;s at least as good or better than
in person or how we should have been doing it all along. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rubbish.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you say that online is better than in person that says more about
the (low) quality of your teaching than it does about the quality of
online tech teaching resources.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I mean, it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that anything you can do online you can do
in person since you can still avail yourselves of the same tech tools
while you can also do the in person live stuff. Online you&amp;#39;ve only got
online.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking at it another way, is an online show, concert, or sporting
event (weather notwithstanding) ever better than the live thing?
There&amp;#39;s something about in person even when you take away the
connection between teacher and students and students and students that
makes it special.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While online isn&amp;#39;t better there are times where it&amp;#39;s necessary or can
be used to complement or enhance in person. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hunter hasn&amp;#39;t made any announcements about any closings due to COVID19
but it would be foolish not to prepare. I also want to figure out if
some of my CS Teacher Certification program can be offered remotely as
not all interested teachers can get to campus. For these reasons and a
few more, I think I&amp;#39;d like to try to do at least a couple of my
classes remotely over the next few of weeks (sooner if it&amp;#39;s forced
upon us).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Technology shouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem - all my students get a laptop as
part of the Daedalus program. The only questions are will they have
sufficient bandwidth if they&amp;#39;re joining from home and if they have a
suitable location from where they can connect in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As part of Hunter&amp;#39;s School of Education I can use Zoom and that has
the video conferencing, chat, screen sharing and whiteboarding. The
only thing I have to workout  is how to use the breakout room features
for group work and to see if that can flow nicely in the class. I&amp;#39;ve
got a couple of lessons that should work pretty well as first time
experiments so overall it should be pretty easy to give it a go.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Will it be as good as live? No. Will it be better than nothing?
Absolutely. Is it worth burning a live class to learn a bit about
online - to see what can be done without extensive training and class
prep and to see what can be leveraged in a pinch? I think so.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If it happens, I&amp;#39;ll report back.
&lt;/p&gt;
