      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I spent the last couple of days attending &lt;a href=&#34;http://go.personaldemocracy.com/&#34;&gt;Personal Democracy Forum
2016&lt;/a&gt;, described on their landing site as:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The worldâ€™s leading conference exploring and analyzing technology&amp;#39;s
impact on politics, government, and society.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s the reason why I haven&amp;#39;t posted my latest Emacs video.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
PDF is a great conference and raised a huge number of important
issues. I&amp;#39;ll probably blog about a few over the next few weeks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One topic that I&amp;#39;ve already lamented about has been the way we as a
society are allowing so much information to be silo-ed in platforms
like Facebook.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I use Facebook as much as the next guy but it always irks me when I
see a CS Education post followed by rich discussion hidden within
Facebook&amp;#39;s walls and not available for discovery to the outside world
and the future.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I generally don&amp;#39;t get a lot of comments on my posts, but when I do,
more appear in the Facebook link to my post rather than publicly on
the post itself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the conference, we watched a video by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hossein_Derakhshan&#34;&gt;Hossein Derakhshan&lt;/a&gt; which
talked about the direction the web is moving in and the red flags it
should raise with all of us. He echoed my concerns and beyond but in a much more
eloquent way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m urging you to take the less than ten minutes to watch this
video. I know school&amp;#39;s winding down for all of us but for those of you
who are teachers out there - share this with your students. I&amp;#39;m sure a
rich discussion will follow.
&lt;/p&gt;
