        div.center {text-align:center;}   As a teacher, sometimes your gut tells you to do something and it turns out to be a really good idea.  That's what happened in October, 1994. I decided to dress up as Groo the Wanderer for Halloween. I never dressed in costume for school before and back then, no many did. A few students and very few teachers.  Afterwards, I noticed that my younger students - the ones that didn't know me that well yet, really loosened up and so a tradition was born.

It's another bad idea that we refuse to let die. Eight years ago JonAlf joked that someone in class joked that they should have a party and they should all get dressed up. My thought? "YEAH!!! LET'S DO IT!

That was the subject of the email Brian sent with the photo above. What's going on?  We're working on advanced JavaScript while also looking at Backbone.js.  Now, as sometimes happens, Batya, while in her CS class up at college, decided to open up a Google chat with me.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   About a month ago, I was at my 30 year high school reunion. Yesterday I was at the class of 2009's 5 year one. Stuy 2004 also had their 10 year reunion last night.  It's always nice to be invited to reunions - I know it's largely dependent on who's on the organizing committee but it's nice to be remembered.  Last time I wrote about Stuy reunions I noted how similar they all are.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   That's how I introduce myself whenever I attend a former student's wedding. It leads to all sorts of confusion.  Even better was the time I was at the wedding of two former students. I had just dropped around 65 pounds and was wearing my hair differently. I sat at a table filled with former students that didn't recognize me &#x2013; they had no reason to expect me, out of context and all.

Traditionally, math team coaches from around the city descend on Stuy for a day full of lectures, discussion, and general catching up. I've never actually attended these meetings. In the past, they were for math team coaches only and this year, I was actually allowed to do something with the CS teachers.
