    </header>

    <div class="content post-summary">
        It took a while but we&#39;re finally here. Hunter College is launching it&#39;s Computer Science Teacher Certification programs. This was the second big initiative I&#39;ve been working on at Hunter. The first was the Daedalus undergraduate CS scholars program. The Daedalus program started my first year and is now providing the best value (and in my opinion best) undergraduate CS opportunity in New York.  CS Certification took longer. I had to design the programs, they had to make it through the whole CUNY governance process which even under ideal circumstances takes around a year and then up through NYSED.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        Presenting at CSTA 2020   I noticed a few tweets and posts from people announcing that they&#39;d be presenting at CSTA2020 - the big computer science teachers conference held every July.  A common thread in a few of these were trepidation&#39;s presenters. Excited to be doing this but nervous.  It&#39;s interesting that teachers, myself included, sometimes get nervous before presentations even though we present every day as part of our jobs.

        Out of class student communication is always a challenge. There are plenty of options:    Piazza    Facebook group    Slack, Discord, or other chat system    Discourse, Vanilla or other discussion forum system    Mailing list    but all have warts.  I shared my thoughts on a number of these options a while ago but thought I&#39;d update them now.

        When I wrote about the HighWebEd I mentioned John William&#39;&#39;s talk on Agile.

&mdash; Mark Guzdial (@guzdial) October 14, 2019   I&#39;m glad Mark wrote about this as it&#39;s something that&#39;s important to both research and publicize but it&#39;s really not a surprise.  I&#39;m going to start by dismissing the statement that &#34;… participation in the Aspirations awards program were teh best predictors of persistence three years after the high school survey in both CS and other technology-related majors.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        Alfred Thompson posted today about cheating on CS class projects. It was in response to Garth Flint&#39;s post on finding interesting projects which in turn referenced earlier posts by Alfred and me.  Garth laments that it&#39;s hard to find projects that are both interesting and meaty but where solutions can&#39;t easily be searched for online. Alfred notes that cheating will happen and that it&#39;s an ethics issue. This is why I try to create a culture of sharing and acknowledging credit (that is, citing sources) but I&#39;m not naive enough to believe there isn&#39;t any cheating in my classes.

        There are things we do in school and there are things we do in industry and they&#39;re not always the same. In school we might use a learning language or an IDE which gives additional support and at times even take away language features while at work you might you might make heavy use of continuous integration tools.  On the other hand, sometimes we use the same things. Java is used in schools and in industry, StackOverflow consulted in both and many schools use professional IDEs like Eclipse.

        I recently did a unit where I had my students convert words into Pig Latin. I like the problem because to start it only requires strings, functions and if statements but there is some depth to the unit.  We start with simplified rules:    If the word starts with a vowel, add &#34;ay&#34; to the end of the word    If it starts with a consonant move the first latter to the end and add &#34;ay&#34;    don&#39;t worry about anything else    Students usually start with something like this:    as students realize it&#39;s much easier to check for vowels rather than consonants.

They say they&#39;ll eventually have solutions but since the site appears to be at least a few years old, who knows it they&#39;ll ever publish them.  One interesting thing about the site is that it really doesn&#39;t have a lot of content to teach you the concepts around the challenges.

        I was planning on writing up all the exciting CS Education work I got to be involved in these past two days but I saw a post on one of the CS discussion forums that got me riled.  There&#39;s a teacher (name withheld to protect the innocent) who wants to create an advanced course for his students but his administration is requesting an outside measure of accountability. This sounds reasonable on the surface but I found it really insulting.
