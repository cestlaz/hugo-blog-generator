      <title>Reopening Schools - de Blasio and Carranza throw kids and teachers under the bus.</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/reopening-schools/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Jul 2020 08:18:21 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, Bill de Blasio and Richard Carranza unveiled their open the
schools in the fall plan. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The plan is perfectly consistent with de Blasio and Carranza&amp;#39;s
education policies and efforts in general - tone deaf, ineffective,
and in this case, unsafe.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know we were told that part of this came from survey results but we
all know that surveys are super easy to fix. I mean, ask any teacher
or parent &amp;#34;do you want schools to be open and in person in the Fall?&amp;#34;
and everyone will say &amp;#34;yes.&amp;#34; Of course, there&amp;#39;s the implication that
it&amp;#39;s safe and I bet that part didn&amp;#39;t make it in to the surveys.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t watch the news conference live, but I was told that while
principals, parents, and children were mentioned over and over as
consulted constituents when forming the plan, somehow teachers never
came up. Typical.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The basics of the plan is that students could go all remote or hybrid
and under the hybrid model, they&amp;#39;d be in the schools some days and not
others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Does this address health concerns? Doubtful. They&amp;#39;re talking about a
third to half the students attending at a time. Take a look at any
school on opening and closing - it&amp;#39;s wall to wall from the school to
the subway. It&amp;#39;s a mess. Many schools are already split schedule -
they have their kids entry and egress staggered into halves or thirds
and the beginning and end of days there are &lt;strong&gt;STILL&lt;/strong&gt; wall to wall for
blocks not to mention the subway platforms and cars. Even 1/3 isn&amp;#39;t
going to do it and the more you stagger, the more you lengthen the
school days and this affects both staff and families. What good is
having a kid go to school so you can work if they don&amp;#39;t start until
mid day?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s assume, although I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a safe assumption, that you
can get the kids to and from school safety. How big are the
classrooms? I heard that some Stuy teacher&amp;#39;s measured them and they
could safely accommodate something like 9 -  12 people. That&amp;#39;s in line
with what DbD said but what about transfer between classes? Some
schools - particularly those in converted spaces have TINY halls or
limited stairwells. What about bathrooms? None of this has been
addressed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about cleaning? Teachers have regularly begged for basic
supplies. Schools go without necessities like toilet paper and the
Mayor&amp;#39;s saying that we&amp;#39;ll have sufficient masks and cleaning supplies?
Good luck with that! 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if we have the supplies, will they be used and used correctly and
often enough? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about compliance? For years, schools had a &amp;#34;no hats&amp;#34; policy but
rarely are there no hats. Even when the policy works, usually it&amp;#39;s a
result of teachers continually asking students to remove their
hats. How did those cell phone bans work? Do we really believe we can
get 100% compliance from students, teachers, and staff? What about the
younger grades? We really expect them to comply with adult
protocols?????
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if everything is implemented, will it keep everyone safe?
Unlikely. Professional and big time college sports have extreme
incentive to &amp;#34;open up&amp;#34;, boatloads of money and everyone pulling in the
same direction. They test all the time, have all the space they need
and can implement whatever protocols they want. Even with all this we
keep hearing about new cases in those populations. If they can&amp;#39;t do it
how can underfunded schools?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With all of this, even if it&amp;#39;s safe and even if schools can manage
reasonable schedules, students will only be going to school a couple
of times a week - will this really help parents? Maybe not. I remember
when we had Batya. We were looking for child care for just a couple of
days a week. Five days was easy, no days was easy but just a couple -
not so much. What about the shifted days? Large schools might need 4
shifts. Kids either start and end super early or super late. Will that
help parents who work &amp;#34;regular time&amp;#34; jobs?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, let&amp;#39;s get to the education side of things. High school
teachers teach five classes a day. Around 34 kids in a class. Given
room size restrictions that  means we have to split into threes. If
one teacher has to deal with this then it&amp;#39;s a HUGE increase in
work. If kids come to school on different days they&amp;#39;ll get different
live lessons - for each class teachers will have to make at least one
in person lesson and at least one corresponding remote lesson and I&amp;#39;m
over simplifying. Since you&amp;#39;re now &amp;#34;teaching&amp;#34; 10 or 15 classes instead
of 5 I don&amp;#39;t see how you can meet with them in person and deliver
synchronous remote instruction which means you&amp;#39;re only actually
interacting with your students once or twice a week and there&amp;#39;s no way
teachers will be able to actually develop materials, assess students,
and maintain meaningful contact unless someone finds a whole lot of
hours to the day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, if the teacher just does the in person and another
or other teachers do the remote you&amp;#39;ll have multiple teachers teaching
a single class without any real coordination  - this is yet another
recipe for disaster.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I get it - we all want to get back to normal. I want to be with my
students but I want to be with them safely. I also get that some
students are not doing well in isolation and that remote school is
both less effective than in person and a hardship all around but when
we open it has to make sense both in terms of safety and in terms of
education. de Blasio and Carranza&amp;#39;s plan is neither.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why are police held to such a lower standard than teachers?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-police-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 12:36:04 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
My friend Neal Zupancic, actually former student, friend, and long
time teacher Neal Zupancic posted this on Facebook. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s 100% spot on. I&amp;#39;d add my two cents but Neal captured it better
than I ever could. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Take a minute to read it:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my ten years of teaching, I&amp;#39;ve dealt with a number of situations
that could have potentially turned dangerous.  I&amp;#39;ve taught in public
schools and private; urban schools and rural.  I have de-escalated
every last one of those situations.  I have never once used force.  I
once broke up a fist fight using only my voice and my presence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve never felt the need to announce that before, because it&amp;#39;s just a
part of my profession.  Every teacher knows it and most of the public
knows as well.  And there are teachers who have been in far more
dangerous situations than I have.  Teachers who deal with gang
activity, drug dealers, kids who bring weapons to school with the
intent to use them, kids who fight and don&amp;#39;t necessarily stop when you
show up.  I know teachers who have been assaulted by students.  I know
teachers who have been threatened by students, including with deadly
weapons.  Every teacher is expected to deal with every one of these
situations without using force or violence.  Some of us are
well-trained, and some of us are thrown in and just go on instinct.
But we de-escalate.  We calm.  We soothe.  We help.  We repair and
restore the community.  We heal people.  We build an environment in
which those we are responsible for can thrive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I keep seeing people ask &amp;#34;who would want to be a cop if you could get
fired for doing your job?&amp;#34;  But literally any teacher could do that
job without killing people.  Literally any teacher would have had the
patience to talk George Floyd into getting into that police car
instead of tossing him on the ground and murdering him.  Literally any
teacher would have let Rayshard Brooks get away rather than shooting
him dead, knowing that the system would provide accountability for his
resisting arrest and that you didn&amp;#39;t have to be his executioner.
Literally any teacher knows that by the time you are in a power
struggle with a student, you have already lost.
Literally. any. teacher.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I hear these cops whining on social media and it sickens me.  They
wouldn&amp;#39;t last a day teaching.  And of course we see that when we see
how often cops in schools arrest kids for routine behavior problems
that teachers could have solved peacefully.  We already know cops
can&amp;#39;t handle teenagers without resorting to force.  We already know
cops in schools exacerbate racism and inequality - just like they do
outside of schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And the reason for that is that we fire teachers who can&amp;#39;t control
their tempers.  We fire teachers who use force rather than let them
stay on the job and keep escalating that force until they kill
someone.  We &lt;strong&gt;weed out&lt;/strong&gt; the bad apples.  And no teacher would ever
dream of protesting or walking off the job in support of someone who
got fired for assaulting a student.  Are you kidding me?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m reading posts in teacher&amp;#39;s groups about going back to school in
fall - or in some cases, in July or August to extend the school year -
without adequate protection from coronavirus, without enough room in
their halls and classrooms to socially distance, without funding for
hand sanitizer or wipes or masks, without training or PD on blended or
distance learning, without promised raises because municipalities have
lost tax revenue because of corona - and then I see cops who walk
around in body armor and work for departments that own tanks, whining
about how hard their jobs are because they&amp;#39;re finally catching flak
for shooting people, and it&amp;#39;s like - what are your priorities?  Where
is your perspective?  What kind of society do you expect to raise into
the next generation when you&amp;#39;ll fund a militarized occupying force
with impunity for homicide but you won&amp;#39;t buy teachers masks and
sanitizer during a pandemic?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And teachers never, ever, ever whine like these cops do.  My
&lt;strong&gt;students&lt;/strong&gt; don&amp;#39;t even whine like these cops do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Seriously - where do they find these people?  Our job is a hundred
times harder and if we mess up even once the way cops do every day,
we&amp;#39;re out in a heartbeat.  And yet if I whined about it the way cops
whine about it, people would say &amp;#34;hey man, maybe you should stfu and
find a different job.&amp;#34;  And they&amp;#39;d be right.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So to all the cops out there who think they have it rough: You ain&amp;#39;t
nothing compared to a teacher.  STFU and find a different job.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Future consequences of today&#39;s grading policies</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/grading-consequences/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 07:08:12 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/grading-consequences/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
How are we going to deal with grades? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This has garnered a lot of attention since COVID-19 struck.  Over on
the AP side people wonder if colleges will give credit? Do the tests
mean anything? What about the material they won&amp;#39;t be testing? We also
have had standardized tests canceled and a variety of grading
policies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m going to stay away from AP this time around - you all know my
feelings about the college board. I will leave you with a couple of
good posts though that share many of my views (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/views/2020/05/26/ap-courses-do-not-deserve-college-credit-opinion&#34;&gt;AP Courses don&amp;#39;t
deserve college credit&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&#34;https://jd2718.org/2020/05/18/retiring-advanced-placement/&#34;&gt; Retiring Advanced Placement&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The bottom line is that student and teachers lives have been severely
disrupted  since early March. In NYC public schools that means three
to four months which is a considerable chunk of the semester. In
college the percent is slightly less but it&amp;#39;s still a good chunk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some students have done fine but many have had difficulty and I&amp;#39;d
venture a guess to say most won&amp;#39;t end the semester in the same place
they would have under normal circumstances.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about this as a result of Hunter&amp;#39;s policy and I
don&amp;#39;t really have a good answer. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hunter decided that instructors would award grades as they normally
would. Each instructor would follow their own counsel on how to
grade. Should they be super lenient due to circumstances? Extra hard
because of perceived cheating (don&amp;#39;t get me started on this), same old
same old or some other method. Once grades were awarded, students have
the ability to change any or all classes to pass/fail. Normally if a
student takes a class pass/fail it can&amp;#39;t be used as a prerequisite or
to fill a major requirement but for this past semester, it can. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Overall I like this policy - it gives the students most of the control
and they don&amp;#39;t have to decide on anything until after the fact. The
bad part comes in though with the any passed class counting as a
prerequisite of for the major. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s say I have a student in CS1 who was doing well but really
struggled at the end after we went remote. Maybe that student was
doing A or B work up to the switch but basically got nothing out of
the rest of the semester. I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to fail the student. Under
normal circumstances, we make the false assumption that the grade is
entirely the result of the student and factors surrounding the
student&amp;#39;s environment. Even if that assumption were 100% true the Covid
Curve Ball was not the students fault and the negative impact to their
studies could not only be due to their circumstances but also due to
actions of the college or the way the instructor reacted to the
circumstances. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With Hunter&amp;#39;s policy, I could award any passing grade - even a D and
the student could convert it to a Pass and move on to CS2. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The danger here is that the student might not be prepared for CS2. We
cover memory pointers, memory management, and classes at the end of
CS1. So much of CS2 is built on pointer based programs that a student
who missed out on that in CS1 is going to struggle mightily. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You might say that the kid could have retaken CS1 but there&amp;#39;s a wrench
in the works. If the kid failed CS1 they could retake it. With a Pass
they can&amp;#39;t. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A student could, with the permission of some instructor audit the
missed parts of CS1 or self study but we know that won&amp;#39;t always
happen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The alternative is to award a failing grade to the student which would
then hurt their GPA and force them to retake the entire course.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You might say that the school could just adjust the curricula for next
year but it&amp;#39;s not that simple. In high school most students progress
in lockstep. In college there&amp;#39;s more variation. Next semester&amp;#39;s CS2
will have students who completed CS1 this past semester under the
cloud of COVID-19, students who completed it on the Fall, some from
summer and some from other places. This is where curricular
consistency is somewhat more important.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I do like Hunter&amp;#39;s policy and I do think it&amp;#39;s on the side of the
student but I&amp;#39;m not happy about this loophole.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This probably won&amp;#39;t affect a huge number of students but some will
fall through the cracks. As I said, I don&amp;#39;t have a good answer but it
is something I&amp;#39;m really concerned about.
&lt;/p&gt;

Preamble
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve never accepted a guest post before but when my friend and long
time colleague JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver said he had something to say I
was all for it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
JonAlf&amp;#39;s one of the best teachers I know - he started at Brandeis HS and
has been at Stuy forever. Really sharp guy, great teacher, and really
perceptive. When he has something to say it&amp;#39;s 100% worth listening
to. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To JonAlf - since I know this is one of my blog posts you&amp;#39;ll actually
read - you should set up a blog of your own. The community would be
all the better for it.
&lt;/p&gt;

Missing out on a great opportunity in education
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
By JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, educators across the nation are
adapting to remote learning. I’ve watched my colleagues work hard
putting together plans on how to deliver content, engage students and
assess their learning. Some, like myself, are combining multiple tools
in order to achieve these goals while others are using a single
platform for it all. I count myself lucky that the administration in
my school has given its teachers the leeway to select their own tools
instead of forcing a single platform on us. Last week, as I was
thinking through what my plan was going to be, a particular thought
kept nagging at me:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We are facing an amazing opportunity in the world of education. Think
of how many lessons, worksheets, notes, examples, etc. are being put
out in some electronic form.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-5&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Students will (hopefully) have access to the materials for their
classes, and teachers in the same school may also be able to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-6&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will never be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about the teacher three states away that’s struggling to find good resources or new problems?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-7&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will never be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about the student in a different district, perhaps one that has
shut down entirely, who just wants to learn and do some work in order
to help fill the days?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-8&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will never be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The internet gives us the ability to put all of these resources out
there to the public, and it pains me to think about how much of this
work is going to be hidden behind one platform or another. So many of
the educational technologies make it very easy to post work for your
class and very hard, if not impossible, to share it with other people
(you’re school doesn’t also have a license for XYZ?, sorry).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, there are many teachers out there that have no choice, they
are being mandated to use whatever the school decrees. There are
others, perhaps the less technically savvy, that are going to use
whatever they can get trained on quickly. We’re all running a 2 minute
drill and working with what we have. I get that, and it is not a
teacher’s job to provide materials for everyone. That being said, If
you have the knowhow, or would like to learn, there are ways to make
your work publicly available. Last summer Mike and I ran a session at
the CSTA conference on using GitHub for just this purpose, and hope to
run a workshop on it this summer (For those interested, I made a brief
tutorial about how to do this.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teachers Pay Teachers - part 2 - the report</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-pay-teachers-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2020 10:03:27 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-pay-teachers-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Continuing from yesterday, what about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.govtech.com/computing/Report-Most-Teacher-Created-Online-English-Materials-Subpar.html&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/research/supplemental-curriculum-bazaar&#34;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on pay
and free teacher resources.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The report looked at three sources - one pay and two free. They came
up with a number of results but I think they largely missed the point.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Their bottom line conclusion was that &amp;#39;Overall, reviewers rate most
of the materials as “mediocre” or “probably not worth using”.&amp;#39; They
also didn&amp;#39;t seem to find that neither the for profit or free sources
were universally better.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The one thing I can agree with though is that a consistent rating
system for the types of resources found on these sites would be very
helpful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think the main problem with the report has to do with what they were
looking for. They concluded things like the resources didn&amp;#39;t line up
well with standards, didn&amp;#39;t have good assessments, didn&amp;#39;t address
cultural diversity and a few other &amp;#34;didn&amp;#39;t dos,&amp;#34;  As I said, I think they
missed the point.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It felt to me that the reviewers were looking for rote
experiences. Download a lesson and follow the script.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In spite of what reformers would have you think, that isn&amp;#39;t
teaching. A teacher new to a class might start with a well worked out
curriculum and largely follow it verbatim but as they develop their
chops they&amp;#39;ll want the curriculum and all related materials to become
their own.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A downloaded resource, taken as is, will likely not address a specific
classes cultural diversity, at least not more than in the general
sense because it was designed for the authors class and that&amp;#39;s a good
thing. It&amp;#39;s up to the person doing the downloading to take the
resource and then adapt it for their students in their situation. This
is why most of the items that the report considers bad to me are both
inevitable and fine. There is no universal lesson that you can cut and
paste to all schools. To expect it is rubbish.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the CS side, there&amp;#39;s a good amount of sharing of materials as well
as providers well, providing content. Some is free some not but there
is a lot available. Forgetting about whole curricula resources, three
lesson / experience sites  I&amp;#39;m
reasonably familiar with are the SIGCSE &lt;a href=&#34;http://nifty.stanford.edu/&#34;&gt;Nifty Assignments&lt;/a&gt; and now the
CSTA&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/cstaniftyassignments/&#34;&gt;corresponding project&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.engage-csedu.org/&#34;&gt;Engage CS&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The biggest problem with the Nifty sites is that they&amp;#39;re arranged
chronologically by the conference year they were presented. There are
no tags nor easy way to search.  Engage CS gives you some level of
searching like for course level, keyword, resource type, and more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The sites present resources in a format that&amp;#39;s superficially
 consistent but the truth is, once you get past the headings they can
 be written up in radically different ways.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To me, that&amp;#39;s not a problem. Each resource was written by some
educator with the intent of sharing but since each author is unique so
to will be the content they produce. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The real value of all these resources are to get ideas - lesson
motivations, code samples, project ideas etc.. Sure, I wish they were
more discoverable via search - better tagged and yes, even better
rated but the value is from reading what some other teacher has done
and then pulling out aspects that can work for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve rarely used a Nifty Assignment nor something from EngageCS
explicitly but I have gotten value from both sites (CSTA Nifty
assignments are newer and I&amp;#39;ve been at all the CSTA sessions so
haven&amp;#39;t actually used the site). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Would I ever use a resources &amp;#34;as published?&amp;#34; Perhaps - if
it was really well aligned with how I do things. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Would I pay? Probably not. I&amp;#39;m not against paying for resources from a
philosophical point of view. Charge a fair price and give a reasonable
assurance that what you&amp;#39;re selling has value and provide some value
beyond the free sites. I haven&amp;#39;t used Teachers Pay Teachers and
probably won&amp;#39;t look at Amazon&amp;#39;s thing when it&amp;#39;s launched but to me,
they would have to bring value in terms of curation and search. If
they do at a fair price, then they may be worth using.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I started teaching there was no public internet. None of this
existed. Teachers kept binders or books of lesson plans and if you
were lucky you could borrow from a friend or colleague. New York&amp;#39;s DOE
at one point had a few teachers in each subject area submit lesson
plans for &amp;#34;lesson books&amp;#34; which they published for each core
subject. My chairman wrote some of the math ones and those materials
largely got me through my first year. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today we have an embarrassment of riches. That comes with the price
that we have to actually read and evaluate all of the materials we&amp;#39;re
presented with but I&amp;#39;ll take today&amp;#39;s resources over what I started with
any day.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teachers Pay Teachers  - part 1 - should they</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-pay-teachers/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2020 08:43:37 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-pay-teachers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There was a bit of buzz a couple of months ago when Amazon announced
an online marketplace for educational resources. It wasn&amp;#39;t a new
concept - on the pay side, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/?msclkid=a426c2c1625613061bc19ce4cdcb6a0a&amp;amp;utm_source=bing&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Search%2520-%2520Branded%2520-%2520Desktop&amp;amp;utm_term=teachers%2520pay%2520teachers&amp;amp;utm_content=Brand%2520Name&#34;&gt;Teachers Pay Teachers&lt;/a&gt; has been around for a
while and in terms of free, there are many online resources but
they&amp;#39;re not necessarily well organized or curated. What was the buzz?
Should teachers be charging their peers for class materials or should
they be providing them for free.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was going to blog about it then but never got around to it The other
day, someone posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.govtech.com/computing/Report-Most-Teacher-Created-Online-English-Materials-Subpar.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article which questioned the quality of both
free resources and pay ones. The article, based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/research/supplemental-curriculum-bazaar&#34;&gt;this report&lt;/a&gt; by the
Fordham Institute looked at ELA resources. The report also only looked
at Teachers Pay Teachers and two free sites - ReadWriteThink and Share
My Lesson excluding many other teacher resources that could be, for
all we know, better curated and more discoverable. As an aside, I was
turned off by the reports referring to their evaluators as &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34;
which is a description I personally would question. Still, there&amp;#39;s
some good fodder for thought.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll get to the report in the next post but for now let&amp;#39;s tackle the
question that started the initial buzz - should teachers be charging
each other for materials?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It depends. If you&amp;#39;re paid by a school to develop materials they
belong to the school. In NY you can take a sabbatical to build a
course so anything you build during that time would be DOE property
and therefore you couldn&amp;#39;t sell it. Same thing if you&amp;#39;re being paid
off hours to develop materials. The gray area comes when you&amp;#39;re lesson
planning. Most real planning and development happens outside of
school hours. In an typical school day teacher are typically
allocated around 40 minutes to do all their planing, grading,
and paperwork so realistically most materials as well as planing,
paperwork, and grading are done off hours. This being the case, I&amp;#39;m of
the belief that those materials belong to the teacher (although I&amp;#39;ve
met some DOE educrats who would disagree).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, should they sell it? Well, they have every right to. That said, my
personal feelings and practice is that if you&amp;#39;ve developed something
for yourself and have not spent extra time or effort to prepare it for
others then I think you should make it freely available to your
peers. On the other hand, if you spend extra time and effort to make
it useful for and usable by others then by all means charge if you&amp;#39;d
like.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll tackle the report in the next post and we&amp;#39;ll look at some of the
resources available on the CS side.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Education is not a spectator sport</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/education-not-spec-sport/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2020 08:07:26 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/education-not-spec-sport/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
As many of you know, the CS Education programs I designed here at
Hunter were finally approved by NY State late last year. We&amp;#39;re
planning to get started this summer. I&amp;#39;ve received many questions
about the program and will write up the details here sooner or later
but one question I frequently get is &amp;#34;will it be offered online?&amp;#34; This
is also something I&amp;#39;ve been asked more than once internal to Hunter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some of these requests make sense - we&amp;#39;re in the heart of NYC so
someone out on Long Island or further afield upstate won&amp;#39;t be able to
take our courses in person. This is the advantage of online
education. You can partake, or probably more often, consume it from
anywhere. Leaving out completion rates, that makes things very
attractive. Online is also very popular with bean counters. With it
you can set up practically unlimited class sizes. Lots of potential
profits. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, is it better?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While there are certainly many things you can learn online, is it the
same? Some argue that if a professor is straight out lecturing you
might as well watch the video. Probably true but is a dynamic
professor lecturing online the same as in person?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is a recorded concert the same as attending live? What about a
Broadway show? Sporting event?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll listen to music at home, watch a ballgame or even a recording of
a live show but it isn&amp;#39;t the same. Even when presenter-audience
interaction and audience-audience interaction is at a minimum - say a
classical concert, the live experience is both different, superior,
and more memorable than the memorex.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, there&amp;#39;s certainly value added by augmenting classes with online
content but all too often it&amp;#39;s used for cost cutting or profit
making. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://dianeravitch.net/2019/07/18/oklahoma-legislator-questions-why-state-is-giving-millions-to-virtual-charter-school/&#34;&gt;Virtual&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://dianeravitch.net/2019/08/14/ohio-gets-another-virtual-charter-school/&#34;&gt;Cyber&lt;/a&gt; Charter schools for details.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the day education is not a spectator sport.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 It&amp;#39;s built on the relationship between student, teacher, and
classmates. You can get some of that online and online is great when
there are truly no other alternatives. If we can ever figure out
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/communicating-with_students/&#34;&gt;online engagement&lt;/a&gt;, then technology will be even better at augmenting
(not replacing) good, live instruction. I&amp;#39;m certainly going to look
into offering parts of my classes remotely specifically for people
outside of NY City but we&amp;#39;re a long way from remote education being
even close to as good as in person.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pushback To CS for All</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pushback-to-csforall/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 08:27:20 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pushback-to-csforall/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
On the last day of 2019, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/audreywatters&#34;&gt;Audrey Waters&lt;/a&gt; wrote a great piece on &lt;a href=&#34;https://hackeducation.com/2019/12/31/what-a-shitshow&#34;&gt;The 100
Worst Ed-Tech Debacles of the Decade&lt;/a&gt;. I agree with most of them but
felt it was worth looking at a one in particular. Specifically number 6 -
&amp;#34;Everyone Should earn to Code.&amp;#34;  I might dive in to some others later
but we&amp;#39;ll stick with number 6 for today.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I read over these right after reading two recent posts by Alina Adam&amp;#39;s
son Gregory - a sophomore at Stuyvesant High School over on Alina&amp;#39;s blog
&lt;a href=&#34;https://newyorkschooltalk.org/2019/12/what-is-computer-science-the-doe-doesnt-know-cs4all-part-2/&#34;&gt;questioning NYC&amp;#39;s CS For All initiative&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Audrey made some very good points on CS for All (or everyone should
learn to code). It&amp;#39;s industry driven - giving them more of an outsized
influence over education and she questions the tech job crisis. I&amp;#39;ll
personally add that it&amp;#39;s problematic that so much of the emphasis -
particularly in the public schools is CS for jobs. I get it - a well
paying job is a ticket up the economic ladder and this can be a huge
deal for low income families. That said, it&amp;#39;s problematic at best when
the attitude is education for jobs for the poor and well rounded
education for life for  the rich.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While Audrey wrote on 100 items a few paragraphs each, Gregory wrote two
posts on CS for All in NYC and pushed back hard. One line that
resonated with me was his response to the DOE&amp;#39;s claim that &amp;#34; “Students
with computer science degrees are some of the highest-paid college
graduates”  responding with:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#34;You know what else is a very useful skill for jobs and graduating
college? Reading comprehension and basic mathematics skills.&amp;#34; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was a sticking point with me that got me in trouble with DOE on
the AFSE project. They insisted the high school would create industry
ready software engineers our of high school in spite of them coming in
well below grade level. They were wrong. CS is not a substitute for
other important subjects. I personally do think CS for All is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; 
important and I&amp;#39;ll address that shortly but I view it as one more
fundamental - in addition to reading and writing not at the expense
of.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now let me push back on the pushback.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
CS as a K12 academic discipline is very young. In NYC, things didn&amp;#39;t
really get rolling until &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fredwilson&#34;&gt;Fred Wilson&lt;/a&gt; (from industry) started to push
things around 10 years go. There were some other small efforts at individual
schools and regions around the country. The national movement, in
spite of the CSTA being in existence for twenty years or more  didn&amp;#39;t
gain any real traction until code.org came onto the scene - also driven by
industry. While I agree very much with Audrey and other&amp;#39;s concerns
about industry&amp;#39;s outsized influence and have publicly criticized
code.org and others on it without Fred, CS Ed doesn&amp;#39;t happen in NYC
and without Hadi Partovi I&amp;#39;d guess that there wouldn&amp;#39;t be the national
push either.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is all to say that the field is young so addressing what I think
are Gregory&amp;#39;s core points, depending on the teacher, a student&amp;#39;s CS
experience can be a total waste of time or it can be life changing in
a good way. This is also true of other subject areas. A bad teacher
can destroy a kid in any subject area as much as good one can
uplift. This will be more of a problem in CS until the system starts
to produce properly prepared teachers - teachers who know both the CS
content and how to teach it. That will take some time and we&amp;#39;re
starting to do that at Hunter. On the other hand, we&amp;#39;ll never get
there unless we start. In the long run, CS teachers should be of
comparable quality to teachers of other disciplines which is, of
course, another can of worms to dig into.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Putting that aside, I&amp;#39;ll also push back on the pushback that teaching
CS isn&amp;#39;t valuable for everyone and I&amp;#39;ll do that on two fronts. The
first is in response to Gregory&amp;#39;s contention that &amp;#34;Computer science will
have very few applications for most people later in life.&amp;#34; While most
people won&amp;#39;t become professional programmers or software engineers
many (most?) people will work with data. It could be some deep
analysis or it could be merely managing company or personal
contacts. A rudimentary background in programming allows one to
automate data processing and focus on the core task. A much simpler
example of this is typing when writing. If you can type, you can focus
fully on the content you&amp;#39;re producing. If you can&amp;#39;t your focus is
split - part on the content and part on the keys. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We teach a variety of subjects. We teach languages in spite of the
fact that we don&amp;#39;t require students learn them to fluency. Everyone
has to take some classes in the arts, multiple sciences, economics,
math - some of which makes sense and some maybe not so much, English
and more. Is CS any less important than taking a smattering of French?
How about Algebra 2 and Trig?  A year of bio, chem, and physics?
Students should be exposed to many fields and I think it would be hard
for an honest person to say that CS is less important that every
single one of the other required classes we force upon our
students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When students are struggling with fundamentals - math/English some
want to put more resources into them - usually at the expense of the
arts - there are many people, myself included that feel that this is a
 &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; mistake. All our students should be entitled to a well rounded
education. They should take art and music, and have the opportunity to
learn an instrument. They should be exposed to a myriad of subjects,
ways of thinking, and yes, things that will lead to possible career
paths. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
CS is one of these subjects. It&amp;#39;s just the new kid on the block. This is
the other reason why CS for All (beyond &amp;#34;Eveveryone should program&amp;#34;)
is so important. It&amp;#39;s not that CS should replace art or music or
another important subject but that our students deserve to be exposed
to it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some will quibble that there&amp;#39;s no room but, at least in NY State
there is - I looked over the requirements and in fact, you can have 3
years of CS in High School along with all the requirements plus a
couple of other electives but I&amp;#39;m not advocating for that. I&amp;#39;m also
not sure that NY&amp;#39;s plan to have CS at every &amp;#34;grade band&amp;#34; is the right
way to go. I think that if you have the right experience you can do
right by the kids in a one year, single period high school
introduction to CS that includes programming (and I&amp;#39;m not talking
APCS-P). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, there it is. CS For All or programming for everyone might end up a
debacle and NYC&amp;#39;s CS For All might turn out to be a waste in spite of
the hard work of many strong educators but if that&amp;#39;s the case it&amp;#39;s
going to be due to implementation, politics, and influence not because
all our students won&amp;#39;t benefit from learning CS.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cheating on CS projects</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/cheating-on-projects/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2019 17:33:02 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/cheating-on-projects/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Alfred Thompson posted today about &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2019/09/the-problem-of-cheating-on-programming.html&#34;&gt;cheating on CS class projects&lt;/a&gt;. It
was in response to Garth Flint&amp;#39;s post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://gflint.wordpress.com/2019/09/26/finding-cool-projects-for-programming-classes/&#34;&gt;finding interesting projects&lt;/a&gt;
which in turn referenced earlier posts by Alfred and me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Garth laments that it&amp;#39;s hard to find projects that are both
interesting and meaty but where solutions can&amp;#39;t easily be searched for
online. Alfred notes that cheating will happen and that it&amp;#39;s an ethics
issue. This is why I try to create a culture of sharing and
acknowledging credit (that is, citing sources) but I&amp;#39;m not naive
enough to believe there isn&amp;#39;t any cheating in my classes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t go nuts looking out for cheating but there are a number of
things I do to try to help keep the students honest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Class time. More often than not students have some time in class to
work on any given project. This lets me get a handle on what they
actually know since I can interact with the student or team and
observe them interacting with each other. Even if a particular
project is all done out of class, over the course of the semester
you can get a pretty good idea as to what a student will produce on
their own.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Project quizzes. For a big project, I&amp;#39;ll sometimes give a quiz on
the day it&amp;#39;s due. The quiz will be tied to the project - describe
a data structure or algorithm you used. If the student wrote the
project it&amp;#39;s free points, if not they&amp;#39;ll have problems. Of course,
this only requires that a student understands their project not
that they actually wrote it but at least that&amp;#39;s something.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Git logs. I get my students on GitHub early and that lets me look
at the commit logs for any given project. This usually can&amp;#39;t be
used to find cheating but it lets me see what was committed when. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Be reasonable in terms of workload and expectations. &lt;strong&gt;This is a
really important one&lt;/strong&gt;. Back at Stuy, it was made clear to me many
times that many students feel forced to cheat due to teachers
expecting far too much from them. If you&amp;#39;re take 6 classes a day
and each gives you two hours of homework somethings got to give.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I always try to give a fair amount of work and only if I think it&amp;#39;s
necessary and makes sense and as long a a student is up front about
any issues that arise I&amp;#39;ll try to work with them on deadlines and
requirements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I could use a code plagiarism tester like &lt;a href=&#34;https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/&#34;&gt;Moss&lt;/a&gt; but I usually don&amp;#39;t
bother.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also try to keep things in perspective. Usually things come clean in
the end. Most classes have multiple measures - tests, homework,
projects, classwork and more. Even if a student copies a project and
gets away with it, it&amp;#39;s just one measure and it likely won&amp;#39;t move the
needle all that much. True, a kid who&amp;#39;s doing well might feel the need
to cheat on one assignment (see item 4 above) but that&amp;#39;s not a hill
I&amp;#39;m willing to die on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if a kid in a 10th grade intro CS class cheats their way through
they&amp;#39;ll unlikely take any more CS as they&amp;#39;ll be woefully
unprepared. In that case, the one higher grade they got on their
transcript due to cheating on CS projects probably won&amp;#39;t make much of
an overall difference and it certainly won&amp;#39;t hurt the kids who take
all your school&amp;#39;s CS courses and apply to college to be CS majors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
None of this is to say that cheating doesn&amp;#39;t happen and I do believe
we should keep an eye out and address it if and when it rares its ugly
head. I&amp;#39;m just saying keep things in perspective. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I pick projects I don&amp;#39;t pay much attention to if they can be
found online and I&amp;#39;m not the tightest screw when it comes to enforcing
the rules in my classes. I know that&amp;#39;s led to my being taken advantage
of over the years and yes, that does bother me but I&amp;#39;d rather put my
time and energy into the kids trying to do it right than those cutting
the corners.
&lt;/p&gt;

There was some buzz over &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/opinion/college-board-sat-ap.html&#34;&gt;this editorial&lt;/a&gt; about the College Board last
week. The two codes every child needs - Coding and the US
Constitution? Who could argue with that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not going to disagree. Civics and CS are important and can&amp;#39;t wait
until college. The thing that left me chilled though was that nobody&amp;#39;s
paying attention to the fact that the College Board - a private entity
with its own interests has so much influence over American education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the piece, Friedman states:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So rather than have SAT exams and Advanced Placement courses based on things that you cram for and forget, they are shifting them, where they can, to promote the “two codes.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 2016, the College Board completely revamped its approach toA.P. computer science courses and exams. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Nothing wrong here but the AP program is supposed to offer &amp;#34;college
level&amp;#34; work in high school. Back when the program started, from 
best I can figure, they offered exams based on courses that were
essentially HS implementations of college classes. Now they&amp;#39;re
flipping the script. They&amp;#39;re dictating what they think should be
taught at the high school level and, oh by the way, it&amp;#39;s college level
because it has the AP designation. The editorial goes into some
details. Now, I&amp;#39;m not against what they&amp;#39;re doing with AP US Gov, it
sounds like a really good idea. I&amp;#39;m against their overall influence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The biggest concern I had though was with this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Besides revamping the government course and the exam on that subject, Coleman and Sanford in 2014 made a staple of the regular SAT a long reading comprehension passage from one of the founding documents, such as the Constitution, or another important piece of democracy, like a great presidential speech. That said to students and teachers something the SAT had never dared say before: Some content is disproportionately more powerful and important, and if you prepare for it you will be rewarded on the SAT.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we put this on the SAT, schools will teach it so the kids will do
better the SAT.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This should be chilling to everyone. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No, I&amp;#39;m not against the details but it&amp;#39;s frightening to have a private
entity with so much influence on public policy like
education. Ultimately, it can&amp;#39;t be good. Just because what the College
Board&amp;#39;s pushing in terms of civics jives with me doesn&amp;#39;t mean they
should be able to influence and manipulate curriculum across the
nation to such a degree. The College Board is pretty much accountable
to nobody. As long as students are told to take AP classes and the
SAT, particularly with politicians and boards of education agreeing to
pay the college board with taxpayers money, the public has very little
say. Sure, more better civics and CS is good but who&amp;#39;s to say the next
initiative will be in the public&amp;#39;s interest?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The same can be said for any of the major education players - for and
non profit alike both in and out of CS. We have to be more aware,
vigilant, and vocal when the power players accomplish things by being
the 800 pound gorilla even when we agree with what some of those
things are.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a big reason why I frequently speak out against the College
Board and other power players, some of whom I greatly like, respect,
and admire, and feel that others should feel obligated to do the same.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tech Jobs, Diversity, and Equity in the wake of the Amazon/NYC debacle</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/tech-jobs-amazon/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Feb 2019 11:14:59 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/tech-jobs-amazon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I was planning on either following up on how I use GitHub classroom or
commenting on the recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/opinion/college-board-sat-ap.html&#34;&gt;NY Times opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; on the College Board
but the follow up, fall out, and polarization from the Amazon NY thing
has been stuck in my head so I thought I&amp;#39;d write a bit more about it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Like my &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/no-amazon-hq/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, this isn&amp;#39;t really about Amazon but rather about
the long game, equity, and diversity and how a lot of people are
fooling themselves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s interesting that the communities I&amp;#39;m in are fairly polarized - my
pure tech world frients are big time upset that the deal fell through while
my pure educator friends, particularly the public school ones, are
really happy things worked out the way they did.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The big disappointment from the tech side revolves largely around the
jobs lost. Lots of tech jobs no longer coming fast and furious. The problem is,
who&amp;#39;s going to fill them. We&amp;#39;ve been hearing for years that there&amp;#39;s a
tech talent problem. Every company at every meetup seems to say &amp;#34;oh,
and we&amp;#39;re hiring,&amp;#34; Google&amp;#39;s expanding as are, as far as I can tell,
most of the other tech giants in the city. How can both be true? If we
need those new jobs now then there must be a glut of tech people
clamoring for employment. If indeed talent is hard to find, how will
NY be able to fill this new need. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We all know the answer - import them. Companies that can have and will go to
the &amp;#34;elite&amp;#34; institutions around the country and try to recruit the
talent to NY. At the end of the day the politicians can look and say
&amp;#34;behold, I have taken this slum and transformed it into a paradise&amp;#34;
and that might technically be true. Problem is that they did it by
further marginalizing and displacing those already on the fringes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s hard to see. When I was younger - before I was deeply immersed in
public education all I saw was the gentrification - look the
neighborhood has gotten better. Now I understand the cost. I&amp;#39;m reminded
of Hofstadter&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%25C3%25B6del,_Escher,_Bach&#34;&gt;GEB&lt;/a&gt; where the anteater is friends with Aunt Hillary -
an ant colony and in fact was an ant surgeon. He &amp;#34;healed&amp;#34; the colony
through strategic amputations. The colony remained healthy but at the
cost of the individuals who didn&amp;#39;t make the cut.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The only way all these high paying tech jobs are going to come from NY
if NY can generate them and the truth is, right now, we can&amp;#39;t.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Colleges nation wide are dealing with capacity issues. At least one
dropped its CS minor - arguably more valuable than a CS major for may
students. Stories abound on how hard it is to attract faculty and in
NYC we also have to deal with real estate issues. At Hunter, we can&amp;#39;t
just plop down a new building for CS even if we did have the money. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This of course is not just a capacity issue but also a diversity and
equity one and too many players are rearranging the deck chairs on the
Titanic. Some tech players are making an honest effort to deal with
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usv.com/blog/our-first-network-wide-diversity-inclusion-survey&#34;&gt;diversity&lt;/a&gt; and equity in a meaningful way, too many aren&amp;#39;t. I was
recently speaking with a friend at a big tech company. I was pitching
him on supporting what I&amp;#39;m building at Hunter. He said he really
wanted to help but his companies diversity plan, once you stripped
away the shiny paint was poaching from FANG (or is it FAAMG)
companies. The other thing I see is recruiting exclusively at &amp;#34;elite&amp;#34;
private schools and trying to grab as many &amp;#34;underserved&amp;#34; candidates as
possible. A third strategy involves counting everyone on your team for
diversity counts even if many of them aren&amp;#39;t really tech. Of course
the elite colleges play the same game. When you&amp;#39;ve got an incoming
class of let&amp;#39;s say 2000 and you&amp;#39;ve got 10 times that many applicants
with 4.0 GPAs and perfect test scores you can shape your class however
you want but it&amp;#39;s a zero sum game and doesn&amp;#39;t provide opportunity for
the masses.. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we want to solve these issues we have to deal with K12 and if
that&amp;#39;s the case it&amp;#39;s going to take at least 6 years maybe considerably
more before we really see results and that&amp;#39;s assuming we fix the
college capacity issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This brings me to CS for all. I&amp;#39;m a big believer in CS for All and
I&amp;#39;ve dedicated a lot of time and energy on bringing quality CS
education to the have nots but CS for All might not be the
answer. First, many of us believe that it&amp;#39;s not about turning everyone
into a software engineer. True, by exposing everyone to CS we&amp;#39;ll get a
larger pool working towards that end but the intent isn&amp;#39;t or at least
shouldn&amp;#39;t be as a feeder into the tech industry. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A bigger problem is ensuring that we indeed have quality CS for All
for all and that&amp;#39;s a real concern. Looking over the landscape here&amp;#39;s
what I&amp;#39;m seeing. Rich, well heeled schools are finding those few
really knowledgeable CS teachers and many of the poor schools are
getting quick and dirty training on some generic APCS-Principals
class. Dedicated hard working teachers who want to do a great job but
aren&amp;#39;t being given the time and resources to really learn CS and CS
pedagogy.  Now APCS-P can be a strong class or a weak one but in many
cases by going for the quick fix with a scripted class and then saying
&amp;#34;we&amp;#39;re done&amp;#34; is condemning those kids to sub standard CS. Even if
some do take CS1 in college my guess many will be underprepared and
many will drop. Even with a good APCS-P, the fact that no one is
paying attention to the complete pipeline and the transition from High
School to College and through the major will mean that we&amp;#39;re going to
lose many of the kids along the way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The answer? Good pre-service programs will help - that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m so
bullish on the program we&amp;#39;re developing at Hunter. A bad preservice
program, however - one that is based on &amp;#34;you take it you teach it&amp;#34;
won&amp;#39;t prepare our teachers to prepare our kids. Even then, we&amp;#39;re not
going to really solve the problem until we deal with little things
like, oh, you know, poverty. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I might sound pessimistic. Maybe I am but it doesn&amp;#39;t change
anything. I&amp;#39;m going to do my best to affect positive change in
whatever circles I can be they large or small and many others are
doing the same.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All those jobs that aren&amp;#39;t coming to NY?  They&amp;#39;d have been filled
before any sensible fix to our NYC Tech pipeline problem yields fruit
anyway and would likely have displaced the current fringe population
rather than uplift them.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>No Amazon HQ2 in NYC</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/no-amazon-hq/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2019 17:57:32 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/no-amazon-hq/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
That was the big tech news today. I know there was a good deal of
vocal outrage about the deal but to be honest I was pretty surprised
by the news. Normally deals like these get steamrolled through for
better or worse.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have decidedly mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, I have no
problem with Amazon - I&amp;#39;ve got a bunch of former students working
there. Mostly in Seattle but at least one in NYC. On the other hand
there were a lot of things about the deal, none of them having to do
specifically with Amazon as a company that made me very uneasy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s go through these issues from minor to major.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, I&amp;#39;m against special corporate incentives. In one ear I keep
hearing that these were generic incentives are available to any
company but in the other ear I keep hearing about special concessions
for Amazon. I keep thinking about stadium and Olympic deals. Those are
generally driven by politicians and money men with huge egos and from
what I can tell they generally don&amp;#39;t end up helping the little guy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next we have backroom politics. Like so much in New York, it certainly
appeared that this was a back room Cuomo deal where the local
communities weren&amp;#39;t included in the process. It wreaks of Cuomo
Hubris and ego. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Third we have all the jobs. A recent poll indicated that residents
welcomed the fact that this deal would &amp;#34;create new jobs&amp;#34; but the truth
is that it would &amp;#34;create new jobs for outsiders who will come in and
replace you.&amp;#34; This isn&amp;#39;t a knock on Amazon but it&amp;#39;s probably the
truth. The history of hypergentrification is not one of uplifting the
poor into the middle class. It&amp;#39;s more like bring in the middle and
upper class from other communities and displace the poor. This would
likely be the case with this much demand for tech talent this quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The local colleges, specifically CUNY will not be able to up the flow
of tech graduates that quickly without a big infusion of resources and
that&amp;#39;s something that wasn&amp;#39;t included in the deal. It&amp;#39;s great that
Amazon is supporting HS CS but tech companies aren&amp;#39;t hiring kids out
of high school with a single introductory experience like
APCS-Principals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since New York will not be able to supply the software engineers on a
dime the companies are going to bring them in from elsewhere. I
remember talking to a tech executive a few years ago and he was
telling me that he was going to have to &amp;#34;hire X software engineers in
the next five years&amp;#34; and that while he &amp;#34;would love for them to be New
Yorkers&amp;#34; he&amp;#39;d hire them from wherever he could get them. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Poor and working class people aren&amp;#39;t all of a sudden going to be
getting these high paying jobs. Sure, some will get into programs like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pursuit.org/&#34;&gt;Pursuit&lt;/a&gt; and get entry level coder jobs and the colleges will continue
to produce what they&amp;#39;re producing now and ramp up capacity as they are
able but a lot of people  who were here during the bad times are just
going to be forced out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the day most of this won&amp;#39;t change a thing one way or the
other. LIC is already on the upswing and rents are going through the
roof. Companies will continue to need tech talent in NY and NY will
continue to scramble to try to fill the need. Amazon already has a
presence in NYC and if they want to avail themselves of the talent
that comes from and wants to move to NY they&amp;#39;ll continue to build
their footprint here even without HQ2.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For me the takeaway is that we have to be much more aware of all our
residents and it is our obligation as a society to work to uplift
those who haven&amp;#39;t had the same opportunities as others. That means
really looking hard at diversity, equity, and things like
gentrification. It means not just bringing in jobs without having a
plan and a path for those at the bottom of the economic ladder to
climb up into those jobs. It means working with the communities for
their and New York&amp;#39;s benefit and not making deals that sound good and
might be good for New York as a whole but get there by amputating the
parts that we just don&amp;#39;t want to deal with.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Early Ap Registration - it&#39;s, um, for the kids</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/early-ap-registration-for-the-kids/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Feb 2019 08:08:38 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/early-ap-registration-for-the-kids/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I stumbled upon a thread over in the APCS-A Facebook group the other
day. It seems that the College Board is making some changes in their
&lt;a href=&#34;https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/about-ap/news-changes/ap-2019&#34;&gt;registration timeline&lt;/a&gt;. In the past, students registered for the exam
sometime in March with the exams administered in May. The new changes
include requiring registration in November along with $40 late
registration and cancellation fees.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The College Board is, of course, spinning this as for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MCNEYCZWqw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;fbclid=IwAR04Uuj7vpHoYU_8jMjw00YpAPXp7gi3MDGdTKhzpUXv7mI0OILW01KyzvA%0A&#34;&gt;the student&amp;#39;s
benefit&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At least a portion of the teaching community thinks otherwise and has
in fact started &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.change.org/p/demand-the-college-board-not-mandate-fall-ap-exam-requirements-and-deadlines&#34;&gt;this petition&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To me this is just another money grab by the College Board - an
organization that already has way too much influence over high school
education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s take a look at what the College Board actually brings to the
table. They offer an exam. A single exam in each subject offered
that&amp;#39;s supposed to in 3 hours encapsulate an entire years&amp;#39;s worth of
learning and from that, colleges might give  a student placement or
credit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But you say &amp;#34;they offer so much more.&amp;#34; Do they?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teacher&amp;#39;s have to submit syllabi and the college board approves
them. They offer samples but so do text book authors and third party
organizations. In my case I rolled my own. The teacher also develops
the course. Does the College Board provide materials? I guess, but so
do those same groups that provide curricula. The college board
certainly doesn&amp;#39;t define the subject. Last I checked Calculus, was
pretty well defined way before the AP program. So was 
Chemistry, and most other subjects. Actually, due to their outsized
influence they do define the subset of the subject in some cases and
we should really be questioning this influence. Finally, the teacher does
the actual hard job of teaching the class. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m  just not seeing the value added. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;re already seeing schools require that students take the exam to be
in the class or provide &amp;#34;incentives&amp;#34; like a credit or grade bump for
taking the exam or even removing the AP designation from the
transcript if the student doesn&amp;#39;t take the exam. Doing any of these is
just plain wrong. By all means explain the advantages and
disadvantages of taking the exam but to essentially force a student to
fork over money and personal data to an outside independent agency is
just plain wrong. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But you say that students in many districts don&amp;#39;t have to pay. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is even more insidious.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now it&amp;#39;s the taxpayer on the hook and the College Board has
successfully created an everlasting cash pipeline from the public into
private coffers while providing questionable value.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you don&amp;#39;t agree with me and think that these requirements or
incentives  are fine ask yourself this: If you had a child in a class
and the teacher said &amp;#34;your child has to sit in a room with a friend of
mine for three hours, give them $100 and personal data and I will give
your child a higher grade&amp;#34; you&amp;#39;d be outraged. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Spending three hours taking an external exam has no bearing on what a
student did or didn&amp;#39;t do in the class so the grades, credits etc
should be the same whether or not the kid took the AP exam.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s get back to the early registration changes. Currently kids
register for the AP exam in March. By then students might know what
college they&amp;#39;re likely to go to. They&amp;#39;ll know if the AP exam is of any
use to them. In November they don&amp;#39;t. I frequently lost some high
scores on AP exams because I had top students who were accepted early
to schools that didn&amp;#39;t award credit. I also lost a couple of low
scores of students that for whatever reasons had no chance at getting
a 3 or higher so opted not to sit for the exam. I guess the College Board came up
with a good way to get money for those kids without providing value in
return.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then there are block scheduled schools or other situations where kids
don&amp;#39;t start the class until after the new November deadline.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, let&amp;#39;s talk a bit about the College Board&amp;#39;s claim that this is
all for the students. The video talks about students doing better if
they signed up earlier. I&amp;#39;m skeptical but even if it&amp;#39;s true, is &amp;#34;doing
better on the AP exam&amp;#34; the goal we have for our students. How about
learning our subject area or being inspired to continue on with it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the video, teachers talk about how the kids are more motivated and
focused because the exam. This is getting to sound a lot like the
inane focus on high stakes test where the test is the goal. Is the
motivation that &amp;#34;you paid the $100&amp;#34; so it&amp;#39;s wasted if you don&amp;#39;t do
well or &amp;#34;the school paid $100&amp;#34; so we&amp;#39;ll guilt you into studying more?
Sorry, as teachers we can do better.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;ll get some flak for writing this but I also suspect that
there are many teachers who agree with me that the College Board is
not looking out for students but rather themselves.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating a school for CS</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/creating-a-school/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/creating-a-school/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2018/09/do-we-really-need-cs-focused-high.html&#34;&gt;Do we really need CS focused high schools?&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s the question Alfred Thompson asked partly in reaction to my
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/that-time-bill-gates-visited-afse&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; talking about Bill Gates&amp;#39; visit to &lt;a href=&#34;http://afsenyc.org&#34;&gt;AFSE&lt;/a&gt;, a NYC public school
with a CS focus.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On both posts, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/reallymdp&#34;&gt;Michael Preston&lt;/a&gt; shared some important and good points about
AFSE as a starting point and gateway that helped lead to CS4All in NYC
and also specifically about AFSE.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In response to Alfred&amp;#39;s question I thought it was time I shared a bit
about what I was pushing for AFSE back when I was involved. I wasn&amp;#39;t
able to talk publicly about any of this at the time because I was
warned very sternly by one DOE person involved that I shouldn&amp;#39;t talk
to &amp;#34;outsiders&amp;#34; about my concerns or designs. In retrospect, since I
stopped getting replies to my emails and was apparently dropped from
email lists after they selected their founding principal, I probably
should have been more public about my critiques. On the other hand, I
should have been more politic internally prior to getting to that
point.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Reading Alfred&amp;#39;s post, what I was pushing for AFSE at the time cuts
right to Alfred&amp;#39;s question so I thought I&amp;#39;d write about it today.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before starting though I want to be &lt;strong&gt;absolutely clear&lt;/strong&gt; about one
thing. This is not a critique of AFSE as it stands. There are some
great teachers and wonderful students there and I do what I can to
support both whenever I can. This is a post about my design vs the
DOE&amp;#39;s design and later implementation. Also note that the numbers,
sizes, restrictions and designs are all based on NY state and NYC
requirements along with what one can typically do in a NYC public
school.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even though it&amp;#39;s the least important issue with respect to a CS school
or not, let&amp;#39;s start by getting the dirty word out of the way. Given
the stated mission of the school (at the time) I wanted a screen. Not
a &amp;#34;Stuy test&amp;#34; screen but something. Probably something more along the
lines of the screen used by the Manhattan Science Hunter High
School. We never got that far in discussing it. My contention was and
still is that if you want to produce &amp;#34;Google ready&amp;#34; software engineers
by high school graduation, particularly in a small school, you can&amp;#39;t
start with kids 2 or 3 years behind in math. Now, if your goal isn&amp;#39;t
&amp;#34;Google ready engineers&amp;#34; but rather to use CS to engage a population
that isn&amp;#39;t otherwise engaged, I can get behind that and you don&amp;#39;t need
a screen. It&amp;#39;s important however to note it&amp;#39;s a different mission.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The DOE would maintain that you don&amp;#39;t need any screen and kids can
start out years behind and by the end of their senior year they&amp;#39;d be
years ahead. It doesn&amp;#39;t work that way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They&amp;#39;d ask tech people at meetings what they looked for in employees
knowing that they&amp;#39;d get back &amp;#34;teamwork, creativity etc.&amp;#34; I would of
course follow up with &amp;#34;where do you look for these candidates&amp;#34; and
they&amp;#39;d say &amp;#34;MIT, Cal Tech, Harvard.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The DOE insisted on no screen. This is fine but it&amp;#39;s no surprise that
Google&amp;#39;s not beating down the doors for AFSE graduates right out of
high school and the math regents show that you indeed can&amp;#39;t take kids
from multiple years behind and end up with them multiple years ahead
given typical school resources. They&amp;#39;re doing really good work there
but there&amp;#39;s no such thing as a miracle school just hard work and
incremental progress. I have heard more than once that the founding
principal had lobbied for a screen so I feel my original assessment
was correct.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next up, size. The DOE insisted on a small school focused on CS. They
wanted a school of around 136 kids per grade, which makes for 4
&amp;#34;homerooms,&amp;#34; and that the school would focus on CS. My proposal was
very different. I advocated for a school with about 340 kids per grade
and not specifically focused on CS but rather with a great model CS
program - a Software Engineering Institute at the blah blah school if
you would.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A small school can&amp;#39;t support a wide range of classes. With 4 classes
of kids per grade you don&amp;#39;t have a lot of schedule flexibility in
terms of class levels or electives. You also have very few teachers
per subject - for a subject taught for a full year every year for a
single period, you&amp;#39;d have one teacher per grade in that subject. If
you&amp;#39;re a school for CS you&amp;#39;re not going to be able to offer a robust
schedule of music or arts classes. Likewise an arts school is going to
be hard pressed to offer a suite of science electives. Remember,
public schools are not flush with money and can&amp;#39;t just offer loads of
courses for a handful of kids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What we end up with is a school with limited offerings beyond CS and
we&amp;#39;re asking kids to decide in 8th grade if that&amp;#39;s the career path for
them. This is a hidden problem of all small schools. Kids shouldn&amp;#39;t
have to decide on their future in the 8th grade. They should all be
able to go to schools that offer a wide range of subjects to a good
degree of depth. Only large public schools can do this. I know that
public schools come with their own problems but this is one of the
trade offs. I believe that having this selection done in 8th grade
along with the tech stereotypes and preconceptions is a big part of
the schools difficulty in appealing to girls.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now even if every student who applied and is randomly accepted into
AFSE does indeed want to be a CS person then we&amp;#39;ve also lost because
we&amp;#39;ve done nothing to get more kids into the pool. It could still
potentially function as a model school in terms of courses or possibly
pedagogy but it won&amp;#39;t expose and inspire anyone new with respect to
tech.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s contrast that with what I proposed. I wanted around 340 kids per
grade or 10 &amp;#34;homerooms.&amp;#34; How did I arrive at that number? It wasn&amp;#39;t
just a guess. Schools like Stuyvesant or Brooklyn Tech are clearly too
large and impersonal but small 136 kids per grade schools are too
small. The 10 homeroom per grade school seems to be the best
compromise. There are enough teachers so that there&amp;#39;s institutional
memory when one leaves, enough of them and students for a varied set
of electives. It also means that there are enough teachers to avoid
bad fits between teacher and student. At the same time, it&amp;#39;s not so
large that kids get lost. I also spoke with some of the best
programmers I know - not computer programmers but people who schedule
students for classes in schools and this seems to be the best
compromise size range. Also, with this size you don&amp;#39;t necessarily need
a screen if you want &amp;#34;Google ready&amp;#34; software engineers. There will be
enough of a range kids that come in behind and kids that come in ahead
can get what they need.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also didn&amp;#39;t want it to be a CS school but rather a school with great
CS. That way it would appeal to a range of students. Kids who think
they want to do CS and those who don&amp;#39;t. At the end of they day some of
the kids that think they wanted CS won&amp;#39;t want it and those kids will
have other options. At the same time some of the non-tech kids will
take the required CS and find out that &amp;#34;this is neat stuff&amp;#34; and we get
to increase the number of people in the tent.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I still believe my design would have worked out better but that&amp;#39;s not
to say that I don&amp;#39;t think that AFSE has been and is important. As Mike
pointed out in his comment, AFSE was the first unscreened school to
offer legit and it did (and does) offer a place for CS kids that don&amp;#39;t
get into or don&amp;#39;t want to go to a place like Stuy which is very much a
large school and an unforgiving machine. It was also a showpiece that
helped pave the way for CS in all NYC schools. All of that&amp;#39;s good.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I do regret parts of what went down between me and DOE. I don&amp;#39;t regret
sticking to my beliefs in terms of school design but I would like to
have been able to handle the politics of the situation better. Had I
remained involved I think I had more to offer. I don&amp;#39;t regret it too
much – at the time it went from the DOE telling me one week to &amp;#34;you
can have any role in the school you want&amp;#34; to the next week &amp;#34;we want to
introduce you to the person who we&amp;#39;re making principal&amp;#34; and I
recognize that I&amp;#39;d have a hard time putting that aside now and the me
of a decade ago would have found it impossible. That said, I think
everyone would have been better off if both sides could have played
things better.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;d still love to have the chance someday to set up and run a school
of my design with my team. It&amp;#39;ll probably never happen but it would be
nice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Giving control of NYC&#39;s specialized schools to a political appointee</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/shsat-part2/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/shsat-part2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday I shared my thoughts on Bill de Blasio&amp;#39;s plans to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; the
selection criteria for New York City&amp;#39;s specialized high schools. If
you haven&amp;#39;t read the post, you can find it &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/shsat/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was going to get back to CS and CS Ed related blogging today but
there&amp;#39;s more to the story.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In spite of what BdB stated, it&amp;#39;s not enough for him to switch to another
measure - the middle school state exam along with some modifiers. This
is about ending the exam altogether and not replacing it with anything
better. Here&amp;#39;s a link to information on the proposed legislation for
&lt;a href=&#34;https://legiscan.com/NY/bill/A10427/2017&#34;&gt;New York Assembly Bill 10427&lt;/a&gt; including links to the actual text.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s a lot of beurobabble but the end game is to basically allow
the chancellor (not sure if this means city or state) to do whatever
they want.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here are some of the key points:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Seats would ultimately go to the top 5 to 7 percent of each middle school&amp;#39;s
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
class.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These students would have to also be classified in the top 25% city wide.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Top is defined by a composite score of multiple measures as
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
determined by the chancellor which means anything goes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Remaining seats will be filled by
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
lottery of all students with a 3.7 GPA or greater.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s not clear how the students would be allocated to each of the
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
specialized schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what does this all mean?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Multiple measures could mean the state test + average. It could mean
average + recommendation. It could be shoe size + favorite color. The
chancellor also decides how to weight these multiple measures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This means that the politicians can do whatever they want to paint any
picture they want regardless of how their ideological and political
games hurt kids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Any teacher, in fact, any rational adult  will tell you that middle
schools are not interchangeable. The top students at one middle school
are typically not at the same level as top students at another
one. I&amp;#39;m sure you can cluster middle schools in terms of the students
they graduate, what the students know and can do and the clusters will
likely fall on economic lines. This is the problem that BdB should be
addressing not how to rig the specialized school admissions stats.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if this is done right, you&amp;#39;re assuming an even distribution of
top gifted students across all the middle schools. If one school has
higher concentration of gifted students, they&amp;#39;re out of luck. The end
result is that if you attend an SP or other gifted program for eighth
grade you&amp;#39;ll likely be locked out of the specialized schools. What if
a particular middle school is attractive to all of our top math team
talent? Only a couple will get in to the specialized schools under the
new system since each school is allocated a fixed number of slots.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I guess this does make sense if you don&amp;#39;t believe in gifted students
or gifted education but then why not just get rid of the specialized
schools to begin with rather than playing these games. This &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34;
will result in parents having to decide - do I send my kids to the
gifted middle school program and hurt their chances to get into a
specialized high school or do I try to find the lowest performing
school I can find and have my kid stand out. This is pretty messed up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the day, though, you have to remember that any change to
the process can help one group and hurt another. Stuy, for example has
46% of it&amp;#39;s students on free or reduced lunch and is about 70%
Asian. If in the new system you&amp;#39;re increasing the percent population
of an under represented group, you&amp;#39;re likely reducing the percentage
of Asian students. So, you&amp;#39;re creating opportunities for a number of as of yet
undetermined students (who might not be properly prepared for the
experience) at the expense of economically disadvantaged Asian
students who have proven to be prepared for the experience. Wouldn&amp;#39;t
a better solution be to fix the opportunities presented at the middle
schools rather than rig the system of high school acceptance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Going further, a response on another blog noted that BdB probably
refused to do anything with the admissions criteria of the non big
three because they all had numbers that he would consider more
diverse. The commenter provided the Black / Latino percentages, I added the
free and reduced lunch numbers:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border-spacing=&#34;10px&#34; frame=&#34;border&#34;&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;School&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Percent Black / Latino&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Free / Reduced Lunch&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Brooklyn Latin&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;28%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;61%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;HSMSE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;26%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;46%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;HSAS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;25%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Queens Sci&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;64%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All the more reason to run some tests or analysis there. Of course, if
you look further you&amp;#39;ll note that HSAS only has 25% of its students on
free or reduced lunch so is it really doing better than Stuy or Sci
with ~45% low income students  each  or Brooklyn Tech which supports
62% or are we to say that there&amp;#39;s low income and then there&amp;#39;s the
right low income?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Certainly the education system needs work but the proposed legislation
is not a solution. It&amp;#39;s taking a flawed but objective measure and
replacing it with essentially chancellor&amp;#39;s discretion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the legislation passes, by the year 2022 we will have admissions to
what used to be some of the nations finest high schools determined by
a political appointee rather than an objective test.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s a shame. It was very important to my wife and me to have our kids
go to public schools and I was very happy to have been able to
navigate the system with them from first grade through high school
graduation with only a few bumps along the way. With this nonsense
from the political left and the privatization push from the political
right (or actually both sides) pretty soon there will be nothing left.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Changing Admissions to the NYC Specialized High Schools</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/shsat/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/shsat/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, Bill de Blasio, the current Mayor of New York City outlined
how he would &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; our specialized schools. The schools he was
referring to were the &amp;#34;big three&amp;#34; of Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, and
Brooklyn Tech and then five additional schools - The High School  for
Math Science and Engineering at CCNY, The High School for American
Studies at Lehman, Brooklyn Latin, The Queens Arts and Science High
School at
York College, and Staten Island Tech.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All use a single SAT style test, the SHSAT, for admission. The Big Three are
locked into that system unless there are changes made by the state
legislature. The Mayor can make changes to the admissions criteria of
the other five on his own.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problem, as stated by Chalkbeat writers Alex Zimmerman and  Monica
Disare is that:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The city’s specialized high schools — considered some of the crown
jewels of New York City’s education system — accept students based on
a single test score. Over the last decade, they have come under fire
for offering admissions to few students of color: While two-thirds of
city students are black or Hispanic, only about 10 percent of
admissions offers to those schools go to black or Hispanic students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I normally don&amp;#39;t write about things like this but given my history at
and with Stuyvesant I thought I should.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before getting started, my biases - I believe in public schools, not
charters, I also believe that a system should have gifted programs and
magnet schools and also a mix of large comprehensive schools and
smaller niche ones. Additionally, while I do believe in gifted
programs I&amp;#39;m not sure at what point it makes sense to start offering
them. When we were looking at elementary schools for our own kids we
opted for a neighborhood public school rather than applying to the
district gifted program as we felt it offered a better overall
education. On the other hand, had our kids not made Stuyvesant, I&amp;#39;m
not sure what we would have done. Part of that was due to the fact
that the Bloomberg administration destroyed just about all the large
comprehensive schools so, other than that large test schools and
LaGuardia, good luck finding a school that was strong in the
humanities, sciences and offered a robust music program.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
The overall picture
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For reference, here are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theschoolboards.com/showthread.php/4324-Specialized-High-School-SHSAT-Cutoff-Scores-for-2018&#34;&gt;unofficial cutoff scores&lt;/a&gt; for the specialized
schools from 2018 along with the NY State data on free and reduced
lunch for 2017. Note that there&amp;#39;s overlap between the schools. I
separated out SI Tech since geography probably affects it&amp;#39;s numbers
more than the other schools and I separated the big three from the
remaining four because I think the three are all substantially larger. The
free and reduced lunch percent is important because I believe an
entire school qualifies for Title I funding if the number&amp;#39;s
over 40 so while these schools are not populated entirely by low
income students, all but HSAS has a substantial number and there&amp;#39;s a
chance, some say a good one that at best BdB&amp;#39;s plans will merely
shuffle which low income kids get in rather than actually solving the
root problem.

&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
The plan
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
Part 1 - test prep
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s idea here is that test prep is rampant for SHSAT and that the
test can be gamed. This may or may not be true but if it is then it&amp;#39;s
safe to assume that a lot of low income kids are doing test
prep either by prioritizing test prep programs in family budgets,
working off of an SHSAT test prep book or by attending a middle school
that has some form of prep.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There has long been a program on the books called &amp;#34;The Discovery
Program&amp;#34; which has a free city run test prep component and also a
summer component. The summer component is for low income students who
score within &amp;#34;a few points&amp;#34; of the school in question&amp;#39;s cutoff
score. At the end of the summer, I believe the students retest and in
general make the school in question.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This program is a good thing and should be reinstated&lt;/strong&gt; but I don&amp;#39;t
know if it will result in the changes that BdB is looking for. More
likely Stuy will get its discovery kids from Science and Science from
Tech. As there are already many low income students at all of the
schools there&amp;#39;s no indication that this would increase the number of
under represented groups which is BdB&amp;#39;s goal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s also worth noting that there&amp;#39;s a sizable chunk of Brooklyn Tech
students that don&amp;#39;t perform particularly well on regents exams.
Everyone knows I&amp;#39;m not a fan of standardized tests and I don&amp;#39;t
believe that students that score a &amp;#34;few points&amp;#34; lower on the SHSAT are
any less qualified to be in a specialized school but at the lowest
performing end of these schools, one has to ask how specialized is it
really?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
Part 2 - use state test scores instead of the SHSAT
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This &lt;strong&gt;could be&lt;/strong&gt; a &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; good thing with one major caveat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Twenty one middle schools produce over half the students that
ultimately are accepted to the specialized schools. For the rest,
there are a few reasons
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many students don&amp;#39;t take the SHSAT.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There have been stories of schools steering kids away from the
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
specialized schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s no culture in those schools of striving for specialized
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
school acceptance or attendance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The academic programs at those schools don&amp;#39;t prepare students for
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
the SHSAT exam for reasons that we&amp;#39;re not going to delve into here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All students already take the NY State middle school Math and English
exams. Yes, it would further raise the stakes for those exams but it
would ensure that the specialized schools are on the map for everyone,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The big question here is &amp;#34;do the current state exams cover enough
material in enough depth to select and differentiate for gifted
programs.&amp;#34; I don&amp;#39;t know the answer to this question. If they don&amp;#39;t
then using state test scores will be a disaster. If they do, then they
could be a suitable alternative.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-5&#34;&gt;
Part 3 - admissions from every middle school
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is the third part of BdB&amp;#39;s proposal - guarantee admissions to the
top 10% of students at every middle school.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This could be a real disaster either for the students or for the
schools. There&amp;#39;s no question that students coming out of different
middle schools are at different levels of preparedness for the
specialized schools. Arguably the most obvious difference is that some
middle schools offer algebra and others don&amp;#39;t.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For better or worse, the specialized school&amp;#39;s curricula, classes, and
overall programs have evolved hand in hand with the exam. If you all
of a sudden end up placing a large number of students with a
different and arguable weaker academic profile into these schools one
of two things will happen. Either the students will struggle immensely
or the school will have to lower its standards. There&amp;#39;s no two ways
about it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you set standards for academic preparedness for the specialized
schools either by making a hard cutoff on an exam score be it state or
SHSAT and then spread those acceptances across all the schools maybe
it could work. If not, you&amp;#39;re setting up students with high grades at
schools with weak programs up for failure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another problem is what to do with non-public school students -
private schools, charters which take public money but act as private
schools, parochial, and home school students. Where do they fall in to
this equation?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-6&#34;&gt;
Is one measure bad?
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So there you have my thoughts on BdB&amp;#39;s specific proposals but I also
want to address his contention that a single measure is bad and makes
the comparison to colleges where they by and large use multiple
measures. This is a ridiculous comparison. Yes, colleges look at
multiple measures but after watching decades of Stuy students go off
to college, it&amp;#39;s clear to me that the process is by no means fair or
consistent. Elite schools can easily game their acceptances and
they still can have 100% of their applicants with off the charts SAT
scores.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A single test might not be ideal but it can only be gamed by test prep
and test prep can be as cheap as buying a test prep book.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As to other measures that come up from time to time - interviews,
portfolios, essays - who does that help? The low income kid or the
well to do one?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re going to add another measure for admission it has to be
something that can&amp;#39;t be gamed or politically influenced,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-7&#34;&gt;
Alternatives
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Should the city address the fact that there are groups that are under
represented at the specialized schools? Certainly, or rather, the city
should address deficiencies in opportunities that are like the causes
of this under representation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Should the city be doing things differently? Also yes. Here are some
thoughts on what the city can and should be doing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-8&#34;&gt;
Do the experiments in the non-big three.
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are five specialized schools that aren&amp;#39;t covered by state
legislation. Why not run your experiments there. You&amp;#39;ve got  the big
three as a control group and what&amp;#39;s more if you look at the
&amp;#34;acceptance score windows&amp;#34; in the table above, you&amp;#39;ll see that there&amp;#39;s
enough overlap that you can probably get some real data out of these
experiments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why not change the admissions criteria for one or two of them and see
how it goes before jumping in whole hog. Figure out if anything works first.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-9&#34;&gt;
Check existing data
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;ve got SHSAT results and State Test score results along with
student grades for years. Why not study correlations between
them. Rather than making a specious claim about middle school grades
in NYC Public Schools vs state tests vs the SHSAT, run the
numbers. Take a look at student high school performance based on these
predictions. This shouldn&amp;#39;t be guess work and city should have the
data to do better.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-10&#34;&gt;
Fix the middle schools
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This one is more pie in the sky because no politician really wants to
take this one but you&amp;#39;ve got to look at what&amp;#39;s going on in the middle
schools and why.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tweeted this the other day:
&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;would love to see this experiment - take the entire staff / faculty / admin of one of the 20 or so middle schools that are the primary feeders to the spec schls and swap them with another middle school and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/1003074760786501632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;June 3, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The truth is that if you did this, the high performing school would
probably continue to be high performing and the low performing one
would still struggle. There&amp;#39;s only so much a teacher can do. A school
with a disadvantaged population needs the resources to succeed - lower
class sizes for a start. Add wraparound services, extensive after
school and weekend opportunities - make the schools a part of the
community and maybe we can get somewhere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another question relating to our schools in general is to look at
attrition rates to private schools - how many students in our under
represented groups are being siphoned off to private schools on
scholarship. I don&amp;#39;t have any data for this. It could be an
insignificant amount or it could go a long way in explaining the
downturn in the numbers over the decades.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-11&#34;&gt;
So where are we
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are a lot of changes I&amp;#39;d love to see in our public schools and I
do believe BdB&amp;#39;s heart is in the right place. I&amp;#39;m concerned that some
of the solutions that he and other politicians come up with will hurt
the current low income students at the specialized schools and
unintentionally advantage the well to do while not helping those that
at least BdB may honestly want to help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He should enact Discovery and research the State Tests but proceed
with caution. The test schools have always been and continue to be a
gateway for poor and immigrant students and any changes that are
proposed should be weighed carefully and &lt;strong&gt;tested&lt;/strong&gt; before taking steps
that could real harm when good is intended.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Should CS for All be implemented at the college level?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/csforall-in-college/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/csforall-in-college/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s been a lively discussion on pushback to CS for All at the K12
level over on Facebook. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/guzdial&#34;&gt;Mark Guzdial&lt;/a&gt; started a sub thread asking if CS
for All should first be implemented at the undergrad level rather than K12.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s an interesting question and as good as anything to get me out of
my month long non-blogging rut.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mark was right when he said that if Colleges implement CS for All, K12 will
likely do so to follow - just look at AP. Colleges have been saying
that students should take more AP classes (while giving less credit)
and we all know where that&amp;#39;s led.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, can colleges really do CS for All, what does it
mean and what would it look like.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Much like there is no single K12 - it&amp;#39;s 50 states and who knows how
many independent school districts, there won&amp;#39;t be a single CS for All
at the college level but let&amp;#39;s think about how things could play out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many colleges have distribution requirements. Students must take one
course from bucket A, two from bucket B etc. Many schools that I&amp;#39;ve
looked at already  count CS courses in one of their distribution
buckets. This doesn&amp;#39;t mean every student will take CS but in theory
means they can. Colleges could in theory create a required CS bucket
or even a required CS course but I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s as easy as
that. It might be at a private institution but while I don&amp;#39;t know all
the ins and outs of Hunter&amp;#39;s governance rules I do know that adding a
universal student requirement is a HUGE undertaking.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So my take is that while it might be easy for a private college
to add a CS requirement I&amp;#39;m guessing other public institutions are
more similar to Hunter and it&amp;#39;s not going to be an easy task.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regardless, let&amp;#39;s say we have a required class on the books. Will we
have the capacity to teach it? It seems that schools are struggling to deal
with their existing CS majors and running sufficient electives and
courses for them. Just a month or so ago there was an article about a
college ending its CS minor due to lack of resources. It doesn&amp;#39;t sound
like a radically different problem then that faced in K12. Maybe it&amp;#39;s
harder given that at least in NY, there is &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/room-for-csforall&#34;&gt;room for a required CS
course&lt;/a&gt; if you can find the teacher.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even so, assuming we have the capacity to enroll every undergrad in a
CS course what would that be? I think most people would be in
agreement that it shouldn&amp;#39;t be CS 101. Maybe existing pre-major
courses but even there I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s always the best
path. There could be a great pre-major course to give students the
basics and lead some into the major but what about a CS course for
students in majors that need some deeper but focussed programming
skills. The appropriate course for them isn&amp;#39;t the same as a
general/pre-major course. Using Statistics as an example, at Hunter,
many majors require a statistics course which is off loaded to the
Stats department. Each major has slightly different requirements. Over
years, the end result is a course that it seems that nobody is happy
with - a least common denominator course. CS for All at the college level
could give us a least common denominator course that doesn&amp;#39;t serve
anyone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, if you have the resources, none of these are issues. A well
heeled private institution can run tons of sections of specialized
classes no problem but this means just like on the K12 level we&amp;#39;ll
get the CS for All tale of two cities that I see coming in NY where
the rich schools have good programs and the poor get a substandard
experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With all of this said, I&amp;#39;m finally getting to the big red flag with
college CS for All and it&amp;#39;s an issue that everyone conveniently
ignores. I&amp;#39;m talking about teacher quality. One of my big takeaways
from SIGCSE is that college faculty are well behind K12 teachers in
terms of pedagogy and I don&amp;#39;t see this changing anytime soon. This is
to be expected given that professor&amp;#39;s career advancement is really
based on research. Having a good teacher is always important but it&amp;#39;s
even more important for non-major students since a student in the
professor&amp;#39;s major will at least be passionate about the subject
area. To me, this is not a recipe for success.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One can certainly make the claim that we aren&amp;#39;t any better off right
now at the K12 level because we don&amp;#39;t have teachers who know either
the subject nor how to teach it and at least at the college level they
know the subject matter. This is very true and it&amp;#39;s why pre-service CS
teacher preparation is so critical to getting this right even though
it will take time. That&amp;#39;s something that both Mark and I have been
vocal about but more on that subject next time.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is there room for CS for All</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/room-for-csforall/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/room-for-csforall/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
A fear revolving around CS For All concerns where will the money
come from and how will we fit in the new classes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One suggested solution is to integrate CS into other subjects. I
thought I&amp;#39;d write today about why I don&amp;#39;t think the fear is valid and
while integrating CS into other classes can have value, it probably
isn&amp;#39;t a long term solution for CS education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s start with the integration solution. The idea is to bring CS
into an existing class. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bootstrapworld.org/&#34;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;, a program I&amp;#39;ve written about before
and one of the programs I like does this, primarily in Algebra. The
idea is that this supports the student&amp;#39;s learning Algebra while
exposing them to CS. It&amp;#39;s a nice program but a math teacher using
Bootstrap shouldn&amp;#39;t be confused with a computer science
teacher. They&amp;#39;re bringing some CS to their student and engaging the
students in a different way mathematically and that&amp;#39;s all great but in
general you can&amp;#39;t take two classes worth of material and concepts and
fit them into one class and the number of teachers who are truly
knowledgable in any two academic subject areas both in content and
pedagogical content knowledge is few. I&amp;#39;m guessing that one of the
reasons that Bootstrap works in Algebra is the alignment of the
toolset and Algebra and how you can teach it. The other is that
Algebra is frequently given more time for fewer topics. In some
struggling schools, students might have two years of algebra or a
double period so there&amp;#39;s time to add in some CS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m all for cross curricular work. You can look at applications of
science in math classes, do mathy work in a CS class, run stats and
data analysis in math and CS classes on materials from History classes
and all of this is great. You can even create great combined curricula
where you do indeed teach multiple subjects in an integrated way but
to think that you can take what is typically taught in two different
classes and you can combine both so that they&amp;#39;re taught in one class
with one teacher sounds fishy to me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, at the end of the day, if you go the integration approach you&amp;#39;re
either going to have to dedicate a similar set of resources both in
time and personel to having independent courses. The alternative is
that CS will be the second class subject.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, let&amp;#39;s look at actually bringing in CS For All as a separate
course.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here are the New York State Graduation Requirements [fn::The state
lists by credits which are a year, I doubled the numbers to map to semesters]:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Subject&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;Number of semesters&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;English&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Soc Studies&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Science&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Math&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LOTE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Arts&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Phys Ed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Health&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Electives&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Total&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;44&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It can be difficult to fit Phys Ed in since it has to be offered every
semester so let&amp;#39;s double the Phys Ed requirement to 8 semesters. What
is actually normally done is to have 7.5 periods of science a week and
2.5 periods of Gym.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This means that the basic student program uses 48 class slots and
includes 7 elective slots.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In terms of exit exams, students have to pass the following Regents:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
English
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Any single math (Algebra, Geometery, Alg 2 / Trig)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Any single Social Studies (US History or Global History
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Any single Science (Living Env (bio), Chem, Phys, Earth Science)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Any additional Regents exam
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The requirement of passing a single Math regents is what leads to the
extra time allocated to Algebra that I mentioned when discussing
integrating CS into Algebra above.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To get an Advanced Regents diploma you have to pass additional exams -
both history, all three math, three science and maybe more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using a Typical 7 period plus lunch day, we have room for 56 single
semeter classes in a high school career. This means that assuming
students aren&amp;#39;t failing too many classes, even with the extra Phys Ed
allocation I mentioned above  we can easily fit computer
science into our day. In fact, we can technically fit in four full
years assuming a student doesn&amp;#39;t have to repeat any class.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So in New York state we certainly have the time but what about the
budget? That&amp;#39;s not an issue either. The state also requires that
students recieve 5.5 hours of instruction a day exclusive of
lunch. At 47 minute periods, that translates to students being
assigned 7 instructional classes a day which means we can&amp;#39;t just give
the kids the required 44. We have to fill all 56 available class slots
over those four years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course it&amp;#39;s not really that simple. Students fail classes and have
to repeat them and some classes might be assigned more time than
others but it looks to me like we should be able to fit
computer science in without any big budgetary or scheduling
changes. The challenge will be finding the teacher and working the
internal politics and policies since as computer science comes in it
will mean removing some electives even if those electives are additional years
of science, math, or English.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Programs like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tealsk12.org/&#34;&gt;TEALS&lt;/a&gt; and Bootstrap are important transitional programs
and even when we do have qualified CS teachers they will play an
important role - TEALS in providing industry support and resources and
Bootstrap by integrating curricular areas and over time as preservice
programs start to appear the rest will work itself out.
&lt;/p&gt;

This morning, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/guzdial&#34;&gt;Mark Guzdial&lt;/a&gt; wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://computinged.wordpress.com/2018/04/27/lack-of-funding-leads-to-lack-of-teachers-leads-to-lack-of-cs-classes-we-may-need-to-change-our-strategy/&#34;&gt;unfunded mandates and CS for
All&lt;/a&gt;. Unfunded mandates frequently wreak havoc on schools in a number
of ways but in the long run, I don&amp;#39;t think it should have a severe
effect on CS for All. Rather, it could have a big impact on the number
of CS courses we offer beyond that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mark relay&amp;#39;s a story from the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School where
at the time many students wanted more CS classes but the school wasn&amp;#39;t
planning on hiring a new CS teacher. The money quote is:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over 50 percent of students signing up for Level 2 [computer science] courses next year identify as African Americans,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No, I&amp;#39;m not talking about the diversity issue raised by the quote, I&amp;#39;m
talking about &lt;strong&gt;Level 2 [computer science]&lt;/strong&gt;. This implies that the
students already had &lt;strong&gt;Level 1 computer science&lt;/strong&gt;. Level 1 would cover
CS For All so now we&amp;#39;re talking about CS electives vs other
electives. This is something I had to deal with for most of my career
even after we got a CS requirement at Stuy. It was always a battle to
hire enough CS teachers to meet demand. The hard part was politics -
there were always older more entrenched subject areas who would rather
force kids into their electives rather than allow them to take my CS
electives. This is a whole other kettle of fish than CS for All. It&amp;#39;s
an issue for some schools now and will become a &lt;strong&gt;BIG&lt;/strong&gt; issue in five to
fifteen years when a single CS required course is more the norm. The
issue raised here is a new CS elective vs entrenched teachers and
classes which shuld lead to a discussion of the relative value of CS
electives vs other electives. That said, the reality is that it
usually comes down to school and local power and politics. Also to be
considered is the potential ebb and flow of interest - there might be
demand for 5 more CS classes and 5 less something else this year but
there might not be next year and then we&amp;#39;re in real trouble staffing
wise.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Schools, public high schools in particular are zero sum endeavors. You
have a fixed number of periods a day, specific class requirements, and
certain mandates as to a the minimum and maximum number of classes a
student can take. In New York City, I believe students are required to
have a &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; schedule which basically means they can&amp;#39;t come in for
English, Math, and History and then go home.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With CS for All, you&amp;#39;re basically allocating reallocating some amount
of time to computer science. It might be hard to find a qualified
teacher. particularly in a small school where the population won&amp;#39;t
support a full time CS teacher and it might ruffle the feathers of the
teachers that will be losing the time but it shouldn&amp;#39;t make much of a
dent or really any dent on the budget.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mark also raises the possibility of embedding CS into other subject
classes. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bootstrapworld.org/&#34;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; is a program that I&amp;#39;m rather fond of that does
just this in Algebra classes (although more recently they&amp;#39;re working
to branch out into other subject areas). Even though I&amp;#39;m a big
Bootstrap fan I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the answer to CS for All or CS in
the high schools in general. I think that one of the reasons why
Bootstrap works so well is the alignment between the CS tool they use
and the way Algebra is or can be taught. Another reason is the fact
that while Algebra is the lowest level of the traditional high school
classes, it&amp;#39;s frequently the one for which the most time is
allocated. Students in low performing schools might take Algebra over
two years or have a double period. This won&amp;#39;t be the case for other
subject areas. What this means is that there&amp;#39;s more likely extra time
to embed another subject, cs, into the Algebra class. Long term,
embedding CS into another subject area requires:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
a teacher that really knows both subjects
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
enough time so you can add all the cool CS content while still
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
preparing the students for both the next level of whatever subject
you&amp;#39;re embedded in  as well as for whatever standardized
assessments come at the end of the year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I said, I&amp;#39;m a Bootstrap fan but I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the answer for
CS in K12.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back to the original topic there are certainly issues with
implementing CS for All but I don&amp;#39;t think school funding is the
biggest hurdle. For me there are other big challenges. One is having a
supply of qualified teachers. In the long run as states outline CS
requirements and pre-service programs crop up this will work itself
out. Until then, yes, we will have an issue and yes it will take some
funding for stop gap and transitional teacher preperation. A second issue is
working the internal politics. Adding CS does mean removing something
else or more likely a piece of something else. The third one is what
I&amp;#39;m noticing in NY where CS for all seems to at times forget about
the CS. If we have knowledgeable teachers we can work around that one
but I still think that might be my biggest concern.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Strong K12 Teacher Certification is Important</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/strong-teacher-certification/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/strong-teacher-certification/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
About a week ago New York State&amp;#39;s new regulation creating a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20180327/NEWS/180329893/new-york-will-finally-have-certified-computer-science-teachers&#34;&gt;K12 CS
teacher certification&lt;/a&gt; went live. Just the other day I was honored to be
interviewed by  &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mflamm_reporter&#34;&gt;Matt Flamm&lt;/a&gt; of Crain&amp;#39;s New York in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20180410/TECHNOLOGY/180419999/asked-answered-teacher-changed-jobs-to-push-for-new-york-states-new&#34;&gt;follow up piece&lt;/a&gt;
about it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having K12 CS teacher certification is big and having quality programs
that lead to certification is &lt;strong&gt;HUGE&lt;/strong&gt;. In my view, it&amp;#39;s a game changer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s Focus on high school, my wheelhouse.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From a course offerings point of view it&amp;#39;s the wild west. I don&amp;#39;t mean
this as a bad thing, it&amp;#39;s just that there&amp;#39;s a huge range of offerings
from AP to home brew, physical computing, game based, cyber security,
you name it, there&amp;#39;s a curriculum. The long and short of this is that
schools need teachers to teach all of these experiences. Without a
strong certification pathway we&amp;#39;re going to be stuck with the current
training based model where teachers are trained to deliver canned
curricula rather than truly teach. With strong teacher preparation
programs teachers will be prepared not only to deliver all the
existing curricula but, arguable more importantly design their own
learning experiences appropriate for the populations they work with.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is important and alone would make having CS certification
worthwhile but to me the BIG win is that it creates a viable career
path.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
People say we&amp;#39;ll never find enough CS teachers because the tech
industry pays so well. I&amp;#39;ve never believed that. We find math teachers
even though many could flee to finance and chem teachers in spite of
big pharma&amp;#39;s call so why can&amp;#39;t we find CS teachers? Because we&amp;#39;ve
never provided a path into the profession and a viable career track.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Certification means that over time schools will be able to build CS
teachers and the discipline will be treated as the other
subjects. Prior to certification, a CS teacher might be cut if a
school&amp;#39;s math department downsized. With certification, the career
track for a CS teacher is the same as the track for any other teacher.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It also means that young people starting out who are interested in
both teaching and computer science will have a way of getting into the
profession - something that has never before existed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having CS certification alone won&amp;#39;t woo a
plethora of current tech professionals into teaching but over time,
we&amp;#39;ll start to have CS Ed majors or CS majors pursuing CS ED Masters
degrees and entering the profession. This won&amp;#39;t happen in a press or
election cycle but it will happen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This all hinges on quality prep programs. I think I&amp;#39;ve hit the sweet
spot with what I&amp;#39;ve designed at Hunter. The critical components are of
course content and pedagogy. Teacher candidates must have both
sufficient depth and breadth in the subject and all the pedagogical
content knowledge that comes along with it. I don&amp;#39;t agree with the
common approach of taking a course to teach a course - that is, having
courses like &amp;#34;APCS - Principles for teachers&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;APCS - A for
teachers.&amp;#34;  I want my teachers to be able to teach any reasonable
curriculum or design their own so we&amp;#39;ll be rolling out courses that
examine the commonly offerd curricula but prepare teachers for a whole
lot more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s been an exciting week in NY CS Ed and there&amp;#39;s a lot more to come.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fixing the Absent Teacher Reserve (ATR) situation</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/atrs/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/atrs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In the New York City department of education a recurring hot topic is
the Absent Teacher Reserve or ATR pool.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A teacher or administrator in the ATR pool is a licensed, most likely
tenured teacher not assigned permanently to a school. Each year these
educators get shuttled from school to school and denied a chance to
actually settle in a position.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The ATR pool was created under the Bloomberg administration. Prior to
that, when there was an opening school transfers were basically
seniority based and when school had too many teachers the least senior
was excessed or basically out of a job until a school with an opening
could be found. The Bloomberg plan allowed teachers to use criteria
other than seniority for transfers but so as not to violate the
contract agreed to by both parties, teachers who were excessed, as
they might not be least senior, were kept on as employees and put in
the pool.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
ATR&amp;#39;s would rotate from school to school. Sometimes for a couple of
week but more recently for a year at a time. When at a school for only
a couple of weeks they could only be used as subs or for grunt work
but even when there for a year they&amp;#39;re treated like second class
citizens.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The ATR pool grew in size when the Bloomberg/Klein DOE went on the war
path, set schools up to fail and closed them left and right. If you
had the bad luck being at a close out school when it closed then, hello
ATR pool.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over the years, the press, ed reformers and politicians have unfairly
bashed this group of educators. They&amp;#39;ve falsely claimed that these are
criminal teachers or unsatisfactory teachers. That&amp;#39;s a blatant
lie. Teachers up on charges are removed from schools and await a
hearing in another draconian process set up to violate teacher&amp;#39;s
rights. If a teacher is ultimately found guilty, they are disciplined
or fired. If exonerated, they&amp;#39;re returned to their schools. In any
case they&amp;#39;re not ATRs. Teachers that are repeatedly found to be
unsatisfactory are likewise removed (although the process here is
ridiculous and unfair as well).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
ATRs like any pool of teachers run the gamut. Some are great, some are
poor, many will fall in between. All are stigmatized and treated like
damaged goods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
People ask, how can a good teacher get into the ATR pool? As I said,
be at a closeout school. In the year before I was able to bring my friend
and former colleague JonAlf over to Stuy, he was at Brandeis High
School - a
closeout school. I tried to bring him over that year but his principal
wouldn&amp;#39;t release him. Had I not been successful in bringing him over
the following year he might very well have ended up in the ATR pool
and he&amp;#39;s one of the best teachers I know. What about the teacher that
doesn&amp;#39;t want to abandon those kids that the DOE abandoned when they
decided to close the school. That martyr teacher surely ends up in the
ATR pool but that&amp;#39;s the type of dedicated teacher every principal
should want.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So now we have a bunch of stigmatized teachers looking for work in a
system that won&amp;#39;t give them a chance. Not only due to them being
considered &amp;#34;damaged goods&amp;#34; but also because they&amp;#39;re expensive to
hire.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When a school gets an ATR to them, it&amp;#39;s free - the cost isn&amp;#39;t added to
their budget - they keep them as extra manpower for the year and then
throw them out with the trash. At times, they get some credit for
keeping them a second year and even beyond they can get rid of them
whenever they want. Great way to bust the contract.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A clear example of this is Stuy&amp;#39;s  current math chair. He&amp;#39;s an ATR
Assistant Principal. They got him for free for the first year and I
believe at a 50% discount for the second and even now they can dump
him whenever they want. This is rubbish – he&amp;#39;s either good enough for
the position or he&amp;#39;s not. If he is, he should be given the job for
real and if he isn&amp;#39;t then what is he still doing there. I&amp;#39;m not making
any value judgment on him or the department but it&amp;#39;s either one or the
other.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, a big reason for this ATR mess is about budgets and money. The
problem is that it&amp;#39;s a big lie.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The DOE pretends the we have a situation like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/atr1.png&#34; alt=&#34;/img/atr1.png&#34; title=&#34;/img/atr1.png&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; height=&#34;250&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The DOE has money and schools have money. The schools pay for their
teachers, supplies, and everything else but the ATRS are paid for by
the DOE. Of course this isn&amp;#39;t the case. The truth is that the DOE pays
for everything:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/atr2.png&#34; alt=&#34;/img/atr2.png&#34; title=&#34;/img/atr2.png&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; height=&#34;250&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
ALL the money comes from the DOE.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the past the DOE has come up with poorly conceived and poorly
received plans on how to deal with the ATR situation but it&amp;#39;s really
quite simple.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Start by recognizing that ALL the money comes from the DOE. Once you
do that you can address the problem:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Assign the ATR to a school
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the school likes the ATR and the ATR likes the school, they keep
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
them and the DOE picks up the tab or rather adjusts the schools
budget to compensate. The DOE will continue to do so until a real
opening occurs at the school in the ATR&amp;#39;s area at which point the
ATR fills the position officially and the budget is readjusted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the school or ATR don&amp;#39;t like each other the ATR gets rotated,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
however you create a 3 strikes (or maybe 2 or 4 or some number)
rule.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the school keeps sending away ATRs semester after semester hit
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
them with a penalty or force an ATR placement when they have an
opening (assuming the ATR is amenable).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the ATR keeps declining positions after a set number of
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
schools force the placement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s it. Simple and solves the problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New York State moving forward with CS Teacher Certification</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ny-cs-certificate/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ny-cs-certificate/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Last April I woke up early and trekked up to Albany along with a few
of my Hunter College colleagues to share our thoughts on K12 Computer
Science teacher certification with the Board of Regents. We gave a
presentation to the Regents Higher Education Committee and afterwards
had a chance to talk with some of the Regents as well as other members
of the New York State Department of Education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I left feeling that our proposals were well received and I think
everyone present - both the Hunter and NYSED contingents hoped that
things would move forward on this important issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fast forward to today, December 8, 2017. I was up at the crack
of dawn. Driving in the dark in the snow from NYC to Albany to once
again attend a Board of Regents Higher Education Committee
meeting. This time, the agenda item was:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Proposed Amendments to Part 30 of the Regents Rules and Section 52.21
and Part 80 the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education Relating
to a New Certification Area and Tenure Area for Computer Science
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No discussion or debate this time around just the proposal. If I
understand the process correctly, this should come up again at the
March meeting at which point it will be voted on. If approved, it
looks like we&amp;#39;ll have a pathway towards certification for CS teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven&amp;#39;t had a chance to dive into the details but at the meeting a
few key points came up:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As the proposal indicates this will be a subject area in which a
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
teacher can be certified and be awarded tenure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There will be a traditional pathway for new teachers - Bachelors /
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Masters degree
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There will be an alternative pathway for people entering from the
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
workforce
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There will be an extension for teachers with another license so they
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
won&amp;#39;t have to give up tenure in their current license.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There will be an &amp;#34;individual evaluation&amp;#34; pathway which sounds to me
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
like it could catch people who fall through the cracks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There looks to be a sensible ramp up period - until September 2022
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s a grandfathering provision that looks to last 10 years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This sounds like a smart sensible plan. Multiple pathways, shallow
ramp up and provisions to protect existing teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, the devil is in the details. What&amp;#39;s an approved program?
Can a grandfathered teacher teach all CS classes or just intro ones?
etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I said, I haven&amp;#39;t had a chance to dive into the details yet but
this is very exciting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Prior to the meeting I was chatting with a few other people
attending. One, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uft.org/&#34;&gt;UFT&lt;/a&gt; representative was very excited about the
prospect. Another contingent, a group from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nysut.org/&#34;&gt;NYSUT&lt;/a&gt; was very much against
a new certification area. Their position was that this would create a
teacher shortage because no one would have a CS license and no one
would get one due to the difference in salary between teaching and the
tech industry. I&amp;#39;ve already written on how I feel that this is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/will-we-lose-cs-teachers-to-industry&#34;&gt;red
herring&lt;/a&gt;. What shocked me though was their feeling that &amp;#34;we already
have many non-CS teachers effectively teaching CS across the
state. They&amp;#39;re doing a great job and don&amp;#39;t need any additional content
or pedagogical knowledge.&amp;#34; I think they&amp;#39;re wrong and I also think that
when we as a community talk about how our summer professional
development is all that&amp;#39;s needed, we undercut CS education and
the teaching profession as a whole.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event this was a big step for New York. I tried to individually
thank as many of the participants as I could for helping shepherd this
along but could only speak to a few so I&amp;#39;ll just give a blanket thank
you here to the NY State Board of Regents, Board of Education and
State Education department.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
This past weekend was &lt;a href=&#34;http://catskillsconf.com&#34;&gt;Catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt; - my favorite event of the
year. I spent the weekend up in Ulster County with a bunch of my
students. some great friends old and new, and Devorah. It was a great
weekend but I was mostly offline.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a result I missed a rather heated discussion in the CS Ed Facebook
groups. The debate was over whether or not Strong AP CSP exam results
are indicative of a good curriculum or good professional development (PD).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
TL;DR - NO!!!!!
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Further, anyone who thinks that a set of exam results can tell you
that a particular PD sequence or curriculum is good shouldn&amp;#39;t be
allowed to call themselves a teacher and I don&amp;#39;t want them anywhere
near my kids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I guess that language is strong, even for me but it&amp;#39;s true.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tests are designed to assess students and many tests don&amp;#39;t even do
that well. They shouldn&amp;#39;t be used to measure something further
removed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The last time this idea made its rounds was using student test results
for teacher evaluation. They do that in NY. A judge called the
practice &amp;#34;capricious&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;arbitrary.&amp;#34; My friend and former
colleague Gary Rubinstein showed a year or so ago that standardized
test scores varied enough from year to year so as to make the ratings
useless [fn::sorry, I just got back from the weekend trip and am too tired
to find the link. You can go to his site and search and while you&amp;#39;re
there, there&amp;#39;s lots of good stuff to read.]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using test scores to say a PD sequence is good? What if that PD
focused on test prep? What if it did nothing in particular? When I was
at Stuy and when I was at Seward Park the Calc teachers&amp;#39; students had
great AP results. I can tell you that none of those teachers had any
quality PD specific to AP Calc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Curriculum? My mentor and friend Danny Jaye told me many times - &amp;#34;A
great teacher can save a class from a  horrible curriculum but a great
curriculum will do nothing for a class with a horrible teacher.&amp;#34; He
was right. Again, what if the curriculum encourages test prep. What if
pressure on the teacher encourages them to focus on test prep
regardless of curriculum or PD (see my recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/standards-who-for&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An AP test measures one thing - how well the student did on the AP
test. There are so many variables that go into a class:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is it first period at 8:00am?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is it the last class of the day?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is it before lunch or right afterwards?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about right after Gym.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What&amp;#39;s the mix of students - every class is different
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is the teacher teaching the subject once a day? Two times? Five
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
times?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How large is the class
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How many other classes are the kids taking?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The list goes on and on. There are so many contributing factors that
you just can&amp;#39;t say &amp;#34;Good test results = good curriculum&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;good test
results = good PD.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Want to know if a curriculum is good - have experienced teachers who
know their subject run it a few times through and ask them. Same for
PD.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teachers know education a lot better than test makers, curriculum
developers and PD providers. How about listening to them for a change?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Standards - Who are they for?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/standards-who-for/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/standards-who-for/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The big push at last year&amp;#39;s CSTA conference was the release of the new
CSTA K12 standards. It seemed that every other session was pushing
them in one way or another. I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to share my thoughts
about them or, more specifically, learning standards in general for a
while but with announcement about federal funding for CS coming from
the White House last week I thought it was time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before diving into CS standards lets talk about math.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start I have yet to meet a math teacher that needs
&amp;#34;the Standards&amp;#34; to know what to teach. Some how or other math teachers know
they&amp;#39;re supposed to teach in an algebra or geometry class. When NY
moved to &amp;#34;integrated math&amp;#34; teachers were able to re-sequence classes
without the benefit of &amp;#34;the standards&amp;#34; and when NY went back to
Algebra, Geometry, then Alg 2 and Trig, teachers had no problem
reorganizing classes again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
New teachers didn&amp;#39;t go to &amp;#34;the Standards&amp;#34; to learn the ropes. Schools
defined syllabi, teachers observed each other, shared resources, used
lesson plan books and in general knew what they were supposed to teach
and at what level.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my quarter century of teaching, always in a math department we
spent a lot of time talking about what we taught, when we taught it,
how we taught it and at what level but until common core was forced
down our throats we NEVER discussed &amp;#34;the Standards.&amp;#34; We discussed our
students, where we thought we could take them, and how to get them
there. Somehow our students did alright.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
More recently, the push has been on &amp;#34;The Standards,&amp;#34; common core in particular.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Common standards sound good - kids in every school will learn the same
things at the same level - but I contend that they aren&amp;#39;t about
learning. They&amp;#39;re about testing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s look at a few of the math standards. These were pulled directly
from the Common Core:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Derive the equation of a circle of given center and radius using the
Pythagorean Theorem; complete the square to find the center and radius
of a circle given by an equation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Use coordinates to prove simple geometric theorems algebraically. For
example, prove or disprove that a figure defined by four given points
in the coordinate plane is a rectangle; prove or disprove that the
point (1, √3) lies on the circle centered at the origin and containing
the point (0, 2).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Derive using similarity the fact that the length of the arc
intercepted by an angle is proportional to the radius, and define the
radian measure of the angle as the constant of proportionality; derive
the formula for the area of a sector.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These aren&amp;#39;t about deep thinking and problem solving. They&amp;#39;re about
very specific skills or techniques. They&amp;#39;re also easy to put on a
test. Much easier then assessing a students real problem solving ability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Common Core comes hand in hand with standardized testing which is then
used to punish students, teachers, and schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We keep hearing about individualized instruction - meeting the kids
where they are but the standards tell us that kids MUST know specific
things at specific times. You can&amp;#39;t have both. In the best case, with
&amp;#34;the standards&amp;#34; we can only meet students &amp;#34;where they are&amp;#34; within
annual bands.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What has this led to? Narrowing curriculum for one thing. Since schools are
evaluated based on the standardized exam in core subjects focus
narrows and other subjects fall by the wayside.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Arguably worse is selective teaching within common core subjects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Take for example, Geometry. The course is really &amp;#34;Logic and Deductive
Reasoning using Euclidean Geometry as a Platform&amp;#34; but it&amp;#39;s generally
called Geometry. This class is supposed to be about getting kids to
think. I&amp;#39;ve already shared a few standards above but let me tell you
about an open secret - many schools don&amp;#39;t really teach proof -
arguably the most important part of the class.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my last year at Stuy I graded Geometry regents for the city. I
graded exams for two highly regarded unscreened schools. One that was
lauded in a State of the Union address and the other equally hyped. I
graded all of each school&amp;#39;s students geometry regents so it wasn&amp;#39;t
just a sampling. Out of all the papers, only two or three scored more
than 2 out of 9 points for the proof question and most were entirely
left blank.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What happened? Proof is hard to teach and hard to learn but it&amp;#39;s also
only a small part of the standardized exam. It&amp;#39;s critical for a
school&amp;#39;s survival and for the student to graduate that a passing score
is earned. Rather than spending a large amount of time on few points
and probably get a limited return I&amp;#39;ve been told that many schools
spend much more time on topics that area easier to teach and have more
weight on the exam. This makes the school look better and helps the
student graduate but arguably the most important aspect of the course
has been minimized.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
High stakes testing leads to gaming the system. Common core standards
come hand in hand with high stakes testing. We see the same with AP
exams - there are schools that force students to take exams even when
they are woefully prepared and mostly fail because this helps the
school shoot up in the ratings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is what the common core math standards have given us. They&amp;#39;re not
for teachers - we don&amp;#39;t need them - we know what to teach and only
wish that the bean counters would indeed allow us to meet students
where they are. Standards are about testing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s move on to CS standards.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It might not be fair to compare CS to math since K12 math education
has been around much longer and is more well defined and in theory
having a set of standards gives us a common language to discuss,
compare, and contrast all the content providers and curriculum
developers out there. On the other hand, I also believe that with well
prepared teachers who understand content and pedagogy the value isn&amp;#39;t
all that great. It&amp;#39;s also worth considering the fact that nothing
really makes the CSTA Standard  writers special. There&amp;#39;s no reason to
think that another group - be they a handful of teachers or a content
provider can&amp;#39;t do a comparable job.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here are some selections from the CSTA standards:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Design and develop a software artifact working in a team.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Compare and contrast various software licensing schemes (e.g., open source, freeware,
commercial).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Design, develop, and implement a computing artifact that responds to an event (e.g., robot
that responds to a sensor, mobile app that responds to a text message, sprite that responds
to a broadcas
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Demonstrate the value of abstraction for managing problem complexity (e.g., using a list
instead of discrete variables).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Design algorithms u sing sequence, selection, and iteration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Discuss techniques used to store, process, and retrieve different amounts of information
(e.g., files, databases, data warehouses).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Compare and debate the positive and negative impacts of computing on behavior and
culture (e.g., evolution from hitchhiking to ridesharing apps, online accommodation rental
services).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Use simple encryption and decryption algorithms to transmit/receive an encrypted
message.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Decompose a problem by creating new data types, functions, or classes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Evaluate algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching) in terms of their efficiency, correctness, and
clarity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Use data analysis to identify significant patterns in complex systems (e.g., take existing data
sets and make sense of them).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with these. They aren&amp;#39;t specific enough to
develop lessons from but, they can provide a
consistent framework to discuss different offerings. Were the much
more specific, we&amp;#39;d have the same issue I railed about with the math
standards so this is a good thing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Actually, in general, I don&amp;#39;t have a problem with these standards. I
might agree with some parts and disagree with others but that&amp;#39;s
neither here nor there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To me the big concern on standards is what will they actually be used
for. It&amp;#39;s nice to think that it&amp;#39;s a set of guidelines from which we
can develop strong local experiences but I think this is somewhat
naive. As states and the federal government bring CS Education into
the fold there&amp;#39;s no reason to believe that CS will be special. CS Ed
will go the way of other subject areas. That means that whatever
standards governments adopt, they will likely be used for high stakes
tests rather than for true education. If you look to see how the
sausage is made you can see the harm standards and standardized
testing has wrought  in subjects like math. CS Ed won&amp;#39;t be far behind.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While we should be proud of all the work that&amp;#39;s going on in our
community it&amp;#39;s more important now than ever to keep an eye on the
overall big picture and be aware of how work intended for one purpose
within the community can be used very differently by those outside of
it. This is particularly important for advocates  not in public schools. Public
schools educate the majority of American students so CS4All means
public schools. Standardized testing won&amp;#39;t affect private schools (or
private charters in many cases) nor will they affect colleges and in
fact will be a boon to EdTech companies selling there wares. Many of
the loudest voices in CSEd come from these contingents - it&amp;#39;s
important that they look to the greater issues, form their own
opinions, and then act on what they believe is right.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is the new Secret Sauce ever better?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/is-the-new-secret-sauce-ever-better/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/is-the-new-secret-sauce-ever-better/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I read &lt;a href=&#34;http://nancyebailey.com/2017/09/05/xq-super-schools-business-working-to-end-public-high-schools/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; piece earlier today on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/NancyEBailey1&#34;&gt;Nancy Bailey&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s blog.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
TL;DR (although it really isn&amp;#39;t too long so you should read it) - it&amp;#39;s
on Laurene Powell Jobs, her efforts to &amp;#34;reform&amp;#34; education and why
she&amp;#39;s misguided as are most of the well to do non-educators working
hard to change and in many cases privatize public education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Laura posts a nice list of simple, common sense ways to improve
education. I&amp;#39;ll repost them here:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For years, research has shown that high school students need more sleep. They should have later start times. .
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Smaller class sizes would help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Make sure teachers don’t have so many preparation plans.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
End advanced placement classes (IMHO).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Improve career-technical classes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Provide rich extra-curricular activities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bring back life skill classes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Include a social justice curriculum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Include students on the disciplinary board.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Provide civics education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Make sure students get opportunities to participate in the arts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Work to include the community.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ensure students have access to counselors, and school support staff.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Every high school should have a great library, a real librarian, and technology and books.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looks very much like what those elite private schools that those rich
non-educators send their kids to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other day I also overheard a conversation between two
professors. One noted that they had just taught a course totally
online for the first time and that the professor really had fun doing
it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These got me thinking more about all the secret sauce and magic
bullets coming from tech to save education - things like MOOCS or  &amp;#34;personalized&amp;#34;
learning system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started to wonder - have these &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; been pushed on public
schools because they&amp;#39;re better or rather because they cut costs (or in
the slightly better case to reach a student that otherwise wouldn&amp;#39;t
have any opportunity which, in a way is generally cost related).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I couldn&amp;#39;t come up with a single instance. They&amp;#39;re always a way to
replace what I consider personalized instruction – you know, when a
teacher has a small class and can personally deal with, learn about,
interact with, and teach the child. Kids spend hours in front of a
screen instead of working with others. Kids do a MOOC (or maybe drop
out of a MOOC) so that you can have your student/teacher ratio reach
ridiculous levels. I&amp;#39;ve never seen any tech solution rolled out to
public schools because it&amp;#39;s better. Only to cut costs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How do I know that it&amp;#39;s not better? Well, we have Nancy&amp;#39;s list
above. It&amp;#39;s what those rich people pay all that money to the elite
private schools for.  If all these solutions the Jobs and Gates of the
world were so much better, wouldn&amp;#39;t they insist upon them  for their
own children?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just some Friday food for thought.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Cost of AP Exams</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cost-of-ap-exams/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cost-of-ap-exams/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Now that I&amp;#39;m back from vacation and summer&amp;#39;s winding down I thought
I&amp;#39;d start getting back to more classroom related posts. I still have a
few summer topics I want to write about – standards and side projects
in particular but I&amp;#39;m also looking forward to talking more about the
classroom since, after all, at my core, I&amp;#39;m a teacher. When I saw &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2017/08/how_online_textbooks_could_help_more_students_take_ap_exams.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;
article in my inbox this morning I thought I&amp;#39;d talk about it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the piece, Lindsey Tepe since more kids are taking AP classes and
they&amp;#39;re very expensive, schools should look to lower other costs
related to AP classes so as to provide financial support so that
students can take that oh so important end of year exam:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While the College Board continues to reimburse about one-third of the
test cost for eligible low-income students, only about half of states
are now offering any further financial assistance for students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ms. Tepe&amp;#39;s solution? Lower text book costs. As a way of lowering
school costs, I&amp;#39;m all for it. I&amp;#39;ve used free online resources in lieu
of textbooks for years but the savings should go somewhere where it
can make a difference. Perhaps lowering class sizes. The fatal flaw in
Ms. Teps&amp;#39;s piece is that it continues spinning the misplaced narrative
that AP Exams are a very important part of a child&amp;#39;s education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s be reminded of something: The AP Exam is one thing - an exam - a
single test at the end of the year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The narrative is that students should take more and more AP classes,
that they&amp;#39;re somehow better for kids. Part of this is due to the
potential college credit and part is because the public has been
bamboozled by the ridiculous school ratings that give credit for AP
classes taken. Back in &amp;#34;the day,&amp;#34; AP classes were basically early
college. You could then argue that they were the most rigorous classes
offered in a school. AP Calc was basically college Calc. Same for
APCS-AB, AP-Bio and the rest. Now, with classes like APCS-P aimed to
be accessible to typical high school students in the lower grades,
they can&amp;#39;t (but still will) make that claim. In fact, at Stuy, my
former school, there are plenty of non AP classes that are more
rigorous than AP classes and the best AP teachers don&amp;#39;t always cover
the whole syllabus because they&amp;#39;re more concerned with their students
actually learning rather than scoring 5 on an exam.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the college credit front, if a student has a high probability of
saving money through AP credit then I&amp;#39;m all for it but otherwise, it&amp;#39;s
just money going to the college board.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It seems ridiculous for me to have to write this but the important
part of a class is, you know, the class. Not the single exam given by
an outside agency at the end and graded after the semester concludes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My suggestion? Offer college level work to students that are ready for
it but don&amp;#39;t push the AP exam. This would save a ton of money. What value
does the college board actually bring to the table? Remember, they&amp;#39;re
making a pretty penny on all of this testing. A math teacher should be
able to teach calculus with or without AP. A good text being used by
that teacher in class - be it free or paid for is actually much more
important to a student learning calculus than a single exam taken at
the end of the year. I&amp;#39;d go further and say that I&amp;#39;d trust the
teacher&amp;#39;s exam more than the college board&amp;#39;s. If a teacher knows the
math but needs to see some sample syllabi, they&amp;#39;re a web search
way. The same is true for most other college courses that have AP
equivalents and maybe even more so for computer science.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the day it should be about students learning not about
students taking high stakes exams.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thoughts on non educator  influences on CS Education</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/outside-influences-on-cs-ed/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/outside-influences-on-cs-ed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/guzdial&#34;&gt;Mark Guzdial&lt;/a&gt; blogged about a NY Times piece discussing
&lt;a href=&#34;https://computinged.wordpress.com/2017/07/28/silicon-valley-pushing-coding-into-american-classrooms-through-code-org-nytimes/&#34;&gt;Silicon Valleys influence on education through Code.org&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mark questioned the validity of the piece. If you don&amp;#39;t read Mark&amp;#39;s
blog and you&amp;#39;re in CS Ed you probably should.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tried to leave a comment on Mark&amp;#39;s blog - not about the NY Times
article but rather my thoughts on why I think it&amp;#39;s important that we
remain wary and vigilant to industry and outsiders influence and
impact on CS education and on education in general.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know if my comment is sitting waiting for Mark to moderate or
if I&amp;#39;m experiencing WordPress weirdness but since it hasn&amp;#39;t shown up
there, I thought I&amp;#39;d share it here:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While the article might not make a strong case it&amp;#39;s important to be wary of outside influences on education policies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m a fan of a lot of what code.org does but speaking about outsiders in general…
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bill Gates and Co. directly or indirecty gave us such delights like stack ranking teachers, improving, I mean evaluating, I mean firing teachers based on test scores of students they don&amp;#39;t teach, more and more high stakes nonsense testing for kids, and  at least in NY the destruction of neighborhood schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They&amp;#39;ve also pushed the current charter movement that, aided by misleading stats appear successful but in truth are no better and frequently worse than public schools while not sharing back a single &amp;#34;best practice.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then we have private companies like the College Board and Pearson both of whom have an outsized influence on US Ed policy and curriculum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t doubt the good intentions of code.org - as I said, I&amp;#39;m a fan. I am concerned when they and others take actions that can affect ed policy. I&amp;#39;m concerned when code.org representative pushes students to take an AP exam - not a great CS course with a great CS teacher but the actual exam. I&amp;#39;m even more concerned when code.org offers free PD when a school signs up for the PSAT8/9 - another high stakes meaningless test at taxpayer expense. For code.org it&amp;#39;s a means to  get more CS ed out there. To me it&amp;#39;s setting up a new cash cow for the college board at my expense and at students expense.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve seen many Ed Tech people, armed with the best intentions, enter the lions den – a school, district, or municipality only to see their best intentions corrupted in the name of cost cutting, profits, or politics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>CS Ed advocates should pay attention to greater ed issues</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-ed-and-all-ed/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-ed-and-all-ed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
For anyone involved in K12 CS education, the past few years have been
a wild ride. When I first tried to make inroads in the DOE decades ago
I couldn&amp;#39;t get through the door. Now, CS Education is everyone&amp;#39;s
darling. It&amp;#39;s really amazing. It&amp;#39;s been a combination of grass roots
efforts by teachers, non profit education efforts such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://teals12k.org&#34;&gt;TEALS&lt;/a&gt;, advocacy of
groups like &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.org&#34;&gt;Code.org&lt;/a&gt; and amazing individuals like &lt;a href=&#34;http://avc.com/2017/06/bearing-witness/&#34;&gt;Fred Wilson&lt;/a&gt; who has
probably done more to move the needle of CS Ed in NY than any other 10
people combined.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While everyone agrees that to do CS education right at the K12 level
we need great teachers and lots of them, everyone also knows that
teachers voices are often unheard. The voices with the greatest weight
belong to the large non-profits, principals, superintendents and
local politicians.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today&amp;#39;s post is a plea to those with voices to think about the effects
of their advocacy for CS Ed to the greater education landscape.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started thinking about this recently as I&amp;#39;ve been developing the
CS teacher certification programs for Hunter College. As I spoke to
people across the nation I found that many of the efforts to
developing teacher certification are what I call the &amp;#34;you take it you
teach it&amp;#34; model. You take an abbreviated version of APCS-A and APCS-P
and you&amp;#39;re a certified CS teacher. Just about every real educator feels
that this is ludicrous. Some feel that this can be a first step - get
these credentials to get in the door and then you have three to five
years to really learn your subject and craft. I&amp;#39;m good with that but I
have a problem with anyone who says &amp;#34;you take it you teach it&amp;#34; is good
enough and I&amp;#39;ve heard of a number of regions that are seriously
considering it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why is this so bad and, I&amp;#39;d argue, dangerous? Not merely because we&amp;#39;ll
end up with substandard CS teachers for the foreseeable future but
also because it undermines the teaching profession as a whole.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s no secret that public education is under attack. A number of
states including Wisconsin, Arizona, Oklahoma, New York and Michigan
have considered relaxing the standards to become a teacher to address
a teacher shortage. In their twisted logic, the politicians and
&amp;#34;reformers&amp;#34; say that we can&amp;#39;t find enough qualified teachers because
we&amp;#39;ve made it an untenable career so let&amp;#39;s lower standards. You can
argue that any current state&amp;#39;s requirements are overly cumbersome but
that&amp;#39;s another conversation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When CS Educators say that all that&amp;#39;s needed to teach CS is to sit in
on a two week APCS institute is saying that to teach any subject you
don&amp;#39;t need content expertise. This is dangerous to education as a
whole and when power players in the CS Ed movement don&amp;#39;t speak up
otherwise or even worse that the stance that &amp;#34;you take it you teach
it&amp;#34; is OK, we&amp;#39;re undermining teaching as a profession.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We need our heavy hitters to publicly and privately say that we need a
short term entry into the profession but we absolutely need plans and
pathways so that at the end of the day we have the best prepared
teachers in our schools for CS and for all subjects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another issue is when as CS Educators we don&amp;#39;t pay attention to the
whole child. I was at a meeting of CSTA people  from about thirty
states a few years ago. Someone asked &amp;#34;how can we advocate for CS when
the school might use it as an excuse to get rid of music?&amp;#34; Cameron
Wilson, at the time a lobbyist for the ACM said something to the
effect of &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m not concerned with other subjects, my concern is
getting CS into the schools.&amp;#34; I get it, he was employed to stump CS
but we have to remember that we&amp;#39;re only a piece of the puzzle. We want
a seat at the table but we have to make sure that the table is
populated with everyone needed to provide a great education for our
kids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A final issue I&amp;#39;ll mention here is how so many CS educators are so
close to the College Board. It was very disturbing that so many CS Ed
players were pushing for more students to take the APCS exam. Not the
class, not some other CS class but the APCS exam. AP is an extremely
controversial subject among teachers and many of us feel that too many
kids take too many AP classes and certainly too many exams. Remember,
the College Board is the organization that pushes things like the
PSAT8/9 another meaningless but high stakes exam inflicted upon our
kids at taxpayer expense. I understand that AP makes things easy -
they have courses, curricula, etc. but we&amp;#39;ve given the college board
an outsized influence on CS education and we&amp;#39;re not paying attention
to their outsized influence on education in general.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m just a small time teacher. I don&amp;#39;t have a national voice. I&amp;#39;m
urging those that do:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Look into what&amp;#39;s going on in greater education. Look at the way
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
public education has been under attack and why.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Look at the side affects of our choices - who we partner with and
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
what policies we push.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We might not agree on the right path but everyone with a voice in CS
Education should be having hard conversations about this and then
strongly advocating for the positions they feel correct.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Self Certification - not a good idea</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/dont-self-certify/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/dont-self-certify/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
You&amp;#39;ve probably seen an image like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/dont-self-certify/self-signed.png&#34; alt=&#34;/img/dont-self-certify/self-signed.png&#34; title=&#34;/img/dont-self-certify/self-signed.png&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s what you see when you try to access a secure web site but the web
site itself certified itself as being secure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When people see this on a professional site it sets off all manner of
red flags. We feel much more comfortable when go to a site and we
don&amp;#39;t see that error. When we see the secure green lock in the url bar
indicating that this site is certified through an external trusted
source.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s take this a step further. If you needed surgery would you go to
a board certified surgeon or would you go to Dr. Nick Riviera or some
other &amp;#34;self certified&amp;#34; doctor? Likewise you wouldn&amp;#39;t want to be
represented in court by someone who hasn&amp;#39;t passed the bar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We might not feel that these certification and licensing processes are
perfect but when we need the services of a doctor or lawyer, we&amp;#39;re
happy these gatekeepers exist.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So we should all be extremely concerned with today&amp;#39;s announcement that
the deal for mayoral control just brokered in NYC came with strings
attached and one of those strings looks to open the doors to give some
charter chains the ability to self certify their teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s a story on it in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2017/07/06/with-city-charters-poised-to-win-certification-deal-education-schools-fret-113243&#34;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt; and one in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2017/07/06/some-charter-school-teachers-could-become-certified-without-a-masters-under-proposed-new-suny-rules/&#34;&gt;Chalkbeat&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One might think that some requirements to become a teacher are
ridiculous. I&amp;#39;ll get to them later  but this is really giving the fox
the keys to the henhouse.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Charters appear to have extremely high rates of teacher attrition so
it makes sense that they want to control their teacher pipeline. This
alone should be a red flag against self certification but what else
are charter chains known for?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Misleading stats - claiming amazing passing numbers on standardized
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
exams while neglecting to mention that somehow or other big blocks
of students were removed from the school prior to the test year
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shankerinstitute.org/blog/student-attrition-and-backfilling-success-academy-charter-schools-what-student-enrollment&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The gotta go list
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Forcing high levels of parent involvement (tough for single working
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
parents)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Charging &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/education/article/KIPP-schools-collected-millions-in-unallowable-11257006.php&#34;&gt;illegal fees&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Top this off with as taking resources from public schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Charters operate in anything but a transparent manner and we&amp;#39;re
expected to trust them to prepare &amp;#34;highly effective&amp;#34; teachers? I don&amp;#39;t
think so. Since there is no real accountability for charter schools -
they can easily game the system through student attrition, selective
admissions (by putting up barriers to enter the lottery) and test prep
they can pay lip service to teacher preparation and the public will be
none the wiser.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we had a reasonable way of holding principals accountable and no,
test scores are not the answer then we could pretty much do away
with teacher certification. If principals were held to task to run an
effective school, something we can easily define but not measure, then
they would have every incentive to hire the best
teachers. Unfortunately we&amp;#39;re nowhere near that place.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since we&amp;#39;re not, we&amp;#39;re left with the current systems of teacher
certification that has it&amp;#39;s own slew of problems. A big part of it, in
my opinion is that schools of education have lost the high
ground. While there are some institutions doing great work, reputation
wise, schools of education are held in very low regard. Strong
teachers trade stories of the watered down content classes and waste
of time classes where professors share their pet theories of
education. I can&amp;#39;t tell you how many times I&amp;#39;ve heard the new
definitive way to teach. At the same time, education research is
frequently held in low regard by teachers and the general public.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the one hand we have charters run by and support by non-educators
wanting us to trust them and on the other we have institutions that
are questioned by the teachers they produce and the general public.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What a mess.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know the answer. I&amp;#39;m working on teacher certifications
programs at Hunter and it&amp;#39;s a balancing act. How much content is
sufficient and how much is too much. Can any of the general content be
streamlined or is it all necessary. If it isn&amp;#39;t necessary do we need
it anyway to satisfy the bean counters?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you don&amp;#39;t have enough then we&amp;#39;re sending unprepared teachers into
the classroom. Too much and we&amp;#39;ll drive potential teachers away.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As computer science education is defining itself we see similar
struggles. We have some people advocating certifications analogous to
existing teacher certifications. On the other extreme we have
advocates for two weeks summer training and you&amp;#39;re a CS teacher. I&amp;#39;d
like to think that I&amp;#39;m advocating for the sweet spot. Strong content
knowledge not tied to a specific course and matching content related
pedagogy. Time will tell becomes the certification standard and time
will tell whose approach was right.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For now, it&amp;#39;s important not to give away the store. Private charter
schools should not be the driving force behind teacher certification
and they certainly shouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed to train their own teachers
and then &amp;#39;teach&amp;#39; our students without much greater scrutiny.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Addendum:
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m sure some of my friends will point out that private schools aren&amp;#39;t
held to any particular standard for teacher certification. This is
true but private schools don&amp;#39;t take public funds. Actually they do but
in my opinion, they shouldn&amp;#39;t. I maintain that charter schools are
publicly funded private schools in that they take public money but
operate as private entities. As such they should be held under the
greatest of scrutiny and standards – they aren&amp;#39;t
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CS Teachers - teacher first or content first</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/teacher-to-cs-or-cs-to-teacher/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/teacher-to-cs-or-cs-to-teacher/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Is it easier to take CS people and teach them to teach or is it easier
to take teachers and teach them CS?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The question gets batted around from time to time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This time via twitter:
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Some think it&amp;#39;s easier to teach a teacher to teach CS than to teach a CS pro to teach. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alfredtwo&#34;&gt;@alfredtwo&lt;/a&gt; is not one of them &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/QCUP8d8llZ&#34;&gt;https://t.co/QCUP8d8llZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Diane Levitt (@diane_levitt) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/diane_levitt/status/881874056911388673&#34;&gt;July 3, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Agreed. It takes a lot of work. More than a week long workshop.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Alfred Thompson (@alfredtwo) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alfredtwo/status/882243591090962432&#34;&gt;July 4, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34;
charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The conversation was referring to blog posts by &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/06/become-computer-science-teacher-in-five.html?spref=tw&amp;amp;m=1&#34;&gt;Alfred Thompson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gflint.wordpress.com/2017/06/20/a-week-of-in-service-another-python-course/&#34;&gt;Garth flint&lt;/a&gt;.
Alfred&amp;#39;s key point - one that I&amp;#39;ve spoken about before is that short
term professional development does not a CS teacher make.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As to the lead in question? I&amp;#39;ve seen both routes succeed and both
routes fail. Both can be heavy lifts but there&amp;#39;s a missing part of the
equation that&amp;#39;s never addressed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The claim is that it&amp;#39;s easier to teach CS to a non-CS teacher because
they already know how to teach. The problem is, particularly in the
later grades that teachers of different subject areas have very
different tool sets. Sure, there are common factors – get the kids
involved, layer, spiral, etc. but you don&amp;#39;t teach a CS lesson the same
way you teach a math lesson let alone a literature, history, language
lesson.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In a math class, it&amp;#39;s common to have students write solutions to
problems up on the board. If you try that in a CS class, you&amp;#39;ll be
waiting 20 minutes while the kids transcribe the problems. Likewise,
math homework will likely consist of a certain amount of repetitive
practice problems whereas a CS class won&amp;#39;t have something directly
analogous. This is not to say that you don&amp;#39;t have opportunities for
students to present at the board in CS class or that there isn&amp;#39;t
worthwhile homework but rather that even at this simple level, there
are differences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, if we&amp;#39;re going to teach a non-CS teacher the CS content, beyond
the challenge of giving them the necessary depth and breadth of
content knowledge we have to teach them how to teach CS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve inventoried some of the techniques my colleagues and I have used
in our classes and the collected methods could easily fill a couple of
graduate education courses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what&amp;#39;s the answer to the question? It doesn&amp;#39;t matter where you
start but if we want to do right by our kids we need to prepare them
in not two but three areas:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
CS Content
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
CS Pedagogy
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
General education and pedagogy
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Short term PD (professional development) won&amp;#39;t do it and neither will
scripts for &amp;#34;teachers&amp;#34; to follow. It&amp;#39;s going to take time, will, and
effort.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s hoping that municipalities look at the long game. It&amp;#39;s fine to
do PD now to get something started but it&amp;#39;s not enough. I wanted my
kids math teachers to know math and how to teach it. We should demand
no less from our CS teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Retaining Teachers</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/on-retaining-teachers/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/on-retaining-teachers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Back in February, I shared my thoughts on &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/will-we-lose-cs-teachers-to-industry&#34;&gt;losing CS teachers to the
tech industy&lt;/a&gt;. TL;DR - I don&amp;#39;t think it will be a CS Ed problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That said, I do think that it will be hard to find good CS teachers
but the reason is because it will get harder and harder to find good
teachers in general.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are plenty of reasons why it&amp;#39;s harder to become a
career teacher but I don&amp;#39;t want to talk about those today. There are
also plenty of powerful forces working to destroy public schools and
teaching as a career but this post isn&amp;#39;t about that either.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This post is my attempt to tell people what teachers are actually
looking for. Some people assert that merit pay or similar &amp;#34;real world&amp;#34;
incentives will keep good teachers teaching but teachers are a
different breed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, I can&amp;#39;t speak for all teachers but I can talk about myself
and teachers I&amp;#39;ve known and worked with over the years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I never thought I&amp;#39;d be a teacher, it was just something I tried when I
was dissatisfied with Wall Street. I tried it, it stuck. I didn&amp;#39;t feel
at the time that teaching was my calling but somehow or other, I made
a career of it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start, schools are not factories, companies, stores, or any other
type of business. Teachers spend most of their days with students and
little time with each other. Most of their time is allocated for
them. A high school teacher in NY will likely teach 5 class of 34 kids
each, have 1 period for lunch, 1 for preparation and 1 assigned to
some school task. You probably won&amp;#39;t see your supervisor much. Mostly
at monthly meetings and when they observe you. Observations are
ostensibly for teacher evaluation and improvement but the system is
does neither well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teachers also don&amp;#39;t have the same types of career paths as a other
professionals do. If you want to remain a classroom teacher, there is
no career path. You could become an assistant principal or principal
but those opportunities take you away from the kids and from your
subject area. They say teaching is a calling and for career classroom
teachers it probably is. For those who spent a few years in a
classroom and left for what they see as greener pastures, maybe not.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So instead teachers make a career by honing their craft, creating electives,
working with clubs and teams, or doing something similar that doesn&amp;#39;t
remove them from the classroom.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my case, I developed some electives and one thing led to another
and I ended up where I am today.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The career situation of the teacher is why things like merit pay never
work. As a teacher, I want, in fact need my colleagues to do well. I
might have your kids next year and if you do a poor job I&amp;#39;ll end up
suffering with the results. Sure, I&amp;#39;d like to be recognized as one of
the better teachers but it&amp;#39;s not healthy for my students, my school,
or my career if I&amp;#39;m pitted against my fellow teacher. We&amp;#39;re all in
this together.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teachers do accept merit pay when it&amp;#39;s forced on them though. As a
friend of mine once said - it&amp;#39;s like the teacher lottery - the way
they assign the merit bonuses are based on those bogus state exams so
the distribution is pretty random, one year I&amp;#39;ll get it, another year
someone else.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is not to say that teachers couldn&amp;#39;t use a higher salary but even
then, teachers are not driven by the same motivations as business
people. I don&amp;#39;t know of any teacher who feels that they&amp;#39;d work harder
for more pay or that they work any less hard if they&amp;#39;re paid less.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teachers work and fight for their kids because that&amp;#39;s what we
do. Right before I left Stuy for Hunter, the teachers and city agreed
to a new contract. All of a sudden I got a pay raise. I can tell you
that I was neither a better or worse of a teacher the day after the
contract went into affect than the day before.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My mentor and friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-11-07-rich-rich.html&#34;&gt;Richard Rothenberg&lt;/a&gt; talked to me about the deal we
make with society as teachers early in my career. He said, once you
get a few years in and have some seniority you&amp;#39;re pretty secure and
you&amp;#39;re only worry has to be teaching. We don&amp;#39;t do great in the good
times but we do OK. On the other hand, we still have jobs in the bad
times although, again, we don&amp;#39;t do great. We put in a lifetime of
service knowing that we won&amp;#39;t get any significant financial reward but
at the end of the day between our contributions and the city/state&amp;#39;s
investments we&amp;#39;ll get a pension and won&amp;#39;t be out in the cold in our
retirement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The point is that those of us meant to be teachers were never looking
for the fast track to the upper class. We work to make a difference
and want society to enable us to make that difference. Teachers don&amp;#39;t
have to be paid like they are in &amp;#34;the real world&amp;#34; but they do need to
put a roof over their heads, send their kids to college and have a
vacation now and again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s not too much to ask but in this day and age it&amp;#39;s apparently too
much to give.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mayoral Control - only when your guy&#39;s the mayor</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/mayoral-control/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/mayoral-control/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The hot debate this past week in NY Education circles is Mayoral
Control. When I started teaching, New York City schools were
controlled by the Board of Education. The board appointed a
chancellor. The system was supposed to balance community control as
well as some centralized decision making. The system was created in
the late 60s and was entrenched through my schooling. By the time I
was a teacher I think it was pretty much a given that the system
didn&amp;#39;t work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 2002, everything changed with Mayoral control under Michael
Bloomberg. Under mayoral control, the mayor appoints the chancellor
who appoints superintendents an on down the line. This was supposed to
create a chain of accountability leading up to and including the
mayor. To address concerns that parents voices would be heard, we had
the Panel for Educational Policy or PEP which was supposed to vet and
vote on policy and initiatives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sounds good.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, it was all a farce.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Parents may or may not have had a voice under the old system but they
certainly didn&amp;#39;t have a voice with mayoral control. The majority of
members of the panel were mayoral appointees and if they didn&amp;#39;t vote
100% in line with their masters wishes, they were removed for someone
who would. Schools were closed and initiatives were passed that were
wildly unpopular with parents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What did we get under mayoral control? There was some good, but we
also got:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
100% buy in to the pet education theories of non-educators like Bill
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
gates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
School leaders who barely taught and had little experience as
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
educators.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Destruction of neighborhood schools
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Destruction of just about all of the large comprehensive high schools
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Open doors for private charter schools that follow questionable
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
practices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Flawed (at best)  school and teacher evaluation models
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The ATR pool
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, reformers - those out to privatize education loved mayoral
control under Bloomberg. It destabilized teaching as a career
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Did results improve?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some would say yes but it&amp;#39;s debatable. Graduation rates and test
scores are controlled by the politicians. When you have tests made,
graded, and curved in secret (except for those charter schools that
are exempt or grade their own tests), you&amp;#39;ve got to question any gains
or losses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bloomberg&amp;#39;s failing was (and possibly still is) that he and his
appointees didn&amp;#39;t understand education or teachers. Education not a
business and can&amp;#39;t be treated the same way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Did this help with accountability? To quote Mr. Bloomberg: &amp;#34;They can
boo me at parades.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fast forward to the de Blasio administration. Personally, I was not a
fan of Bloomberg&amp;#39;s educational policy and I also feel that de Blasio&amp;#39;s
also doing a poor job. Regardless of my opinion, Mayoral control under
de Blasio has certainly felt more community friendly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This hasn&amp;#39;t sat well with the reformers upstate and while Michael
Bloomberg was granted mayoral control for his entire term, Bill de
Blasio has had to fight for it every year and every year control has
come with strings attached – generally involving the flow of money
into private charter schools - still with questionable practices and
results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The funny thing is that many of those saying mayoral control was bad
during the Bloomberg era say it&amp;#39;s a necessity now  and many against it
under Bloomberg are fans under de Blasio.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What&amp;#39;s even funnier, in a tragic way is that it isn&amp;#39;t really even
control. So much is really controlled in Albany under Governor
Cuomo. When de Blasio wanted to charge private charters for space
(rightfully so, in my opinion), Albany stepped in and gave the
charters a free pass. How is that mayoral control?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regardless of your political leanings, it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that mayoral
control is only a good thing when the mayor is your guy. We need
something brand new that supports our communities. I was at the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://personaldemocracy.com/conference&#34;&gt;Personal Democracy Forum 2017&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago and a recurring
theme, one which we really need now for our schools is:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;build with, not for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we don&amp;#39;t get there we&amp;#39;ll be stuck booing our politicians at parades.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Will we lose CS teachers to industry?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/draft-will-we-lose-cs-teachers-to-industry/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/draft-will-we-lose-cs-teachers-to-industry/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we properly prepare CS teachers, won&amp;#39;t they just jump ship and take
tech industry jobs?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I hear that a lot.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tech pays big. Teaching? Not so much. Tech workers are respected and
have flexible jobs. Teaching? Again, not so much.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Those chanting these refrains advocate the current simple teacher
&amp;#34;training&amp;#34; - scripted lessons, minimal pedagogical content knowledge,
even less real content knowledge. That  will keep them in the classroom.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They&amp;#39;re wrong.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
People fearing an exodus of prepared CS teachers don&amp;#39;t get
education. True, many young CS teachers will leave the profession but
that&amp;#39;s because &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;many young teachers leave the profession&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Why do young
teachers leave? Regardless of subject area some of the reasons are:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s much harder than everyone thinks it is
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Low pay
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lack of respect
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Overworked
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lack of autonomy
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Being scapegoated for poverty
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s become about testing, not teaching
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
None of these are unique to computer science teachers so the argument
that CS teachers who know too much will leave is really saying, &amp;#34;we
have to keep our teachers dumb enough to stay - make sure they don&amp;#39;t
have outside options&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;let&amp;#39;s make teaching a desirable
profession to be in.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, this is bred from a lack of understanding about what drives
teachers. It&amp;#39;s typical of politicians and business leaders and short
term temps like TFAers who came in for a cup of coffee and now know
how to solve the education problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teacher don&amp;#39;t become teachers to
get rich or to do better than the other guy – I know I didn&amp;#39;t. We
enter it to do good - to uplift the have nots. This is why business
models like stack ranking and bonus or merit pay just don&amp;#39;t work. A
school is a team and we&amp;#39;re all in it together. Our job is to take care
of our kids, not to be better than that other guy. We wish we had more
time to work together and to improve things for our entire population.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back to computer science.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My contention is that you might lose some teachers to industry but
they either weren&amp;#39;t meant to be teachers anyway or they couldn&amp;#39;t
afford to be teachers or the system beat them down. None of these are
reasons not to properly prepare them. Besides, all teachers in all
subject areas could work their way into an entry level tech job via a
summer coding boot camp.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We can also look to the past to allay concerns. While it&amp;#39;s true that
for hiring purposes, English teachers are a dime a dozen and
candidates typically
have fewer outside options (although great English teachers are harder
to find), Math and Science teachers generally have options. I know
many top Math and Science teachers who could easily get non teaching
jobs - the Math teachers in finance the science, certainly in
pharmaceutical companies over in NJ. These options exist yet we manage
to populate our classes with teachers. True, it&amp;#39;s difficult at times,
particularly in Physics, but these are due to the lack of respect
teaching gets as a profession.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we prepare CS teachers properly, yes, we&amp;#39;ll lose some, but we&amp;#39;ll
keep the ones we&amp;#39;re supposed to or if we lose them it will be due to
other factors. Additionally, by having proper CS teacher
preparation programs, we&amp;#39;ll also provide an entry path to those people
meant to be teachers but prior had no way of getting in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a nation, we&amp;#39;re moving away from prepared, knowledgeable teachers
and towards drill-masters. Let&amp;#39;s not let CS Education go the way of
all ed.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Should CS Ed be in bed with the College Board</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-ed-in-bed-college-board/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-ed-in-bed-college-board/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m guessing my views  on this aren&amp;#39;t very popular -that&amp;#39;s OK, every
community needs a curmudgeon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A few years ago, I cautioned if we weren&amp;#39;t careful, once the big
players got involved, CS Ed would go the way of other disciplines, and
not in a good way. It looks like indeed we&amp;#39;re well on our way down
that road.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve ranted before about things like non-profits, drop in and summer
programs. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-07-learning-takes-time.html/#.WJXSS99vHmE&#34;&gt;STEM Oil Salesmen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-reference&#34;&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;footnote-reference-1&#34; href=&#34;#footnote-1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
selling easy fixes, exciting kids and parents, using the Think Method
just like Professor Harold Hill only to send the kids off where they
can blame a future teacher for failure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve also ranted about teacher preparation and how all the rage is
short term, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/scotland/#.WJXT999vHmE&#34;&gt;Superficial PD and scripted curricula&lt;/a&gt;  and my concern that
once the politicians can say CS is in the schools, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-03-04-expedient-vs-good.html/#.WJXT7d9vHmE&#34;&gt;we&amp;#39;ll be done&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been working towards getting CS to all students for most of my
career and while it&amp;#39;s wonderful to see us getting closer to the goal,
I&amp;#39;m seeing more and more signs that my caution is becoming
reality. and CS Ed is going the way of other Ed - aligned to testing
and more to the whims of the power players and politicians than to
teachers and students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other week I noticed, &lt;a href=&#34;http://teacherblog.code.org/post/156278055294/ap-cs-principles-could-make-history-how-can-we&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by Code.org trying to encourage
more students to take the APCSP exam - not encourage more students
take the class or some other class or to have more students be exposed
to CS but to actually sit for the APCSP exam. That post was followed
by &lt;a href=&#34;http://teacherblog.code.org/post/156689658029/ask-your-cs-principles-students-to-star-in-our&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; which also highlights actually taking the exam.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This didn&amp;#39;t sit well with me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What does the exam do for the kid? It doesn&amp;#39;t drive instruction - by
that time, any good teacher knows their student and is better served
by using their own &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ap-we-dont-trust-teachers/#.WJXbA99vHmE&#34;&gt;assessments&lt;/a&gt;. The college credit thing? I&amp;#39;m
skeptical. Fewer and fewer schools are giving credit for APCSA let
alone this new CS0 non major course. Blanket credit? Since full time
students pay for a range of credits, I&amp;#39;m still skeptical
here. Placement? It&amp;#39;s a course for non-majors - what exactly are you
placing out of?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Reasons not to take the exam?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If it doesn&amp;#39;t do anything for the kid, why take it
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stress of taking the exam
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are other ways of placing out of courses once in college
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Save the expense
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a general rule, I&amp;#39;m against forcing students to sit for
AP exams. At the extreme case, since we&amp;#39;ve been brainwashed to think
that a school that has lots of kids sitting for exams is good, I&amp;#39;ve
seen at least one case of a principal having all his kids sit for, and
just about all &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; AP Calculus - that is, get a 1 or 2 on the exam. This
principal had all his students take the exam, and only 2 scores were 3
or higher. This principal then parlayed his success into a higher
profile gig - he&amp;#39;s moved up in the world while setting up his students
to fail.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This follows last year&amp;#39;s announcement that code.org was &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-19-code-org-college-board.html/#.WJXbm99vHmE&#34;&gt;partnering with
the College Board&lt;/a&gt; - offering PD to teachers for free if the schools
signed up their students for the PSAT 8/9 - another meaningless
exam. So, we get teacher training light [fn::If you think that PD based
teacher training is OK, ask yourself if you want your own child&amp;#39;s
chemistry teacher to be a history teacher with a few weeks summer
training in chemistry] as long as the school pays for
the PSAT8/9 for every kid so that the kid can take yet another test
with really no value[fn::And I&amp;#39;m guessing the exam will be offered
during the day so teachers will proctor for free rather than be
allowed to, you know, teach their students.].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why should students pay for an AP exam that doesn&amp;#39;t do anything for
them? Why should Jane Q Taxpayer pay for exams that only server to
enrich the College Board.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
True, The College Board is a big player. They already have much more
influence of American High School education than they should. It&amp;#39;s
easy to climb on board the AP train for entre into our schools. The
question is, should we use positions of influence to push efforts that
might help our end but leave collateral damage to students and the public.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t doubt code.org&amp;#39;s sincerity in wanting good CS in all schools
nor the efforts or value as an advocate for CS Education. I&amp;#39;m
concerned that the desire to win big and win now is moving us in a
direction that we&amp;#39;ll regret years from now.

      <title>It&#39;s not one issue, it&#39;s the President and his enablers</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/trump-issues/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/trump-issues/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Like many of my fellow bloggers and tweeters, I generally keep this
site clear of political issues with the exception of those that are
directly related to education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, like many of my fellow bloggers and tweeters, this week has
provided a reason to break with that tradition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many people, including some friends, all more eloquent than I have
already posted, tweeted, and Facebooked  about the behavior of our
President and government.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Long time blogger &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/davewiner&#34;&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt; put together &lt;a href=&#34;http://trumpstatus.org/&#34;&gt;trumpstatus.org&lt;/a&gt; where he&amp;#39;s
collecting many of the issues that we&amp;#39;re all so alarmed with.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would add cabinet appointments to his list with my particular
personal concern over DeVos and the department of education. I&amp;#39;ve been
meaning to blog about that for a while - perhaps this week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My concern for today is something else. Every day, I see a new Trump
induced crisis and every day I see a different subset of my circles
respond. It&amp;#39;s not quite as bad as:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Socialist.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Jew.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
People are indeed speaking out, but I am concerned that people
are going to rise up for their personal issue and when placated go
back to business as usual - this is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the time for business as
usual.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With the ACA repeal, I saw concerns from my working class friends and
friends that work with lower earning populations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Going into the DeVos hearing, mostly educators - real educators not
astroturf reformers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With Friday&amp;#39;s order, the whole tech community came out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s part of a thread by tech activist &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/anildash&#34;&gt;Anil Dash&lt;/a&gt; calling out,
calling on, and crediting assorted tech players.
&lt;/p&gt;

We have to remember that all these order, policies, appointments, and
plans are coming from the same place - Donald Trump and those
politicians that are enabling him.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If he backs off on immigration, education issues remain, if he backs
off there, we still have ACA, if that eases up, what about Women&amp;#39;s
rights and on and on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This means we all have to get involved and stay involved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What have I been doing?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I finally joined the ACLU and set up a monthly donation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I subscribed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://dailyaction.org&#34;&gt;Daily Action&lt;/a&gt; so that I get a reminder each day of
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
someone I can call to make a difference.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m starting to accumulate my representatives phone numbers as I
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
make those calls and am trying to make at least a call a day to
remind our representatives who they work for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Education and advocacy
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And if you suggestions for me - please post them here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thus ends my not business as usual post. What&amp;#39;s going on in America is
not someone else&amp;#39;s problem - it&amp;#39;s all of our problem and we all have
to be active and vigilant to make it through tough times to come.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selling out or getting a seat at the table</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/selling-out-or-a-seat-at-the-table/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/selling-out-or-a-seat-at-the-table/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The other day, a friend posited a question on Facebook (paraphrased):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If called upon, would you take a job in an administration who&amp;#39;s policies you strongly
disagreed with?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Would you go work for an administration that you reviled in order to
get a seat at the table? To try to affect change from the inside or
would you consider yourself a sellout or worse, publicly promote
positions you disagree with.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tough question.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The original question implied national level positions. I&amp;#39;ve never and
will never breath such rarefied air but I have had such experiences
closer to ground level, both with DOE projects and also in
conversations with some charter chains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My take?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyone that knows me knows that I&amp;#39;ve had various dealings with the NYC
DOE and also knows that those dealings never resulted in outcomes I
was happy with. Over my time at Stuy, I had many philosophical
differences with Tweed (a common nickname for the NYC DOE as they&amp;#39;re
housed in the old Tweed courthouse) and these were times where I tried
to play nice to have a seat at the table.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once I was at a meeting that also included a number of tech industry
heavy hitters. After the meeting, one came over to me. He knew me
by having worked with my former students. I knew him by reputation. He
asked &amp;#34;do they really want our thoughts on this or are we just here so
that they can do what they wanted in the first place and then parade us out
to say that they consulted experts in the tech industry?&amp;#34; I honestly
didn&amp;#39;t know at the time but I had my doubts as to the DOE&amp;#39;s sincerity
in being open to either my views or this CTO&amp;#39;s As it turned out, they
just did want to parade us. Later in the process, I was told in a back
room that it would be wise of me not to publicly voice my thoughts
about the direction of one particular project.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So there you have it. I was given a seat at the table but only as long
as my views mirrored the views of those in power. Not really much of a
seat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve also sat down with some charter chains - chains that I&amp;#39;ve been
more than happy to denounce publicly. Why did I take the meetings?
Mostly to find out if I was mistaken in my position and if so, maybe
I could help them. Every time I&amp;#39;ve had such a meeting, however, I&amp;#39;ve
left the table with my feelings unchanged and knowing that I would
never willingly help them as I felt their practices were harmful to
kids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In one case, I took the seat but failed to affect change. In the other
I refused the seat. I&amp;#39;ll always take a meeting and I&amp;#39;ll always work
with someone who wants to help kids and who has an open mind but I&amp;#39;ve
found that the more powerful the player, at least in education, the
more likely they are to just want confirmation of their own bias.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You might get a seat at the table but you also might end up lending
your reputation to a cause you don&amp;#39;t believe in.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Evaluate teachers like they do in the real world</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/evaluating-teachers/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 19 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/evaluating-teachers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This old article has been reposted a few times in my circles over the
past few weeks &lt;a href=&#34;http://educationnext.org/facadeofexcellence/.&#34;&gt;http://educationnext.org/facadeofexcellence/.&lt;/a&gt; It&amp;#39;s from
2003 and complains about the lack of flexibility schools had back then
with regard to hiring and salary. The article is old and out of date
and the seniority system no longer holds for hiring but it does for
lay offs. The salary scale from back then, though, is still in place.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My friend Alex  asked my thought about how we might deal with evaluating
teacher quality. I thought I&amp;#39;d share them here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Alex listed a number of commonly tried and suggested options on
teacher evaluation and why they&amp;#39;re all flawed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven&amp;#39;t asked Alex&amp;#39;s permission so I won&amp;#39;t post his list and
comments here. Instead let&amp;#39;s start with the boogeyman those that attack public
education always trot out – tenure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s get a couple of things straight - tenure is not a job for
life. For K12 teachers, it&amp;#39;s the right to due process. That means you
can&amp;#39;t be fired without cause.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I hear the free market capitalists out there already – &amp;#34;in the real
world, you&amp;#39;re an at will employee, why do teachers need this due
process?&amp;#34; - I&amp;#39;ll get to that down below. For now, let&amp;#39;s look at a few
points on tenure:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First - you can fire a tenured teacher, you just have to document your
case. This means that the supervisor has to actually do their job.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next - people can complain about rubber rooms and the time it takes to
fire one of these tenured teachers. That&amp;#39;s because the DOE won&amp;#39;t hire
sufficient hearing officers. In a recently resolved case, a friend of
mine - a terrific AP was finally returned to her post after she was
railroaded on false charges. She was in the rubber room for years. The
DOE kept delaying the process – all she wanted was to go to &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34;
since everyone knew she&amp;#39;d be exonerated - the fact that she was up on
charges at all speaks to why teachers need tenure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next - teachers don&amp;#39;t grant tenure, the administration does. Why are
all these horrible teachers being granted tenure? Stories abound of
administrators granting tenure to bad teachers so long as they
transfer to another school - who&amp;#39;s to blame here?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, the contract that establishes tenure is jointly negotiated
by the teachers union and the city - no one ever seems to complain
about the city.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next, let&amp;#39;s talk about bonuses and competition. People in the business
world take the false assumption that everyone thinks, acts, and feels like
they do. Here&amp;#39;s a surprising fact – teachers aren&amp;#39;t in it for the
money. Sure, we&amp;#39;d like to make a little more - perhaps enough to
actually  live in a decent apartment and not need a second job to make
ends meet -  but no one went into teaching to get rich. Teachers are in
it to uplift ALL their students and their school as a whole.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now let&amp;#39;s look at the model currently in vogue - value added
measures. Besides the fact that they&amp;#39;re arbitrary and don&amp;#39;t work (see
&lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-09-06-why_i_might_no_longer_be_an_effective_teacher.md/&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-10-25-effective-teacher-2.md/&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) they&amp;#39;re nothing like how people are evaluated
in the real world.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How are people evaluated in regular jobs? As far as I know, they&amp;#39;re
evaluated by their managers and bosses - possibly also by their peers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Funny thing - that&amp;#39;s how teachers used to be evaluated before all this
nonsense brought about by the &amp;#34;reformers.&amp;#34; Of course, no one will
admit to this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Did this system work? For the most part, but not entirely. Why were
there problems? Because, unlike a business, principals are not
necessarily incentivized to have the best teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Schools and principals are evaluated on ridiculous metrics - the same
standardized tests they use to evaluate teachers. To look at a small
piece – to graduate high school, kids need to pass at least one math
regents and pass three years of math classes. To be &amp;#34;college ready&amp;#34; a
student still only needs to pass one math regents and take at least
one year of geometry or trig.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This means that as far as math is concerned, a principal is
incentivized to have a math department that can get their kids through
the algebra regents. Here&amp;#39;s how this frequently plays out. The kids
take algebra over two years and then passes the exam. The kids take
geometry as their third year. They don&amp;#39;t have to pass the regents, but
it appears that in order to increase a student&amp;#39;s chances of passing
that exam, classes don&amp;#39;t teach proof - the most important and hardest
part of the class. Why not? Because it&amp;#39;s easier to pass the exam by
learning most of the other stuff.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here we have a school where the incentive is to hire teachers that can
teach to the algebra regents and that&amp;#39;s about it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s at a school with a low performing population. In a higher
performing school, the kids will do well on the standardized tests
regardless of teacher quality so there&amp;#39;s no incentive to hire the
best. Even if that&amp;#39;s what they want to do, there&amp;#39;s no way to know if
they&amp;#39;re actually doing it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back to why teachers need due process. Since principals aren&amp;#39;t held
accountable in any reasonable way, teachers can&amp;#39;t be. The end result
is that teachers are subject to abuses by principals. I myself was
once brought up on bogus charges raised by a principal (not a Stuy
one) who wanted to make trouble. Without due process, I would be out
of a job. So would many others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The answer? To me it&amp;#39;s figure out how to hold principals
accountable. In Alex&amp;#39;s Facebook post he  mentions evaluation by
college and workforce success but that has a slow feedback loop. The
truth is, education does have a slow feedback loop. Schools, however,
exist for along time and principals should have tenure periods of more than
just a couple of years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My feelings? Why not look at graduates succeeding in college or on the
tax rolls? This wouldn&amp;#39;t be perfect but it would be a start. While NY
can&amp;#39;t count on private universities sharing accurate information in a
timely manner there should be a way of tracking if a high school
graduate is enrolled in a SUNY or CUNY one, two, three, or four
semesters after graduation. Create a baseline for a school and start
from there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If principals were actually accountable in a reasonable
way they&amp;#39;d have incentive to have the best teachers. Then we can get
back to the old system which was indeed the way the &amp;#34;real world&amp;#34;
works.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Hunter CS is so important to NYC</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hunter-cs-important/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hunter-cs-important/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
If you know me you know that my morning reads include a visit over to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://avc.com&#34;&gt;avc.com&lt;/a&gt;, Today, &lt;a href=&#34;http://avc.com/2016/10/cranes/&#34;&gt;Fred&amp;#39;s post&lt;/a&gt; talked about development and progress,
evolution, if you would, in the city. Although not directly related,
it got me thinking about gentrification.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To me, gentrification all too often seems to result in pushing out
people and business that were there during the hard times.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We don&amp;#39;t need to force out long time residents that can no longer make
rent - we need to uplift communities with pathways to towards greater
economic opportunity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Those of us in CS Education, each in our own way, are trying to help
build those pathways.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Return readers know that I&amp;#39;ve ranted about some of the popular magic
bullets. I&amp;#39;ve periodically talked about my concerns over code schools
but even at their best they represent a workforce program for the well
to do. I&amp;#39;ve also talked about efforts like P-Tech which sound good,
but besides the fact that &lt;a href=&#34;https://garyrubinstein.wordpress.com/2016/10/06/p-tech-principal-responds/&#34;&gt;the emperor has no clothes&lt;/a&gt;, is the school
really preparing kids for opportunities in their own neighborhoods or
in data centers far from home?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are some workforce programs like &lt;a href=&#34;https://perscholas.org/&#34;&gt;Per Scholas&lt;/a&gt; that I really like
and respect but they&amp;#39;re limited in what they can do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What does that leave us with? The traditional path – college.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In terms of tech, New York City has some amazing colleges. You ask
most people, they&amp;#39;ll come back with NYU, Columbia. Great institutions
but &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; expensive.  Not everyone can afford $75,000 a year and
not everyone can afford to go into hundreds of thousands of debt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is why Hunter CS is so important. Actually CUNY but I can only
affect my little corner of the world.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hunter College has a really nice CS program and department. It&amp;#39;s small
and has flown under the radar but it&amp;#39;s one of the reasons I came over
to Hunter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of my responsibilities at Hunter is to develop our new honors CS
program and to connect all of  Hunter CS to the tech sector in NY.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven&amp;#39;t written much about what&amp;#39;s been going on but that will change
int the months to come. Suffice it to say that to uplift our
communities we need real, affordable educational opportunities and in
terms of tech, education that leads to real opportunities in
our city&amp;#39;s tech sector.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m convinced that Hunter College can be a game changer for the wealth
of young talent we have in New York and for our tech sector.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Computational Thinkers in Scotland</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/scotland/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/scotland/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m way behind on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://cacm.acm.org/&#34;&gt;Communications of the ACM&lt;/a&gt;. I generally only read
them when I use my trainer in the mornings and with summer running and
outside riding, I&amp;#39;m still on the December 2015 issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This morning, I read a viewpoint by Jeremy Scott and Alan Bundy on &lt;a href=&#34;http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/12/194638-creating-a-new-generation-of-computational-thinkers/abstract&#34;&gt;a
program in Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;#39;re an ACM member, and if you&amp;#39;re a CS
practitioner, student, academic, or teacher you should be, you can read the piece for details.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Me? I noticed a number of similarities between what Bundy and Scott
described and efforts here in the USA including some of the red flags.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not here to talk about the program described in detail or their
successes and failures. I don&amp;#39;t have enough information to fairly
comment on that. I&amp;#39;m here in my usual role of curmudgeon to highlight
common red flags that if unheeded could cost all of us the opportunity
to get really great CS Ed to all of our students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One red flag right away were a number of references to the program
being curriculum and materials driven, not teacher driven. The
viewpoint states that materials &amp;#34;were designed to be used by even
non-specialist teachers.&amp;#34; We see the same thing here in the USA and
not just in CS Ed. Teaching overall is being devalued with the elite
pushing programs that handcuff good teachers to a script (which leads
students towards &amp;#34;success&amp;#34; in passing a nonsense standardized exam)
all the while sending their own kids to elite private schools with
knowledgeable teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know i didn&amp;#39;t want my kids to be taught chemistry history or any
other subject by a teacher that hasn&amp;#39;t studied the content yet here we
go saying it&amp;#39;s okay for CS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The counter argument is that we have to do something now and we&amp;#39;ll do
better later. We all go in with the best of intentions but more often
than not, once a politician has their sound bite and once a cheap
apparent solution is in place, it&amp;#39;s good enough and we&amp;#39;re done. I
ranted about that a while back both &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-03-04-expedient-vs-good.html/#.V-5UqN9vGAk&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-07-learning-takes-time.html/#.V-5Uot9vGAk&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. To their credit,
Bundy and Scott talk a bit about this concern in the piece.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The piece also said &amp;#34;It is also necessary to employ a pedagogy that is
informed by the latest research into the most effective ways to teach
computing.&amp;#34; This sounds good but the truth is, education research
doesn&amp;#39;t have the best reputation among educators. Last month, I
asked one of the best math teachers around what was being bandied
about as best practices in math education according to &amp;#34;the
research?&amp;#34; He basically said &amp;#34;the research says do &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fad du jour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
but that doesn&amp;#39;t work for me so I just do &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;actually good technique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over the years, I&amp;#39;ve spoken to many teachers and by and large the best
ones discredit &amp;#34;the research.&amp;#34; Of course, my comment will be
discredited by ed researchers saying that &amp;#34;you&amp;#39;re just giving
anecdotes&amp;#34; but then, if I did the same thing while employed as a
researcher, did a couple of surveys and submitted it for publication,
then it would be &amp;#34;research.&amp;#34; So much of teaching is a craft and the
truth is, practitioners know best.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Related to this is authentication by citing authority. Particularly
dangerous in our field because many people with little to no real
background in teaching CS are anointed as experts and thought leaders
(see this post: &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-10-26-self-appointed-experts.html/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). In this case, the viewpoint cites Cameron
Fadjo. I&amp;#39;ve only met Cameron once or twice and he seems like a sharp
guy but when he was given the post of Director of Software Engineering
for NYC, according to his linked in profile, he had neither taught k12
nor had any real CS background.  This is of course the profile of many
CS Education thought leaders.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My overall take. It sounds like just like here, Scotland has people
trying to make a difference and trying to do good. It also sounds like
they&amp;#39;re falling into the same traps and pitfalls as we are on this
side of the Atlantic.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Federal Aid for Code Schools - is this a good thing?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/fed-aid-for-code-schools/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/fed-aid-for-code-schools/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I saw this headline earlier today: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/coding-bootcamps-just-got-a-big-boost.html&#34;&gt;The U.S. Just Made a Bold Move to Improve Diversity in Tech&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The article talks about a program by which a number of code schools
will be able to accept federal student aid. I don&amp;#39;t know if we&amp;#39;re
talking student loans or  grants but I&amp;#39;m not sure it matters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The headline sounds great. I&amp;#39;m not so sure that this is a good thing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My thinking&amp;#39;s evolved over the years but right now, everything tells
me that public funds and for profit education don&amp;#39;t mix.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What we, more often than not, end up with is a cash cow for a private concern.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Example one: The edTPA - a required exam for teacher licensing, at
least in NY. Prospective teachers pay hundreds of dollars to pass this
gatekeeper. Pearson, a private company (and not even an American one)
is essentially in charge of teacher licensing. They make the
assessments, they grade them, they decide who passes. A foreign
company is deciding who teaches our kids and at great expense to those
prospective teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;d be much better off going back to the old days. To become a
teacher, you had to pass through &amp;#34;The board of examiners.&amp;#34; Basically,
to get your permanent license you had to do an oral defense. Teachers
would be placed in a room of principals, supervisors, and master
teachers for an open grilling. It was cheaper and MUCH more
effective.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Example two: The PSAT 8/9, PSAT, and SAT. These are exams that tell us
one thing: how kids will do on future PSAT and SAT tests. They&amp;#39;re not
good predictors of college success but the college board (a non-profit
in name only) has convinced us, or at least &amp;#34;convinced&amp;#34; our
politicians of the exams importance. So, rather than having
individuals make a choice as to whether or not to take these exams, NY
forks over who knows how much money per year so that our kids can take
a test with the belief that the exam will mystically make them college
ready. To make matters worse, students lose a day of instruction and
teachers have to proctor the exam instead of teaching.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Example three: Common core tests. Made in secret, graded in secret
with cut off scores designed after the fact. Absolutely no educational
value but once again, public funds flow freely into testing companies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problem is that these private concerns never really have to show
results and they&amp;#39;re never held accountable and since the money we pay
them is hidden in city and state budgets, the taxpayer is none the wiser.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what about code schools?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In a similar vein, money will flow from the government to the code
schools. The question is, do they really have the secret sauce.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have lots of friends who run and work in code schools and have met
many more. Some code schools are trying to really educate and some
not so much. In any case, let&amp;#39;s take a look.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You frequently hear about the success stories but for every one of
those, you can also find a manager talking about the fact that the
code school graduate can&amp;#39;t do anything other than ape the narrow tool
that they were exposed to in the three or so months at the code
school. So, the truth is that results are probably a mixed bag.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is this good? Well, when you consider the typical code school MO it
really isn&amp;#39;t.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To attend a for profit code school you have to not only afford the
tuition but also be able to sustain yourself for the duration of the
program. That makes most code schools options for the well to do -
those already well positioned for success.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then they make the candidates go through pre-work – frequently online
course work. So, before you even step into a code school, they know
you&amp;#39;re likely going to succeed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once in, they train the candidates in a narrow slice of tech. I&amp;#39;ve
talked to a number of code school leaders about that. I&amp;#39;ve asked how
well the kids would be able to adapt given the constraints of their 3
month or so training. The typical answer was that the candidate could
just re-up and pay again to learn the next limited time only skill.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Should taxpayer dollars go to this? Probably not. There&amp;#39;s no
indication that code schools can provide meaningful long lasting
education to even those who are best prepared to learn on their
own. Whats&amp;#39; more, we haven&amp;#39;t seen evidence that they have the answers
for the under-served. Combine that with government&amp;#39;s history of not
keeping an eye on and not holding accountable private education
providers, I think we&amp;#39;re just setting up a new line of corporate
welfare that will, on the surface help some but it is in no way the
answer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Too often public/private means that the private entity gets the money
and the public gets stuck holding the bag. Better would be to have
tech companies foot the bill. Some coding schools already do
this. Tech companies that are happy with coding school graduates can
finance the program.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What we should be doing is focusing on things like community
colleges. Organizations that are supposed to be real, long term,
community centers. With moderate tweaking, there&amp;#39;s no reason why a
community college, not to mention 4 year schools, couldn&amp;#39;t provide far
superior preparation than even the best code school.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ed Disruption - why it&#39;s different</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ed-disrupt-why-diff/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ed-disrupt-why-diff/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Earlier today I read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eliothorowitz.com/blog/2016/07/25/innovate-vs-appropriate/&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/eliothorowitz&#34;&gt;Eliot Horowitz&lt;/a&gt;, founder and CTO of MongoDB.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Eliot titled the post &amp;#34;Innovate vs Appropriate&amp;#34; and talks about the
importance of knowing when to come up with something new vs when to
use the accepted tool, technique, or method. Eliot, of course is
discussing this as it applies to MongoDB and it&amp;#39;s well worth a read
but it got me thinking about the ever popular need to &amp;#34;disrupt&amp;#34;
education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve witnessed this disruption or Ed Reform for the last decade
plus. The basic notion that public education isn&amp;#39;t working so we need
to disrupt things. We&amp;#39;ve suffered through:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Vouchers
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Charters
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Online &amp;#34;learning&amp;#34; replacing teachers
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teach for America and other temp type efforts
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Merit pay
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
VAM for teacher evaluation
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and more
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These disruptions are brought to you by your friendly neighborhood
billionaire &amp;#34;philanthropist&amp;#34; or your politicians.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By and large, they haven&amp;#39;t worked.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bill Gates got us to close down community schools and create small
ones. While we did need more small schools, overall it didn&amp;#39;t work
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marc-epstein/small-schools-miracle-or_b_2641400.html?utm_hp_ref=new-york&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/06/09/how-much-bill-gatess-disappointing-small-schools-effort-really-cost/%0A&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). VAM teacher evaluation is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/06/09/how-much-bill-gatess-disappointing-small-schools-effort-really-cost/%0A&#34;&gt;arbitrary and capricious&lt;/a&gt;,
merit pay has &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/ravitch-why-merit-pay-for-teachers-doesnt-work/2011/03/29/AFn5w9yB_blog.html&#34;&gt;never worked&lt;/a&gt;, nor does the &lt;a href=&#34;http://educationnext.org/online-charters-mostly-dont-work-forum-virtual-schools-greg-richmond/&#34;&gt;online thing&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, charter
schools by and large &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nea.org/home/32999.htm&#34;&gt;don&amp;#39;t do better&lt;/a&gt; than public schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rather than saving our schools, these efforts have lowered teacher
morale and done little for our most vulnerable children.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what&amp;#39;s the difference between ed disruption and the tech world?
Well, for starters, those disrupting education totally ignore the very
advice that Eliot posted about today.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Disruption to and of our public schools hasn&amp;#39;t been a matter
appropriating what works and innovating what needs to be innovated but rather
a playground for pet projects of politicians and well meaning rich
folk.  Rather than looking at something simple that works, like, say,
smaller class sizes, we get computerized testing. Instead of
experienced teachers, we get inexperienced newbies that leave after
their commitment is up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why the difference? It hit me while reading Eliot&amp;#39;s post. When a
founder is &amp;#34;disrupting&amp;#34; he has skin in the game - it&amp;#39;s his company -
sink or swim. Not so for education reformers. Politicians merely need
to be re-elected.Sso as long as something looks good short term, it is
good. Those who disrupt schools are never held accountable. We got
small schools and VAM from among other places, Bill Gates. He admitted
his reforms didn&amp;#39;t work but was there any penalty for disrupting so
many lives? Nope. For politicians, it&amp;#39;s the same story. As Mayor Mike
Bloomberg once said &amp;#34;If they don&amp;#39;t like my education policy, they can
boo me at parades.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Can we fix this? Sure, but not unless those forcing the changes have
real skin in the game. Will it happen? I&amp;#39;m not holding my breath.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hillary and Student Loans</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hillary-loans/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hillary-loans/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday I read over Hillary&amp;#39;s briefing on her initiative on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2016/06/27/hillary-clintons-initiative-on-technology-innovation/&#34;&gt;Technology and Innovation&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A lot of it sounds good but, at least for the education piece, I have
my doubts. My feeling is that she&amp;#39;s pretty much aligned with the
current administration education wise and the current administration
has been as bad if not worse than the previous with respect to public
education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I have issues with some of the education pieces and very much
like some of the others, I don&amp;#39;t want to get into that today. I want
to focus on one specific part of her plan. The part that defers
college debt for up to 3 years for founders and entrepreneurs. This
sounds great but is this really a good thing?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some initial responses from the education community is &amp;#34;what about
young teachers, don&amp;#39;t they deserve some help on college debt? What
about nurses?…&amp;#34; and of course they&amp;#39;re right. On the other hand, I
don&amp;#39;t want people to go into teaching for 2 or 3 years just to get
some debt relief benefit and then jump ship. That&amp;#39;s the Teach for
America model that I feel has become so harmful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But again, that&amp;#39;s not where I&amp;#39;m going with this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s start with &amp;#34;who are these founders?&amp;#34; I don&amp;#39;t have any hard data
but I have read a couple of recent pieces that indicate that founders
right out of college are typically from well to do backgrounds. This
of course makes sense. A kid up to his or her eyes in debt from a poor
background. No savings, no property, likely a family, that is siblings
and parents who are also treading water can ill afford to take a big
financial risk. A kid from a monied family? Much more so.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This alone makes Hillary&amp;#39;s plan a boon for the wealthy but not so
much for the people we need to give a hand up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next, this plan talks about the founders and only says it will
&amp;#34;explore similar incentives&amp;#34;  for early employees, citing &amp;#34;10 to 20.&amp;#34;
This doesn&amp;#39;t seem right to me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now let&amp;#39;s look further into the benefits. I don&amp;#39;t know what the
success and failure rates are for startups. I&amp;#39;ve seen a bunch of
figures including:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
90% of startups fail within the first three years
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Three out of four startups fail
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of 10 startups, 3 or 4 totally fail, 3 or 4 break even and the
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
others turn a profit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know where the truth lies but I&amp;#39;d imagine that the success
rate for startup by a recent college graduate, wet behind the ears is
probably higher than for a more season professionals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hillary&amp;#39;s plan defers debt for up to three years. If any of the
failure numbers cited above are near correct it means that these kids
will have burned through up to three years with the experience of a
failed startup to show for it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve always advised my students, all things being equal, start at a
big or mid size company, develop your chops, learn how they do it,
further build out your network, and then go out and do your
thing. Most kids are better served not going directly from college to
their first startup.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So there it is. A plan that makes for great &amp;#34;press release&amp;#34; but is it
really addressing the issues?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PDF 2016 - How we lost the open web</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/pdf2016-lost-in-the-silo/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/pdf2016-lost-in-the-silo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I spent the last couple of days attending &lt;a href=&#34;http://go.personaldemocracy.com/&#34;&gt;Personal Democracy Forum
2016&lt;/a&gt;, described on their landing site as:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The world’s leading conference exploring and analyzing technology&amp;#39;s
impact on politics, government, and society.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s the reason why I haven&amp;#39;t posted my latest Emacs video.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
PDF is a great conference and raised a huge number of important
issues. I&amp;#39;ll probably blog about a few over the next few weeks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One topic that I&amp;#39;ve already lamented about has been the way we as a
society are allowing so much information to be silo-ed in platforms
like Facebook.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I use Facebook as much as the next guy but it always irks me when I
see a CS Education post followed by rich discussion hidden within
Facebook&amp;#39;s walls and not available for discovery to the outside world
and the future.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I generally don&amp;#39;t get a lot of comments on my posts, but when I do,
more appear in the Facebook link to my post rather than publicly on
the post itself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the conference, we watched a video by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hossein_Derakhshan&#34;&gt;Hossein Derakhshan&lt;/a&gt; which
talked about the direction the web is moving in and the red flags it
should raise with all of us. He echoed my concerns and beyond but in a much more
eloquent way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m urging you to take the less than ten minutes to watch this
video. I know school&amp;#39;s winding down for all of us but for those of you
who are teachers out there - share this with your students. I&amp;#39;m sure a
rich discussion will follow.

      <title>Navajo Math Circles</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/navajo-circles/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/navajo-circles/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, I saw the New York Premiere of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zalafilms.com/navajo/&#34;&gt;Navajo Math Circles&lt;/a&gt;, a
documentary on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mathcircles.org/&#34;&gt;Math Circle&lt;/a&gt; put in place to support and enrich the
currently under-served community in the Navajo educational system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At their core, Math Circles are math outreach and enrichment
programs. I&amp;#39;m most familiar with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nymathcircle.org/&#34;&gt;New York Math Circle&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m friends
with many of their teachers and organizers and my son took part in
their summer program for a couple of years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over in the southwest, these Math Circles have been bringing together
students, frequently across great distances each day to explore
problem solving and creativity through mathematics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As someone who&amp;#39;s worked hard to bring educational opportunities to the
have nots, I love the program. Some of the highlights include the kids
working on open ended problems, focusing on process and techniques
more than specific results, working both collaboratively but also
developing self sufficiency, and more. I also love the fact that
they&amp;#39;ve started teacher math circles to help to bring some of that
math circle magic to the everyday classroom.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I enjoyed the film and recommend you check it out to see what&amp;#39;s
possible and I want to share my two big takeaways.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, early on in the film, one of the people running the program
talked about developing a math enrichment program through and with
Navajo traditions and culture. This is HUGE and I feel it&amp;#39;s something
we&amp;#39;re losing. America is so diverse from coast to coast and here in
New York City you can see radically different ways of life living
right across the street from each other. Everyone pays lip service to
&amp;#34;making the work interesting and relevant to the student&amp;#34; but few
people walk the walk. These folk do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Second, I left the documentary with a sour taste in my mouth. Not
because of the program but because the Navajo Math Circle project and
projects like it are scraping together what little resources they can
to try to do what the school systems should be doing to begin with.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As we move to scripted lessons, national standards, curricula dictated
or at least influenced by large private concerns and standardized
tests, our schools are moving further and further away from community
and local culture.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the documentary, one student pointed out that in math class, they
have to use the textbook. They learn the process and then have to
solve the problems. In Math Circle, there are no textbooks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Afterwards, the students in from the Math Circle did some Q&amp;amp;A. I asked
them to elaborate - what&amp;#39;s the difference between there Math Circle
experiences and their in school ones. I got:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Math Circle is fun!!!!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think that says it all.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know many great teachers who try to bring culture and community to
their classes. One of my son&amp;#39;s best teachers, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.heinemann.com/authors/828.aspx&#34;&gt;Paula Rogovin&lt;/a&gt; did it all
the time. Many of my friends and colleagues try to do so as well but
the powers that be make it harder and harder.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Until we win back public education it&amp;#39;s important to support programs
like Math Circles (and, if I do say so myself, programs like our own
&lt;a href=&#34;http://cstuy.org&#34;&gt;CSTUY&lt;/a&gt;) and it&amp;#39;s also critical that we work to try to bring community
and culture to our regular classes.
&lt;/p&gt;

I haven&amp;#39;t been teaching this past semester. That&amp;#39;s why I haven&amp;#39;t been
writing much about lessons. I miss working with students but that will
resume in the fall and this semester has allowed me to get a jump on
new projects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s also allowed me to look at some student issues from a bit of a
distance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One issue that keeps coming up is cheating.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some of it, classroom cheating. my friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cscheerleader&#34;&gt;Ria&lt;/a&gt; recently asked a
question on Facebook about it. A nice thread ensued but unfortunately,
it&amp;#39;s locked in the Facebook silo. I&amp;#39;ve got a lot to say on that and
hope to explore it soon but today let&amp;#39;s focus on project
cheating - something that could just as easily apply to homeworks and
student essays and research papers as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One part of the question is on students using code they find out in
the wild. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alfredtwo&#34;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; wrote a bit about it on his blog &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2016/05/copying-codesteal-from-best.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; where he points
out some pluses, some minuses, and raises some good thought points.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I want to keep it in the class - code sharing amongst students,
project and source code submission, and group projects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teachers have all sorts of options these days including:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using a CMS like Blackboard or Moodle
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dropbox based solutions
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Emailing projects
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using development tools and sites such as git with GitHub, BitBucket
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
or other repository hosting services
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve always been a fan of having the kids learn real software
engineering skills along with the CS so Git, GitHub and public repos
have been my weapon of choice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Interesting enough, I&amp;#39;ve gotten an earful both from fellow teachers
and professors and online for my stance on public repos.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I keep hearing &amp;#34;the kids will copy from each other&amp;#34; or something like
that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As Alfred said in his post: &amp;#34;Students have been copying from
classmates for years.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Students who want to copy assignments have done so long before we&amp;#39;ve
been teaching CS and they&amp;#39;ll be doing it for years to come.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using a hidden submission system doesn&amp;#39;t help and could hurt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Far better to create an open environment. You get an opportunity to
talk about code sharing, attribution, learning from each other,
supporting each other, and where to draw the line.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On top of that, the students learn a real tool set and have a chance
to learn real development methodologies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s a win all around.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Will open repos stop cheating and irresponsible copying? Certainly
not. It could, however, raise awareness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So what do I do on the cheating front?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Besides trying to create a culture where cheating is discouraged,
cooperation is encouraged but where students know the line, I will try
to keep them honest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Frequently, the day a big project is due, I&amp;#39;ll give a quiz on the
project. Students will have to describe parts of the project and what
they did. Either a student will have had to contributed or at least
will have had to have studied the rest of the teams code to pass the
quiz.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
GitHub also gives tools that help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s the GitHub graph for a project:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/github-graph.png&#34; alt=&#34;/img/github-graph.png&#34; title=&#34;/img/github-graph.png&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can see who did what and when. The teacher can drill down further
to examine the diffs – what code did each student write, when, and
from where. If two students submit very similar code, the commit
timestamps will even tell you who was first.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The tooling for teachers could be better but the infrastructure is
there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Technology isn&amp;#39;t going to prevent cheating and more often than not, it
seems that measures taken don&amp;#39;t stop the bad guys but inconvenience
those trying to do it right.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Much better to build a class culture where the kids want to do it the
right way.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A World Without Advanced Placement</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/world-without-ap/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/world-without-ap/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Some good points in the Facebook comments on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ap-we-dont-trust-teachers/#.Vy5aAd9vH0o&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;. One notable
comment was the fact that many teachers wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to gain the
traction needed to teach CS without an AP designation. This is true
but also sad that we&amp;#39;ve awarded such educational authority to a
private company that&amp;#39;s accountable to no one. Schools should run
courses because they&amp;#39;re good for kids not specifically because they&amp;#39;re
AP.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stuyvesant just implemented a policy that every student has to take at
least one AP class to graduate and that now every student in an AP
class has to take the AP exam. There&amp;#39;s also been a push for Stuy to
run APCS Principles in spite of the fact that the current home grown
intro course is superior.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These policies and pushes at Stuy are purely for the sake of ratings
and in no way for the benefit of the student.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But let&amp;#39;s imagine a world without the college board.  To do this we&amp;#39;re
going to have to take off our computer science hats and look at
another, more established high school subject area - mathematics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, setting the stage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s the mid 1990&amp;#39;s. High school students across the nation are taking
math classes. Some are even taking calculus. This makes the College
Board happy since they offer two AP Calculus exams. But the College
Board notices that many students aren&amp;#39;t ready for calculus. To fill
this gap, they create &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Statistics&#34;&gt;AP Statistics&lt;/a&gt;. First offered in 1997 to 7,667
students it was given to almost 200,000 students last year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
According to wikipedia, the course was created to give an AP
mathematics option for students not ready for calculus.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t seem to recall any huge demand for an AP statistics course but
it was created and adopted. It turned into one of the fastest growing
AP classes and a nice money maker for the college board. I don&amp;#39;t know
how the class was pushed or perceived in other schools but at Stuy it
was seen as a way to get an easy AP math course on the
transcript. Before any statisticians get the torches and pitchforks -
I&amp;#39;m just relaying the student perception. I haven&amp;#39;t looked into the
course sufficiently to form an opinion on it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, let&amp;#39;s imagine a world without the College Board.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An individual school would look at it&amp;#39;s students needs and decide if
they needed an additional math course. Maybe they&amp;#39;d conclude that what they
were doing was fine or maybe they would conclude that a new class was
needed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If they decided they needed a new advanced course the school would
either have the expertise to create it in house or they&amp;#39;d probably
turn to the local college or university for guidance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They might end up with a course very similar to AP Statistics or they
might end up with something very different. They might
end up with another class like Discrete Math or they might end up
partnering with the college and having students take classes there. In
all cases, since math teachers generally have a pretty good math
backgroud, schools could make good decisions and design sound
educational experiences for their kids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of these seem to be better results for the students than blindly
following the College Board - keeping
education and education decisions local.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about CS?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I admit that&amp;#39;s a tougher nut to crack.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most schools generally don&amp;#39;t currently have the in house expertise
needed to build their own solutions or even to really critically judge
what&amp;#39;s out there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That said, even if you need join the cult of the College Board to get
your school to run some CS you can:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Grab all the materials you can find - those labeled AP and those not
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
labeled AP.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Don&amp;#39;t bother with AP Syllabus certification. Teach what you think is
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
best. Designate the class as honors to differentiate them from other
classes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Engage with your local college and tech sector. They&amp;#39;re not high
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
school educators but they are valuable resources.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unrelated side note - be wary of code schools - most don&amp;#39;t really
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
have any educational chops.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Don&amp;#39;t force kids to sit for the exams and only encourage them to do
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
so if the exam will likely do something for the kid.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think that&amp;#39;s it or my College Board rants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then again, I also thought that when I wrote Friday&amp;#39;s post.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advanced Placement - Because We Don&#39;t Trust Teachers</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ap-we-dont-trust-teachers/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ap-we-dont-trust-teachers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/college-board/&#34;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I ranted on about the College Board. This led to a Facebook
hosted discussion which got me thinking a little more:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Advanced Placement exams basically exist because we don&amp;#39;t trust our
high school teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I usually use phrases like &amp;#34;society doesn&amp;#39;t trust&amp;#34; but let&amp;#39;s
personalize it this time – for parents, think about whether or not you trust your
kids teachers? Do you a large private, unaccountable organization
more?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you teach an advanced placement course, in order for your class to
be listed as AP you have to submit your syllabus to the college board
for approval. This sounds like they&amp;#39;re setting a standard but it&amp;#39;s
not. I can point to a bunch of teachers who have submitted identical syllabi
where sometimes it&amp;#39;s accepted but ofttimes it&amp;#39;s rejected. This is the
syllabus we submitted originally for Stuy. Yes, we have high achieving
kids, but given the fact that the syllabus was approved originally and
that Stuy students just about all score 4 or 5 on APCS-A should tell
you something about the level of care or competence of the College
Board.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then you teach the class and in May, one to two months before the end
of the semester the kids take the AP exam - you don&amp;#39;t see results
until the summer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In theory, if the kids do well they can receive placement or
credit. The problem is, fewer and fewer schools are giving credit,
when they do, it might not help due to the way undergrads pay for
courses and placement can generally be achieved by appealing to
college departments or by taking college administered placements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back to the trust thing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In college, you take a course, the final exam is created by the
professor or a group of professors and it&amp;#39;s graded by the people that
teach the course - possibly as a committee. Kids final grades include
these exams but a student can fail a final or even miss one and still
pass the class whereas an AP exam is a one shot deal and even if you
&amp;#34;pass&amp;#34; you might not get anything from it. I&amp;#39;m not even getting into
questioning the quality and content of the exams.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kids get their grades and college credit. There are no outside
&amp;#34;standardized exams&amp;#34; and we trust that the professors and the colleges
are educating our kids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, in high school, teachers make their lessons, teach their classes,
create, administer, and grade final exams and kids get grade - but not
for college level classes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know multiple high school physics, chemistry, math, and computer
science teachers who are far better at teaching than their college
counterparts yet my friend the math teacher isn&amp;#39;t trusted to assess
his calculus students for the purpose of college credit - we don&amp;#39;t
trust him but we trust the faceless entity known as the College
Board.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Think about that for a minute.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You trust your child&amp;#39;s teacher with your child&amp;#39;s well being every
day but you don&amp;#39;t trust him to say whether or not your kid knows
calculus?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a real problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have a friend who frequently doesn&amp;#39;t quite finish the BC Calculus
test topics because he actually teaches the material in depth –
instead of &amp;#34;follow the scripts&amp;#34; the kids go through proofs and
derivations. It costs the kids - I know a number of them who got a 4
on the BC exam rather than a 5 but come the end of June when the class
is done, they know more calculus more deeply than a lot of kids who&amp;#39;ve
taken the class in college.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The lines of college have been blurred with more and more &amp;#34;remedial&amp;#34;
classes being taught at the college level and more and more &amp;#34;college
level&amp;#34; being taught in the high schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s a really sad state of affairs when we trust our professors - many
of whom are hired more for research than for their teaching chops
and we don&amp;#39;t trust our teachers during our kids more formative years.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>As curricula changes, what&#39;s falling through the cracks?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/semaphores/</link>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Edit:
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just a brief note to clarify a couple of things. As indicated in the
comments, this post isn&amp;#39;t  about what&amp;#39;s appropriate for HS CS. It&amp;#39;s
more about what kids have after they finish their education - be it
high school, college, code school, or other.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some of my thoughts are the results of pondering on the exacerbations
of friends after interviewing people for entry level positions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The two examples are just to illustrate the point.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Original Post:
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I enjoy reading blogs. It&amp;#39;s one of the ways I keep current. Not only
in terms of what&amp;#39;s going on in CS Education, but also trends in CS -
academic or professional as well as on a range of other topics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the blogs I enjoy is authored by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/b0rk&#34;&gt;Julia Evans&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;#39;t know
Julia, but we do have some mutual friends. I&amp;#39;ve enjoyed her &lt;a href=&#34;http://jvns.ca&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. She
does a nice job talking about any number of systems related
issue. I&amp;#39;ve tried to leave comments a few times but for some reason,
my comments always end up deleted or otherwise not showing up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One recent post, one on &lt;a href=&#34;http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/03/29/thread-pools-part-ii-i-love-blocking/&#34;&gt;concurrency&lt;/a&gt; got me thinking. Since the comment
I left there didn&amp;#39;t take, I thought I&amp;#39;d write about it here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s a nice post but the thing that caught my eye was when Julia
said that she &amp;#34; didn&amp;#39;t know what a semaphore was until I read this
code and I was like OH THIS IS AMAZING AND SO USEFUL AND WOW.&amp;#34; I was a
little surprised, semaphores seem to be one of those basic concepts
that you just know but that is, of course incorrect. I first learned
about semaphores in my honors Systems class with my mentor, the late
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Dewar&#34;&gt;Robert Dewar&lt;/a&gt;. We started from test and set and worked our way up. I
had two other undergraduate classes that at least mentioned the topic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then again, I knew that many undergrads would never get a good
treatment of concurrency so I tried to build a bit in to the System
Level Programming  course I designed while at Stuy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This got me thinking - according to her linked in, Julia was a CS
major at McGill - a university that I hold in high regard but either
semaphores were never covered or their treatment didn&amp;#39;t make enough of
an impact to be worth remembering. What topics do we cover in our
classes that kids just let fall to the wayside and what topics do we
end up losing as curricula change and we don&amp;#39;t have an eye on the big
picture.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One big one is memory management. When APCS and college 101 classes
went to Java, memory management went out the window. Not a problem, as
long as memory issues are covered in some other course. Unfortunately
the don&amp;#39;t seem to be. You can make a case that kids don&amp;#39;t need to
understand memory management or anything about garbage collection but
I&amp;#39;d argue that while one might never have to do their own memory
management a good CS person should have some understanding of what&amp;#39;s
going on under the hood or as my friend Gerry says &amp;#34;never use a
technology you couldn&amp;#39;t write yourself.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another biggie that I lived through was the IBM PC era. Prior to the
mid to late 80&amp;#39;s when the IBM PC ruled the world, kids learned about
CS on timesharing systems. Once the PC took hold, every kid learning
programming or studying CS was working on their own machine. They had
full access to everything and the machine just supported a single
thread.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the one hand, it was nice since you could easily play with low
level programming and hardware but on the other hand, a hole
generation didn&amp;#39;t learn about the complexities of multiple users and
multiple processes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Early in my career I designed courses and only later did I realize
that you can&amp;#39;t just design a course, you have to look at the full arc
of a students education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think it&amp;#39;s interesting to think about what concepts are getting left
on the side of the road and I wonder if the big players driving CS
education spend any time thinking about this bigger picture.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NYC DOE - Doing what it can to keep opportunities away from kids</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cstuy-coi/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cstuy-coi/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
The difficulties I&amp;#39;ve had with the city and DOE are pretty well
documented by now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today I&amp;#39;m going to tell you about my latest dealings with DOE and how
they prevented my team from bringing free quality CS education to city
students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
CSTUY&amp;#39;s not running SHIP, its summer program this year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s not something I&amp;#39;m happy about but part of me knew it might
happen. What did surprise me, although it shouldn&amp;#39;t have, was the role that
the NYC DOE played in preventing it from happening.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The bottom line initial reason for us not running SHIP this summer
was my time. Moving over to my new position at Hunter has
been terrific but I haven&amp;#39;t had the time needed for adequate
fundraising and outreach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I recently talked a bit about the difficulties we&amp;#39;ve had with
fundraising as compared to the &amp;#34;chosen programs&amp;#34; in
&lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-04-10-thought-leaders/#.VyKAnh9vH0o&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve also written a bit about related issues in these posts:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event, we weren&amp;#39;t going to be able to run this summer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I spoke to the team, Sam asked, &amp;#34;if we can keep the budget down
and figure out how to not be dependent on fundraising and outreach, can
we do something?&amp;#34; I told him, I&amp;#39;d love to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He came up with a plan. Instead of a full day program, we&amp;#39;d run half
day - this means fewer staff hours and no lunch. If we could run it at
Stuyvesant, in the computer labs (which already run Linux), we
wouldn&amp;#39;t have to worry about equipment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Under this plan, additional fundraising wasn&amp;#39;t needed, in fact, kids
could attend free of charge.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In terms of outreach, since we already had sufficient funds, even if
we only got returning shipmates and a few from word of mouth we&amp;#39;d be
ok and if we could cast a wider net, so much the better.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Oh, and the plan was for me to take the summer off. I&amp;#39;d help with
initial organization but I wouldn&amp;#39;t actually work the summer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, to summarize:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Free for the kids
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not involved and receive no compensation for the summer (this is
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
important for later)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My teachers would be paid for teaching in the program and CSTUY
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
would supply the funds to pay them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We floated the idea to Stuyvesant&amp;#39;s principal figuring that since
the teaching staff is from there and some of the kids tat would
benefit are Stuy students it wouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem. She said she loved
the idea but had to send it off to the conflict of interests people.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You see, it&amp;#39;s very important that teachers and former teachers don&amp;#39;t
actually benefit from working extra – it&amp;#39;s critical that teachers be
kept down.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Long story short - the teachers could work the program but aren&amp;#39;t
allowed to run it. They can come in and teach but can&amp;#39;t talk to the
principal about organizing it. For some reason, running a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
program for kids instead of relaxing over the summer means that the
teachers are getting this &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; benefit. Sure they&amp;#39;d be paid for
their time, but that seems fair.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As to me, I&amp;#39;m not allowed any dealings with the DOE for a year. Forget
the fact that I wanted to set this up while taking &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; pay so that
the kids wouldn&amp;#39;t be left without a program. Nope, that&amp;#39;s no good -
can&amp;#39;t have us bringing quality CS education to the kids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I dealt with these folks once before so I wasn&amp;#39;t really surprised.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A few years ago, a friend connected me with people at Amplify
to see about creating their APCS MOOC. We met a couple of times but
then the DOE people said I couldn&amp;#39;t work with them even though I was
just going to be working on the MOOC and not dealing directly with the
DOE in any way. I wasn&amp;#39;t negotiating contracts, making sales pitches,
or anything. I was just going to work on MOOC content.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It wasn&amp;#39;t like a certain NYC School&amp;#39;s Chancellor who had just left the DOE and
took the leadership position at Amplify. That wasn&amp;#39;t a conflict - I
guess it&amp;#39;s just important to keep the teachers in line - the rules
aren&amp;#39;t meant for the higher ups.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Funny side note – when I shared the fact that I couldn&amp;#39;t work for
Amplify with my friend, his first reaction was &amp;#34;because of the union?&amp;#34;
That seems to be the knee-jerk reaction from people in the business
world. Nope - the union was fine with it - it was the administration /
city. The city has done &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;far&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; more harm to the public schools than
the union ever could. Pretty much all the union does is make sure the
city follows the jointly negotiated contract.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back to the story.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, we&amp;#39;re not allowed to use school space to bring free CS education
to kids this summer. Plenty of other organizations non-profit and
for-profit alike seem to have no problem bringing their programs into
the schools. I&amp;#39;m sure many are getting money for this, grant based or
otherwise. In all cases, I&amp;#39;d take my team and their program over what
the DOE is actually rolling out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is the type of thing makes me want to say to hell with DOE but,
unfortunately, they aren&amp;#39;t affected, it&amp;#39;s the kids that lose out.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Awards for Educators</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/awards/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/awards/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There are all sorts of awards for teachers. The Presidential awards,
NEA awards, National and State level awards, and more. There are also
awards and honors given in more narrow areas like NCTM for math and
our own ACM.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve haven&amp;#39;t won any and never expected to. I&amp;#39;ve never played well
with the establishment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s ok though. For every honoree that I can point to and say &amp;#34;there&amp;#39;s
a master teacher,&amp;#34; there are half a dozen who you look at just know
that it was more about politics and connections than about teaching
chops.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Like anyone else, though, I do like a pat on the back and it is nice
to get some confirmation that you&amp;#39;re having a positive effect on kids
lives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So what are my awards? Well, I received what I consider my highest
honor this past weekend. I was in Hot Springs Arkansas for Jen and
Marcel&amp;#39;s wedding.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was a great weekend with old friends and new celerbrating a
wonderful event and I couldn&amp;#39;t be happier for the couple.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a teacher, to be included in your former students life events is as
big as it gets. I can&amp;#39;t begin to say how honored I was to be included
in their day. Even more special, that Marcel&amp;#39;s brother Barnabas and
his wife Suki are my oldest couple - they started dating back in my
class back in the beginning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s not the first time I&amp;#39;ve been invited to former students
weddings. I&amp;#39;ve seen around a dozen or so of my students wed. Every
time it&amp;#39;s special, just as it&amp;#39;s special when a former student decides
to reach out to let me know how they&amp;#39;re doing or to reconnect in
general. When they elect to share part of their lives with me, it
tells me that I was at least a little bit of a force for good way back
when.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Become a CS Education Thought Leader - No Experience Needed</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-04-20-thought-leaders/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-04-20-thought-leaders/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
A few weeks ago, a friend asked if I knew any CS teachers that were
available to work this summer. At the time, I didn&amp;#39;t have anyone to
recommend. We were still up in the air on running CSTUY&amp;#39;s SHIP summer
immersion program.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We ultimately decided not to run SHIP this summer. Mostly due to the
fact that in my new position, I didn&amp;#39;t have the time to do the
necessary fund-raising and outreach. We&amp;#39;re continuing with our Saturday
program through mid May and plan to bring more opportunities to the
kids of New York City in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s not what I want to write about today. That summer program
looking for a teacher, let&amp;#39;s call it program X made me think about
many of the players driving K12 CS education both in NY and beyond.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It turns out, the people that were running program X didn&amp;#39;t have a
teacher, didn&amp;#39;t have curriculum or program, and in fact didn&amp;#39;t have
a plan. What they were able to do, however, was raise money.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a sore spot with me - for CSTUY, we run program to program and
for me, fund-raising is the hardest part. Here we have a program that
has no idea as to what they&amp;#39;re going to do or who&amp;#39;s going to do it and
they ended up with substantial capital to work this non-existent
program.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s a sore spot because I&amp;#39;ve seen it before and seen it over and
over. People with either little or no CS experience, little or no
teaching experience and frequently neither being anointed as thought
leaders in CS Education or at the very least, the people with the &amp;#34;hot
program.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve seen this in companies, non-profits, for-profits, and
government. Some of these groups and programs are now considered
undisputed leaders when, if you dig beneath the hype, they really
don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re doing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, there are some &amp;#34;thought leaders&amp;#34; who have been in the trenches
and know their stuff but they seem few and far between.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know that all of these people running these programs and being given
this platform to influence our young are well meaning and I welcome
everybody to the table but maybe, just maybe they should take a step
back and ask themselves - do they really know what they&amp;#39;re doing or
are the just experimenting with other peoples children.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>We&#39;re Number One!! We&#39;re Number One!!!</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-11-19-were-number-one/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I woke up this morning to an email from my principal &#34;Stuy is #1.&#34;
This followed a bunch of Facebook posts by friends and alums of a
similar vein.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It was all about a couple of reports, &lt;a href=&#34;https://k12.niche.com/rankings/public-high-schools/best-overall/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessinsider.com/best-public-high-schools-in-america-2015-11&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It turns out
Stuy is ranked #1. Woo Hoo. We&#39;re awesome.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, everyone whooping it up now was quick to say &#34;all those
rankings are meaningless&#34; back when US News and World report ranked
Stuy way down on their list.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We all know what makes a great school: great students. At least in
terms of perception. Look at most of these lists and they&#39;ll be
dominated by high schools that take in high performing students.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Truth be told, in many ways, Stuyvesant isn&#39;t a special place, but
more on that down below.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In terms of the ratings and rankings they&#39;re meaningless but in a way
dangerous. I see it at Stuy. Under the current administration AP is
the word of the day. It&#39;s all Advanced Placement all the time.  Why?
That&#39;s one of the ways to rise up in the rankings. So are the school
surveys which is why there&#39;s been more pressure to get those done.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My feelings? AP is all about making money for the College Board. I&#39;m
not a fan of &#34;early college,&#34; I&#39;m a fan of enrichment. I&#39;ve said it
many times - if a course is such that it can be mastered equally well
by a 15 year old in 10th grade as by a 19 or 20 year old in college,
well, it really isn&#39;t college level. High achieving, well prepared
high school kids can do college level work in 11th and 12th grades but
probably not in all subject areas. Sure they can memorize, ape, and
mimic, but the depth of knowledge won&#39;t be there. Regardless, we
should trust schools and teachers to do it right. Schools can roll out
rigorous courses as good or better than AP. There&#39;s no real need for
the College Board seal of approval. Look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alex-mallory/private-schools-ap-tests_b_823616.html&#34;&gt;Fieldston and other
private schools&lt;/a&gt; as examples.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We&#39;ve been teaching our own introductory CS class at Stuy for
years. The entire team knows that it&#39;s far superior, at least for our
students, than the new AP CS Principles course yet our principal keeps
pushing the AP course.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ve spoken to a number of administrators  from highly regarded schools
over the past couple of years and all are pushing test scores, AP
classes, and anything to get those rankings up.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, there&#39;s a movement to make Stuy a generic school that happens to
have high performing students which brings me back to are we number
one or indeed are we special?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It certainly has a couple of things going for it. Great kids and a
large size. The large size ensures lots of electives. Stuy is one of
the few schools with a robust set of humanities classes, stem classes,
multiple music groups, and more. That&#39;s important. When I sent my kids
to Stuy a big part of the decision was due to the fact that they&#39;d be
surrounded by smart kids whose interests range all over the place. The
kids come from all backgrounds. Also, my kids would be able to explore all
of their current interests and maybe even pick up some new ones.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
But then there&#39;s the other side. We have lots of electives and some
are great but then, some are lousy. Just like any other school we have
some amazing teachers and some garbage. For the most part, if you
switched Stuy&#39;s faculty and administration with another school, you
might lose a few special electives and gain a few different ones but
by and large people wouldn&#39;t notice the difference.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Regardless, Stuy and all similar institution should be charged with
something extra. We should be leaders in developing programs and
sharing them with other schools. We should be developing experiences
for our kids that are appropriate to their level of development, not
being happy with high regents scores or the fact that we had a bunch
of Intel semifinalists, many who probably would have accomplished
similar feats regardless of the school they attended.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Kowtowing to the rankings kills that possibility. To reach the top of
the charts you have to follow the book. If you want to lead, you have
to write the book.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It would be silly of me to judge my success by how many kids pass the
APCS exam. It&#39;s an easy test for them. I&#39;ve worked hard not to create
classes because I like them, but because they make sense for our
kids. They sequence appropriately, and they give the kids
opportunities and experiences that they wouldn&#39;t get had they not
attended Stuy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately, since the late 90&#39;s I haven&#39;t had the luxury of a
supportive administration that shared my vision. As the school and the
system moves more towards the rankings you&#39;re going to see educational
leaders more and more marginalized and finally eliminated.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, is Stuy number one and is it special? As long as it&#39;s given the
same type of kids it&#39;s had for the past 100 or so years, the kids will
do fine. Is it really special? Well, unless it starts really think
about what the kids need and deserve, maybe not so much.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interview questions and tests</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-11-04-tests-and-interviews/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-11-04-tests-and-interviews/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
The StuyCS Family mailing list was host to an interesting discussion
today. One of our younger members asked if the practice of giving
technical problems during an interview was going to follow him
throughout his career or if it goes away for more senior applicants.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
An interesting discussion followed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It reminded me of a time I was talking to a few senior engineers at a
large tech company. A couple of younger engineers were with us along
with a new hire. The youngsters started talking about the new hires
technical interview questions. One older engineer light heartedly
asked another &#34;I don&#39;t recall any tricky technical questions, how
about you?&#34; &#34;I don&#39;t recall any either&amp;#x2026;&#34; and on around the table.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course these senior engineers had track records that stretched for
miles.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I never liked those tech interview questions. If you just took
algorithms, you&#39;ve got an edge and it really seems to be more of a
test of &#34;have you seen this problem before&#34; rather than a true test of
ability.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I much prefer those few companies that give &#34;take home assignments&#34; or
use other ways to determine fit.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The tech interview reminds me of the pop quiz or a poorly designed
test. If you just ask the question that the kid doesn&#39;t get, the kid&#39;s
in trouble. A kid could know how to handle 90% of the work but if the
question is that last 10%, zero credit.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As teachers, we end up using many forms of assessment and try to
develop an overall picture of a student.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Companies should try to do the same.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why to companies still use these technical interview questions?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Quite simply because they can.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A company might miss out on a number of great candidates by using a
bad technical question but they will probably get at least a
reasonably strong hire that passes the test. For the company, mission
accomplished.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As teachers, we can&#39;t do that. I&#39;m not given a class of 32 kids and
asked to pull out a couple of software engineers. As teachers, we&#39;re
supposed to pull everyone along.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teachers - boy do we suck!!!!</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-11-03-teachers-suck/</link>

      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-11-03-teachers-suck/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-orgheadline1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;orgheadline1&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-orgheadline1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today was a &#34;professional development day.&#34; That means that instead of
teaching, we were supposed to work on our craft.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Rather than the normal nonsense - forcing CS teachers to sit through
common core math lectures or how to use the latest calculator, our
host principal, Randy Asher, of Brooklyn Tech let us do our thing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Basically, it was a bunch of CS teachers from two schools - Stuy and
Brooklyn Tech, talking shop for most of the day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Given the ridiculous &#34;professional development&#34; we&#39;re subject to weekly
at Stuy, it was a welcome change.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We talked about a number of issues:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&#34;org-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How difficult concepts like iteration can be to actually teach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How retention is a real issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we have to deal with a range of students with a range of
interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens when we have a kid who finds out they&#39;re less
interested in CS than they thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we create a comfortable setting for a diverse population.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and more.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I mean, really - all we do is talk about how hard it is to teach CS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-orgheadline2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;orgheadline2&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-orgheadline2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Contrast that with every after school, summer, drop in, coding school
and program. They seem to:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&#34;org-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teach kids to be software developers just like adults in the course
of a summer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teach kids how to make we apps in N weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave kids more prepared for the APCS A exam than kids to take the
course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solve the diversity problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Seeing how much and how well all these non-educators can do with kids
vs what we were talking about I can only conclude that us teacher folk
are pretty lousy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, us real teachers have to pay attention to to
little things like long term retention and success and can&#39;t just
parade out a few nice stories and outlier results.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Give me a real teacher any day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ve written a bit on my concerns with drop in programs before &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/2015/05/07/learning-takes-time.html#.VjlSyd8Sr0o&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/2015/08/17/setting-up-to-fail-cs.html#.VjlSsd8Sr0o&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/2015/10/12/nycda.html#.VjlSqd8Sr0o&#34;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I remember a few years ago I was talking to someone about all the CS
Ed hype we were seeing. We both noted that many of the people doing
the best work are so busy doing that work that they can&#39;t spare the
time to generate the hype.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was with a bunch of those people today.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
While looking over my tweet stream, I noticed this:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;RSVP today for the K-12 CS Education Panel, presented by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Uber&#34;&gt;@Uber&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/FlatironSchool&#34;&gt;@FlatironSchool&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/nVBbSbRn9d&#34;&gt;https://t.co/nVBbSbRn9d&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/NAxowSIfff&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/NAxowSIfff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Flatiron School (@FlatironSchool) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/FlatironSchool/status/658748945481474049&#34;&gt;October 26, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, on November 12, one can head over to Uber and listen to three
experts talk about K12 CS Education. To quote the landing page:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&#34;org-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we engage our students in CS, and train our teachers to teach it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the biggest obstacles to overcome?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the future of K-12 CS Education?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&#39;s working?`&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sound great.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The problem?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Who are these expert voices that we&#39;re supposed to be listening to.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The panel consists of three people: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=ADEAAACdvOoBuWtX0sqm4gkJmOZ0AxArrQJgvnQ&amp;amp;authType=OPENLINK&amp;amp;authToken=IPmC&amp;amp;locale=en_US&amp;amp;srchid=9425671445893373413&amp;amp;srchindex=1&amp;amp;srchtotal=1&amp;amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A9425671445893373413%2CVSRPtargetId%3A10337514%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary%2CVSRPnm%3Atrue%2CauthType%3AOPENLINK%0A&#34;&gt;Adam Enbar&lt;/a&gt; of Flatiron School,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=ADEAAARHMgcBmb0ZqmtDHzi3b46_kZiEIL56VsQ&amp;amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;amp;authToken=uR-M&amp;amp;locale=en_US&amp;amp;srchid=9425671445893351065&amp;amp;srchindex=1&amp;amp;srchtotal=63&amp;amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A9425671445893351065%2CVSRPtargetId%3A71774727%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary%2CVSRPnm%3Atrue%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH%0A&#34;&gt;Rebecca Novak&lt;/a&gt; of ScriptEd, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=ADEAAAA2T2oBLc3-qal-_GfdMlMRdFEjP47jnOw&amp;amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;amp;authToken=4qXf&amp;amp;locale=en_US&amp;amp;srchid=9425671445893344587&amp;amp;srchindex=1&amp;amp;srchtotal=67&amp;amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A9425671445893344587%2CVSRPtargetId%3A3559274%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary%2CVSRPnm%3Atrue%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH%0A&#34;&gt;Debbie Marcus&lt;/a&gt;, the Executive Director
of CS Education for the New York City Department of Education.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sounds interesting.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a disclaimer, I have to say that I know Adam and Rebecca and
consider them friends. I like ScriptEd and what they do in the
schools. In fact, I think that my CSTUY programs are terrific next
steps for ScriptEd kids. ScriptEd is becoming good at what they do and
I think they&#39;re also aware of their limitations as an ed program. I
also know that Flatiron has done a solid job retraining adults for the
workforce. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever met Debbie Marcus. I also believe
all these people are well meaning.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What&#39;s the lay of the land?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Given her position, Ms. Marcus will be considered a voice of
authority and I can&#39;t seem to go to a CS Ed event without someone from
the Flatiron School or someone from ScriptEd there in a place
indicating that they should be considered an  authority on K12 CS
Education.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As much as I like what ScriptEd does in the schools and as much as the
Flatiron School has a strong reputation as an adult coding school
/ workforce program should these voices be the ones we&#39;re listening
to?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let&#39;s dig deeper.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Higher up in this post, I link to all three panelists LinkedIn
profiles. All three are conspicuously missing one thing - experience
in CS and Rebecca is the only one who&#39;s LinkedIn profile indicates any
time teaching.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, let&#39;s contrast that with the CSTUY and Stuy teams. Regular
readers know what I&#39;ve done building Stuyvesant&#39;s CS program and CSTUY
over the past 25 years and if you look at my team they all have
considerably more CS experience, Ed experience, and of course CS Ed
experience.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Who&#39;s driving the train?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Who&#39;s being excluded?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What&#39;s wrong with this picture.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alan Alda on Teaching Science</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-10-20-alda/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-10-20-alda/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Scale, scale, scale. Scripted lessons. Online resources, Moocs. No
excuses schools. All of these are modern trends in education. None of
these are about good education. It&#39;s really demoralizing reading
article after article devaluing true master teachers and real
education.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, last night was a real pleasure.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I attended a talk, given by Alan Alda on communicating science. The
talk was sponsored by &lt;a href=&#34;http://academyforteachers.org/&#34;&gt;The Academy for Teachers&lt;/a&gt;. I grew up watching
Hawkeye on MASH and more recently Arnold Vinick on The West Wing but
Mr. Alda has really been keeping himself busy in the world of
education. Check out what he&#39;s doing at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.centerforcommunicatingscience.org/&#34;&gt;Alan Alda Center for
Communicating Science&lt;/a&gt; at Stony Brook University.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At it&#39;s core, Mr. Alda&#39;s talk was about teaching. Making a connection
with your students and engaging them. The exact opposite of many of
the current ed reform trends.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Mr. Alda talked about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.centerforcommunicatingscience.org/the-flame-challenge-2/&#34;&gt;the Flame Challenge&lt;/a&gt; where he challenged
scientists to teach 11 year olds all about &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chemical_History_of_a_Candle&#34;&gt;a candle&lt;/a&gt; without dumbing it
down. Communication.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
He also talked about story telling. At one point he had a volunteer
from the audience carry a glass across the stage. He then had her do
it again, but this time with a full glass telling her &#34;if you spill a
drop everyone in your village will die.&#34; The difference in audience
attention was striking.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Mr. Alda also talked about using improvisational games to help
students open up as well as about &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge&#34;&gt;the curse of knowledge.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One of my favorite parts of the talk was when an audience member asked
for a few teaching tips. He replied that he hates tips because out of
context, without the connection to the class, they&#39;re
meaningless. Mr. Alda used as an example:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Imagine that you&#39;re about to give a piano recital at Carnegie Hall
and you asked for a few tips.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you&#39;ve never played before, those tips aren&#39;t going to help you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m asked for CS teaching tips all the time, and Mr. Alda very much
captured my feelings on the subject. My friend and Colleague Jim
Cocoros also captured the feeling when he reminded me that the only
&#34;tip&#34; he gives new teachers is &#34;be yourself.&#34; I couldn&#39;t agree more.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It was a delightful and a refreshing evening. I very much appreciate
and admire what Mr. Alda is doing beyond his acting and while I very
much hope he&#39;s able to extend his reach to more high school teachers
as he continues to work on communicating in science.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Grading Autograders</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-10-16-graders/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-10-16-graders/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The other day codehs made an announcement about their new
&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/codehs-product-updates/these-are-the-autograders-you-ve-been-looking-for-bda0fa8fd8a&#34;&gt;autograder&lt;/a&gt;. Fellow CS Teaching veteran Alfred Thompson had his say up
on his &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2015/10/autogradersfor-good-or-for-evil.html&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; where he talked about &lt;a href=&#34;https://computinged.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;Mark Guzdial&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s comment on
autograders leading to less creative assignments.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I very much agree that autograders, due to their rigidness lend
themselves to less creative projects, but thought I&#39;d write up a few
of my own thoughts on autograders.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
First and foremost, &lt;b&gt;I HATE GRADING&lt;/b&gt;. It&#39;s one of the worst parts of
my job and grading projects is &lt;b&gt;really&lt;/b&gt; hard to do well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You&#39;d think an autograder would be a panacea.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s not.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In addition to them being very nit-picky &amp;#x2013; got an extra space in your
output? &lt;b&gt;FAIL&lt;/b&gt;. Wrong number of significant digits? &lt;b&gt;FAIL&lt;/b&gt;. Didn&#39;t
handle all those &#34;trick&#34; cases? &lt;b&gt;FAIL&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Since autograders typically check your output against a correct
solution, it&#39;s going to be limited in what it can grade right and
wrong and what&#39;s more, it&#39;s very limited in the feedback it can give.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
These are some of the limitations that lead to less creative
projects but that&#39;s not my beef with the autograders.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why do we give assignments? To assess students? Yes, but also to
inform our instruction. We need to grade the assignments ourselves
because those assignments tell us about our students and teach us how
best to work with them. What&#39;s more, we really don&#39;t just want to see
that finished product, but rather, we want to see the process as
well. Autograders can&#39;t help here.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I do use autograders &amp;#x2013; &lt;a href=&#34;http://codingbat.com/&#34;&gt;codingbat.com&lt;/a&gt; and our own locally developed
&lt;a href=&#34;http://bert.stuy.edu/pbrooks/SchemingBat/scheming.py&#34;&gt;Scheming Bat.&lt;/a&gt; I use them for small homeworks and class assignments
early on. For bigger stuff, I do it myself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For advanced classes (AP and beyond) we&#39;re all about the GitHub. Not
only can I grab the projects at any time but I can also see how
projects were developed - logs, diffs, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vynl/vynl-v0/graphs/contributors&#34;&gt;graphs&lt;/a&gt;. All give me insight
into how the students working. Add in class lab time when I get to
interact with the kids and I&#39;ve got a good sense of my student
computer scientists.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In our intro courses, where they&#39;re not ready for GitHub, we use
Dropbox for sharing and collecting assignments. Not quite as good but
we can still see a lot.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the day, if a teacher doesn&#39;t look at a student&#39;s work
directly, a teacher isn&#39;t going to know everything there is to know
about a student. I can&#39;t imagine a top English teacher not reading a
student&#39;s essays. We&#39;re no different.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s time consuming and generally no fun but it&#39;s a big part of &lt;b&gt;real&lt;/b&gt;
education.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Free labor for the College Board and more angst for the kids</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-10-13-psat/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-10-13-psat/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
I won&#39;t be teaching my regular classes tomorrow. I&#39;ll be
meeting all my kids but classes will only be 12 minutes long.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, how will my colleagues and I spend the rest of the day?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Proctoring the PSAT.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This has always been a sore point with me. Back in the day, many
schools, Stuy included, offered the PSAT on the weekend. If you wanted
to proctor, you&#39;d come in and get paid a little extra. As a kid, if
you wanted to take the exam you&#39;d come in as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don&#39;t remember when it changed but at some point it did. The DOE
decreed that if you offered the PSAT during the week on school time,
the DOE would pay for the exams. This was done under the ridiculous
idea that all kids taking a test that counts for nothing is a good
thing. You can make a claim that having taken the PSAT gives the kids
some familiarity with the SAT but the SAT&#39;s value as a predictor of
college success is questionable at best anyway.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, setting things up like this is a great deal for the College
Board. It looks like they get a $15 per kid cash cow every year from
the NYC tax payers. It&#39;s a hidden expense so no one complains but we
keep shoveling the money out the door.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What&#39;s worse is that we also provide the College Board with free
labor - rather then spend my day teaching my kids I&#39;m working for free
for the College Board administering their test to my kids.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Teachers do the work, kids suffer through the exam, and the College
Board laughs all the way to the bank.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Not in with the in crowd - concerns about NYC &amp;#35CS4All</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-09-18-in-crowd/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-09-18-in-crowd/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sec-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Earlier this week, Mayor Bill deBlasio announced some ambitious
&lt;a href=&#34;http://avc.com/2015/09/computer-science-for-all/&#34;&gt;CS Education Plans&lt;/a&gt; for NYC. I posted a response &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/2015/09/15/failed.html#.Vfx1Rp_0-Ak&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Now that a few
days past, I thought I&#39;d clear a few things up.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
First and foremost, I hope my concerns are unfounded and I hope the
plan is a tremendous success.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What&#39;s got me bummed is not that I need to see my name in lights
given that in many ways I&#39;ve been a CS Ed trailblazer (although who doesn&#39;t
like a little ego stroking), rather that in my humble opinion NY has
squandered a great opportunity and resource and as a results, kids
won&#39;t get nearly all they could.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This STEMs from the fact that NYC has been unwilling to engage us,
StuyCS as a resource. We&#39;ve got the most experience and success in
building programs, training teachers, and teaching kids. What more
could you ask?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ve repeatedly reached out to and repeatedly invited in key
government and DOE players in an effort to try to get them to look at
our work and leverage it to do more good for more kids but over two
mayors and around fifteen years, the silence we get back is deafening.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, this isn&#39;t to say that I don&#39;t have some friends and supporters
in the CS Ed space. I consider &lt;a href=&#34;http://avc.com/2015/09/computer-science-for-all/&#34;&gt;Fred Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, the main man driving this
from the tech sector side to be a supporter, ally and friend. His
involvement is the key reason I think this whole thing might
work. Likewise, many people in the tech industry who&#39;ve worked with my
graduates are very supportive of my efforts and my actual graduates are
a wonderfully supportive family.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So why do the DOE and NYC people say they don&#39;t want to include us?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here are some of the things I get back:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&#34;org-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want something that works for all students.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This implies that our stuff is purely a result of Stuy being a school
with high achievers. My response?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&#34;org-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By saying all students but excluding high achievers, you can&#39;t mean
all students.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other high achieving schools haven&#39;t developed anything near what
we&#39;ve built.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and it also ignores the fact that:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&#34;org-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our nonprofit has had kids from around 40 to 50 schools and we
get rave reviews from those kids and their parents.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our gender numbers far outpace the national averages.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&#39;ve had teachers move on to other schools and customize our work
their.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sec-2&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and this is just the teaching part. What about our success in
designing an overall program or training teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course it doesn&#39;t help that Stuyvesant&#39;s own administration has
never recognized nor supported StuyCS.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You&#39;d think that those with the keys to the castle would engage and at
least consult with the people who&#39;ve been doing this successfully for
over 20 years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sec-3&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So who are these folk with the keys?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s a mix of people. Some in NYC government, some in DOE, some Tech
entrepreneurs, and running program. None have our experience or track
record and a number have neither taught nor coded.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why won&#39;t they really engage us?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You&#39;re guess is as good as mine but I have my suspicions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sec-4&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why am I concerned?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Because we have something to offer. NYC and DOE won&#39;t leverage us as a
resource. What other missteps will they make as they try to bring
CS4All.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have no control over all of this, all I can do is work in my little
corner of the world. If others want my help, my doors always open. If
not, I know there will always be some parents, kids, and educators who
get what we do and will benefit from it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>I should be happy but feel like I&#39;ve failed</title>

div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
The NY Times just posted an article - the  mayor announced a 10 year
deadline by which time all NYC public school students will be taking
CS.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I should be happy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m not.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I feel thoroughly defeated.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As many of you know, I&#39;ve struggled for years to try to bring CS
education to more kids and to train more teachers. You also probably
know that over the years, I&#39;ve become pretty good at this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why am I feeling so down about this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Because despite my best efforts I&#39;m no closer to my goal than day one.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Stuy is no closer to recognizing CS. I&#39;m still a just math teacher
and the DOE has given the job of running CS education to person after
person none whom had any real CS experience and few who have had any
real teaching experience.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I see plans based on dropping in curricula and quick fixes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I see programs run by people still wet behind the ears with respect to
CS Education.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m the only sane person in the room, or maybe
I&#39;m the loony. I&#39;m not sure.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Probably because I don&#39;t play well with others.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So I feel defeated.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Defeated because I know I have something to offer that the kids of NYC
deserve.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Defeated because I know they&#39;re not going to get it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m already looking to leave Stuy and public education.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Maybe this is just another sign that it&#39;s time.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why I have no faith in NYC Doing CS Ed right.</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-08-22-nycdo/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-08-22-nycdo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center text-align:center;
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sec-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This post is in response to an email thread on the NYTM mailing list.
I mentioned how the NYC DOE refused to even look at our program at
Stuy let alone support us and help us get to more kids.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Rather than pollute an email thread, I said I&#39;d write up the story
here.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ve been at the CS Ed game for a long time. Twenty five years to be
exact. One of my biggest frustrations and failures is that I&#39;ve never
been able to gain the support of the NYC Department of Education in my
efforts. Likewise, the only time I&#39;ve truly had the support of my
school&#39;s administration was during a brief period in the mid to late
90&#39;s.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My experiences have led me to believe that as CS Ed continues to gain
momentum I have no faith in NYC actually doing it right.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let me go through my experiences with the DOE over the years.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I won&#39;t use real names for either those who&#39;ve supported me or those
who&#39;ve been obstructionist.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here goes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-1-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sec-1-1&#34;&gt;Some background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34; id=&#34;text-1-1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m generally considered to be pretty good at what I do. There are
those that refer to me as the &#34;Godfather of CS Education in NYC.&#34;
Others refer to my graduates as the &#34;StuyCS mafia&#34; - a reference to
the fact that my graduates can be found all over the tech industry.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some people dismiss the Stuy program as being a product of the school
but we can produce evidence to the contrary.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ve heard from enough people in the tech industry and academia to
know that we&#39;ve built something special.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Even though I started to try to get the DOE&#39;s support shortly after
2001 and Stuy&#39;s support for my entire career, I really didn&#39;t make
serious attempts to connect with the DOE until the mid Bloomberg years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-1-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sec-1-2&#34;&gt;The later Bloomberg Administration 2005 - 2012&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34; id=&#34;text-1-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At this point, we had an established three year program at Stuy and we
had been around long enough to produce results.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I started to try to connect with the DOE to get them to come down and look
at our program - vet us - and then hopefully help us get to more
schools, more teachers, and ultimately more kids. I implored my
principal to help, cold emailed the chancellor, emailed and called up
the chain of command and at one point, my graduates wrote a letter to
the DOE and Mayor&#39;s office with hundreds of signatures.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was able to secure a meeting or two at Tweed but nothing ever came
of it. The people I spoke to had their own agenda - they weren&#39;t tech
people and frequently not educators and were more looking to see if I
could be used to push their agenda.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also pitched a school but that went nowhere.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A little later, people in the tech industry pushed the DOE to look at
what I was pitching.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A school was ultimately created but as soon as the tech community was
on board and the announcement was made, I was frozen out of the
process. The school went in a direction very different from what I was
pushing and I was told in no uncertain terms that I was to keep quiet
about the whole thing. Some of the story was written up in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/nyregion/software-engineering-school-was-teachers-idea-but-its-been-done-citys-way.html?_r=0&#34;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A little later, with the help of the tech community, we pitched
setting up Stuy as an official CS program (we&#39;re officially just math
teachers) and use us to train new teachers and to roll out programs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When the tech people were in the room, my principal and the DOE Deputy
Chancellor were very supportive. As soon as the tech people left,
I would get bounced around. The DOE would say &#34;it&#39;s the principal&#39;s
decision&#34; and my principal would say &#34;I wish we could do something but
there&#39;s no pathway in the DOE to get there.&#34;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the mean time, the DOE hired someone to run CS Education (something
I was told was not going to happen). He designed New York&#39;s original
Software Engineering Pilot. Looking at the guy&#39;s linkedin showed that
he had never had a teaching job nor a programming job. It shows from
what he developed.  He parlayed this position to something at Google a
few months later.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I reached out to him a few times - encouraged him to check us out -
nothing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-1-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sec-1-3&#34;&gt;And now&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34; id=&#34;text-1-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since then other people have been running CS at Tweed. I have yet to
see someone with a both a strong CS and teaching background in
charge.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have also repeatedly reached out to the people in charge.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Nothing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-1-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sec-1-4&#34;&gt;My thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34; id=&#34;text-1-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It doesn&#39;t seem to matter who&#39;s running the show. We&#39;ve got a great
program running in a public school in lower Manhattan and everyone
seems to know it and acknowledge it except the DOE.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Instead the DOE would rather take people with little or no experience
and have them try to figure this all out on the fly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I just don&#39;t see it ending well for the kids.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ve said it before - we will have CS in the schools but except for a
pocket here and there, it won&#39;t be good CS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Setting kids up to fail - CS edition</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-08-17-setting-up-to-fail-cs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sec-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We talked about setting kids up to fail in math. What about CS?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Well, it&#39;s a little subtler.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I started thinking about this after a conversation with one of my
graduates about Harvard&#39;s famous CS50. Since that conversation, I&#39;ve
spoken to a number of my kids that have gone through CS50 and most
seem to say the same things:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&#34;org-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They don&#39;t really teach anything
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The kids rely on a group member who already knows stuff or will
learn all the stuff on their own
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it weren&#39;t for my StuyCS background my group would have really
struggled.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and things like that. I was then told that after CS50 kids go on to
Functional Programming in OCAML and they drop like flies.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Doesn&#39;t sound like a recipe for success.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We&#39;re seeing this at multiple levels and we&#39;re seeing it because very
few places seem to have a plan. A multi year path taking kids from
start to finish. It&#39;s something we&#39;ve done and I&#39;m proud of it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think that if we look carefully, we&#39;ll start to see what my
graduates reported happening more and more. Traditional CS sequences
can be pretty unforgiving and unless colleges put in a sensible ramp
up and recognize that not all CS and related majors should go on to
grad school we&#39;re going to have a high rate of kids initially thinking
that CS is for them and then dropping. I do suspect it will get better as colleges
recognize that there&#39;s more than one type of CS major.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It will be interesting to see what happens on the high school
level. Will we see what we&#39;ve seen in math - two years on the first
level course then dump the kids into something like APCS A or will we
see something more sensible?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Where this really gets me is with all those after school and summer
programs. One give away is when a program claims &#34;learn to &lt;span class=&#34;underline&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;underline&#34;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 4
weeks,&#34; &#34;our kids learn more than in an AP class&#34;, or something similar.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My team and I have had to &#34;rescue&#34; kids from a number of
them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
These programs take a number of forms:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&#34;org-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using simplified environments that export to mobile
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gluing together libraries with minimal code
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with an extreme amount of coaching in a short period of
time.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, none of these things are necessarily bad but so many of these
programs are designed and run by non-educators.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, the kids go through the programs, think they know the real deal,
and are hammered when they enroll in a real CS class.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ve seen it happen. There was even an article a couple of years ago
which then went on to blame the teacher in spite of the fact that the
program boasts that thier kids &#34;learned more than in APCS.&#34;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, all these programs have to do is make sure the kids make
something exciting and that they&#39;re happy. There&#39;s no real
accountability and the guy at the next level will shoulder the blame.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So there you have it, setting kids up to fail.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s something I think we&#39;ll have to be more aware of and on guard for
as CS becomes more mainstream.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&#34;Four in ten NYC high schools don&#39;t offer Algebra 2 and both Physics and
Chemistry.&#34;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At least that&#39;s what this &lt;a href=&#34;http://ny.chalkbeat.org/2015/07/23/report-many-nyc-high-schools-dont-offer-advanced-math-and-science-courses/#.Vbjz1d-c30o%0A&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; and linked report say.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The implication is clear - many of our students don&#39;t have the
opportunity to advance in math and the sciences.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The truth though is much more disturbing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The reason why these schools aren&#39;t offering Algebra 2 is very
simple - the kids aren&#39;t ready for it. Any math licensed teacher is
qualified and capable of teaching any level of regents math which
includes Algebra 2 and Trigonometry. The truth is that the students
in these schools by and large aren&#39;t getting past Geometry.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Even in some highly touted &lt;a href=&#34;https://garyrubinstein.wordpress.com/2014/11/11/is-p-tech-a-miracle-school-or-a-failing-school/%0A&#34;&gt;&#34;miracle schools,&#34;&lt;/a&gt; looking behind the
curtain reveals kids ill prepared to get through geometry.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The disturbing part is that these kids are set up to fail - to take a
class and exam that they&#39;re ill prepared for only to have their self
esteem crushed. Why? Because more kids taking more exams at higher
levels is perceived to look good.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In New York, students have to take three years of math to graduate
high school. Two years can be spent on one level of math and of course
Regents exams are king.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then you have the classes: Algebra, Geometry, and then Algebra 2 and
Trig. Algebra is by far the easiest course. Geometry, which is really
a course in logic and deductive reasoning using Euclidean Geometry as
a platform is &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;much&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; heavier.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Lets see how things play out.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In &#34;high performing&#34; populations you have kids take Algebra in the 8th
grade. By and large the kids do fine in the class and on the regents
exams but, at least according to my colleagues, these kids don&#39;t
really internalize the skills, they just learn the mechanics.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In schools with struggling populations, they don&#39;t start Algebra until
high school and then do it over two years. This leads to a reasonable
pass rate but then the kids are placed in geometry and are taking a
much more rigorous course in half the time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The results are predictable.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I graded geometry regents this past June. I graded two long answer
questions with a combined value of 10 points. From unscreened
schools, including at least one highly regarded one, the median grade
was 0 and the mean not far above. Even in screened schools the results
weren&#39;t much better. There we saw a bi-modal distribution with kids
either doing very well or very poorly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why do we set these kids up to fail? Because, test scores are king and
kids are required to pass regents to graduate. Schools and teachers
aren&#39;t allowed to do what&#39;s best for kids. Schools and teachers must
answer to the politicians - remember, my rating and job depends on how
kids do on standardized tests.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You start to feel even worse when you start thinking about the value
or lack thereof in lots of what we require in high school.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why am I writing about math?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Well, to find out you&#39;ll have to tune in next time when I talk about
the CS side of things.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This image has been making its rounds.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Largest expansion is pretty clear but are the largest gain in 3+
scores mean a higher percentage of 3+ scores or merely the result of
more test takers?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m curious, but that&#39;s not what I wanted to talk about.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Looking at our AP results from this year we had:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/img/teaching-to-the-test/2015.png&#34; alt=&#34;2015.png&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For the past two years we&#39;ve been allowed to run 7 sections of AP
Computer Science with about 30 kids per class. Prior to that we were
limited to five sections. There hasn&#39;t been a change in either percent
passing and more importantly the percentage of 4 and 5 scores for
years. I suspect that if we were allowed to open more sections to meet
demands the overall percentage of 4/5 scores would remain the same.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
While we always are mostly 4s and 5s, the interesting point this year
is that we had a much higher percentage of 5s to 4s.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Two possibilities I can think of. One is that the depending on how the test is scored
and the fact that there were so many additional test takers it changed the
curve. Since I&#39;ve never been involved in the scoring, I can&#39;t comment
on this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The other change is that the College Board dropped the case study - a
large sample project that students are supposed to study throughout
the class. Between 20% and 30% of the AP Exam was based on the case
study.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m guessing that some teachers liked the case study but it never
worked for me. What&#39;s more, all of us at Stuy pretty much agree on the
subject. It&#39;s like those CS texts that have one long continuous
project throughout &amp;#x2013; if the project, its design and implementation
make sense to you and how you teach, you can just work through the
text. If not, the text becomes next to useless.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We all hated the case study and so we all paid it minimal lip
service. Teaching the case study would amount to teaching to the
test. We&#39;d rather teach Computer Science &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;fnr.1&#34; name=&#34;fnr.1&#34; class=&#34;footref&#34; href=&#34;#fn.1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m pretty certain that some of our kids were slowed down on the AP
exam due to our approach to the case study but they still did fine and
besides, for our kids, the exam generally doesn&#39;t mean a thing. In our
experience if a student goes to the CS department at their college and
shows their stuff, they&#39;ll be placed appropriately. It didn&#39;t matter
if they got a 5, a 4, a 3, or even if they didnt take the exam at all.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Perhaps that&#39;s the reason for our uptick in 5s vs 4s. No case study
and all of a sudden our kids weren&#39;t at a disadvantage.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I can&#39;t say for certain but it seems plausible.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If we taught to the test, I&#39;m guessing more students would have scored
5s all along.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The concern?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If the College Board continues to be the driving force, either solo or
in partnership with organizations like code.org, the importance of the
AP Exam will remain. It&#39;s already considered by many the gold
standard - if your kids take and do well on AP exams, your school must
be a top school.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Educators know better. AP Exams are not the be all and end all and in
fact, many of us would like to be rid of them altogether so that we
could just teach rigorous courses and not to the test.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The end game is predictable. Just as we will see more and more
teaching to the test in common core and regents classes so we will see
in computer science.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I predict that there will be a few pockets of excellence here and
there but in the end, canned AP prep will win the day. We&#39;ll have CS
in the schools but not so much good CS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

worked for you, then it&#39;s not teaching to the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Why don&#39;t we trust teachers or Rubber Room Light?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-06-24-grading-regents/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-06-24-grading-regents/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s Wednesday morning. I&#39;m sitting in an unairconditioned room. I
really shouldn&#39;t be writing this since we were told &#34;NO ELECTRONIC
DEVICES!!!&#34;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Where am I? Up at a school on East 96th street grading the geometry
regents.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Back in the day schools gave exams then schools graded
exams. Typically by committee. You&#39;d get a room full of math teachers,
each teacher would take a problem or two and we&#39;d work through class
envelopes. When all was said and done each question was checked by at
least two teachers and the whole process took under a day - usually
from the morning until a little after lunch.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
How does it work now? Each school sends a bunch of teachers to an off
site school. How many? In our case we sent more teachers than we have
teaching geometry. In my case, I haven&#39;t taught math in 23 years but
I was part of the group.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We then were assigned to rooms, then questions, and the marking
begins, oh wait, not before mind numbing hour to make sure we know how
to grade the questions. It&#39;s similar but far less efficient. When
we grade in house, you can just chug through envelopes of exams -
here, we spent almost half the time sitting around doing nothing,
waiting for exams to be sent to the room. We are, of course, forbidden
from having electronic devices so we can&#39;t be productive during this
dead time - it&#39;s a mild form of incarceration or what I&#39;d call &#34;rubber
room light.&#34; Oh, also the questions are only looked at by one grader -
no double checking like in the old days.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
All our papers were graded before we left yesterday &amp;#x2013; of course that
didn&#39;t stop the site leaders from forcing us to sit around doing
nothing for an hour before releasing us. Were we done? Could we return
to our schools to get actual end of term work done? Of course not. We
had to come back this morning to sit around doing nothing waiting for
the DOE to say we were done.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To all you folks that complain about us lazy teachers - all we wanted
was to get back to our schools and get back to work - it&#39;s the DOE
that&#39;s saying no - you must sit around doing nothing - when you see
those news stories about rubber rooms - don&#39;t be so quick to blame the
teachers - many times it&#39;s the DOE that&#39;s to blame for keeping a good
teacher out of the classroom and wasting taxpayer money.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why do we mark papers this way? Simple, the government doesn&#39;t trust
the teachers. We spend all day with your kids but heaven forbid we
grade their exams. Truth be told, we don&#39;t need regents exams to
evaluate our kids &amp;#x2013; we know them - we&#39;re with them all year. That
said, if you do need a test - let&#39;s mark them in house.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Are there grade irregularities? In spite of the periodic story, I
doubt they&#39;re widespread - and no - giving a paper a one over to make
sure a kid got all the points the deserve is not cheating.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course none of this affects charter schools - they grade their
papers in house. No incentive to misbehave there. It&#39;s just those
greedy corrupt public school teachers that we have to keep an eye on.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Don&#39;t get me started on the actual exam - one where kids are set up to
fail left and right - that&#39;s a story for another day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sec-1&#34;&gt;Postscript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now that I&#39;m home and back on line I can finish this off and post it.
We sat around today until 11:30 and then were told to go to lunch and
return at 12:30. Shortly after we got back we were finally dismissed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
End result: I ended up spending under one quarter of a day grading
exams and two and three quarter days sitting around all because of
asinine department of education policies.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Is there any wonder why I can&#39;t recommend kids go into teaching these
days?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

In writing this post I do not mean to say that there aren&#39;t some great
programs out there - there are. I also know that most of the programs
I&#39;m aware are being developed by people who are really trying to do
some good.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Since I wrote a post on my problem with drop in curricula on March 4
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/2015/03/04/expedient-vs-good.html&#34;&gt;http://cestlaz.github.io/2015/03/04/expedient-vs-good.html&lt;/a&gt;)
I&#39;ve been meaning to follow up with some of my thoughts on after
school and summer programs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This itch was further spurred when I read this post on &lt;a href=&#34;http://avc.com&#34;&gt;avc.com&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://avc.com/2015/03/numbers-can-ruin-a-good-story/&#34;&gt;http://avc.com/2015/03/numbers-can-ruin-a-good-story/&lt;/a&gt;. It talks about
startups - you can have a good story and raise some funds but then
when numbers, that is, results start to come in, that story might not
look so good.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The world of CS Education summer and after school programs are full of
&#34;good stories.&#34; My favorite is &#34;your kid will learn how to build an
iPhone app in 4 weeks!!!&#34; If it were that easy, we wouldn&#39;t have a
tech talent shortage and my grads wouldn&#39;t be in such high demand.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The truth is, it&#39;s very easy to get by in CS Education on nothing more
than a good story. You never actually have to show real results. Most
of the programs out there follow this pattern. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s
intentional. It&#39;s just that most people running K12 CS Ed programs
aren&#39;t educators and frequently they aren&#39;t CS people. What they are
concerned is scaling so that they can get to as many kids as
possible. They aren&#39;t dealing with next steps. Besides, to them, it
appears they&#39;re doing great work - they buy into their own hype.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What&#39;s the problem?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Simple - learning takes time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
How do you set up the story?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Easy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Start by promising an awesome program - an awesome project after two
or four weeks. With today&#39;s tools it&#39;s easy to make a mock up. Either
you use simplified tools or you can use a lot of boilerplate code with
pre-built components. These aren&#39;t necessarily bad in and of
themselves, just don&#39;t pretend you&#39;re teaching the real deal.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s easy to pull this off since there&#39;s no real follow up. Kids are
then sent back to their high schools or off to college and results
aren&#39;t tracked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Also, make sure you recruit some high performing kids. I know a number
of programs that have taken in my Stuy kids even though they already
know more than the program has to offer. This guarantees that your
program will look good since these kids &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;will&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; produce great projects.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I recall about a year and a half ago reading an article. It
highlighted a youngster who went through one of these summer
programs. A bright kid in a well regarded, well hyped, well funded
program. I&#39;ve don&#39;t think the article said so, but I heard many of this
programs top people repeatedly say &#34;our program better prepares our
kids for the AP Computer Science exam than the AP course itself does.&#34;
Hmmm. Well, in the article, the kid learned all these wonderful things
from the program and then went back to high school.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A short time after, according to the piece, the kid was struggling in
AP Computer Science and the article quickly threw the teacher under
the bus. Now, I have no idea if the teacher was any good but if your
program better prepares a kid for the exam than the class, there&#39;s not
way the kid should have been struggling - unless, of course, it was
all a story.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The truth is, that the designers and implementers of many of these programs
don&#39;t know education and often know little CS. I can&#39;t tell
you the number of kids that have come into my classes and programs
proclaiming to be master programmers as a result of these programs and
it turns out all they know is how to build a limited drag and drop
prototype or how to tweak a pre-built template.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What&#39;s the harm? In my classes and programs, we can educate the kids
but if this is in college with less support, self doubt will creep in
and more often than not the kid will drop tech. I&#39;ve seen it happen
many a time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That brings me to the next story &amp;#x2013; the glue programs. I also see a
lot of this. Programs that teach the very rudiments of programming and
then use pre-built libraries and packages to make really impressive
looking results. They look great, but there&#39;s not a lot of substance
under the hood. I remember seeing a number of these &#34;finished
products&#34; and each time noting that the student contributed maybe 20 to
40 lines of code and they were mostly tweaks to the web site samples.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The final story is less of a story and more legit in terms of teaching
but it still largely a story. That&#39;s when a program tries to teach too
much to quickly. I&#39;ve seen one and two week programs that promise the
word. The kids put together some impressive stuff but since it&#39;s so
much so fast, facilitated by lots of coaching, there&#39;s little
retention and questionable understanding.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was talking to a friend a few months ago. She worked with a number
of high achieving kids teaching them to code. All seemed great. They
got the kids back together months later for a follow up. I asked &#34;how
was the retention?&#34; The reply &#34;that&#39;s a real problem.&#34;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
the truth is learning takes time. There&#39;s only so much you can do in
an after-school or in a summer and it&#39;s not always flashy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When I designed Google CAPE NYC for the summer of 2010 I knew we
couldn&#39;t do everything in a month. What we did do is give the kids the
fundamentals and a path to follow to learn more. They did neat
projects but they weren&#39;t the over the top stuff you see other
programs produce (as an aside, one of my grads noted - &#34;If it looks
too good to be true, it probably isn&#39;t true.&#34;). While we didn&#39;t
formally track the kids, 3/4 of the kids we were still in touch with
last year were still doing computer science at a second year college
level so I know what we did worked but I haven&#39;t seen that type follow
up from any other program.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We&#39;re in the midst of recruiting and fund-raising for my non-profit,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://cstuy.org&#34;&gt;CSTUY&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s summer program, &lt;a href=&#34;http://cstuy.org/programs/ship&#34;&gt;SHIP&lt;/a&gt;. We&#39;re not as connected as the big CS
programs and we don&#39;t have the hype. That makes our job harder.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What I do know is that we&#39;ve got the best teachers and the best
program and that our kids might not make something quite so flashy
after three or four weeks as some of the other programs, our kids are
set up for long term success.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, if you&#39;re looking for a great program with great teachers and a
solid plan, check out CSTUY. If you want to create a story, just follow
these steps:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&#34;org-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recruit some high achieving kids so you&#39;ll have some stories
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teach a framework or simplified tool
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coaching, coaching, coaching.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure they have fun so you get good reviews
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit!!!!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we don&#39;t do anything then only schools like Stuy will have CS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sec-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I heard that the other day. It was a comment relating to a number of
efforts, both in and out of  NY to get CS into the classroom.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
These programs abound and up front let me say that they&#39;re all well
meaning and have the best of intentions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In NYC, programs receiving money, publicity, and support, include:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&#34;org-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Software Engineering Pilot (SEP)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google CS First afterschool
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The NSF grant bring the Beauty and Joy of Computing class to NYC (BGP)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Terrific &amp;#x2013; we&#39;ll scale up CS ed in NY from nothing to everyone in no
time. It&#39;s fast, it scales. But is it good.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sec-2&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;d argue that maybe it&#39;s not. These programs all share a few things
in common.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
First, they&#39;re all expedient. You can implement them in an election
cycle. Roll out a pre-fab curriculum with scripted lessons, give the
teachers a summer and some weekend workshops and we&#39;re good to go. No
CS knowledge needed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Next, as far as I can tell, none were developed by experienced high school
teachers with a deep knowledge of CS.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The SEP was originally developed by someone, who, according to his
linked in profile never coded and never taught.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I could be wrong about BGP. It was developed by Dan Garcia - an
educator whom I like and respect, but as far as I know, his experience
is at the college level.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And Google&#39;s CS First? I&#39;ve been very impressed by Google&#39;s engineers,
in fact, many are my former students. It&#39;s high school education team?
Not so much.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Finally, these efforts buy into the myth that anyone can teach and
that anyone can teach computer science. Even worse, the Google CS
First claims people running their program don&#39;t need to know a thing
about computer science.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Anyone who knows teaching knows that you can&#39;t learn a subject well
enough to reall teach it in such a short period of time. Of course,
it does align itself with education &#34;reform&#34; where the true master
teacher is no longer desirable and we should all be drones that teach
lessons from scripts and all testing shall be standardized.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I rememer the first time I saw a progarm like this - it was the CISCO
Networking Academy. Teachers trained for a few weeks in the summer and
the course was basically run via computer based tutorials. I can&#39;t
speak for it nationally but in my experience, what the students
learned was superficial - very test oriented and there was no value
added by the teacher - even after years of &#34;teaching&#34; the
classes. There&#39;s a reason why the few networking lessons in our System
Programming class are called &#34;CISCO in an hour.&#34; The kids learn more
in those couple of lessons than in a year of the CISCO curriculum.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Who was to blame? Cisco? They were trying to do something good. The
teacher? Partially, after time they should have learned something of
networking but they were very much out of their element having started
the process from zero tech experience.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The fact is, that got a &#34;Computer Networking&#34; class into the
schools. It might have been meant as a stop-gap until we could get
real Computer Networking teachers hired or trained but it ended up
being good enough. The end result &amp;#x2013; bad classes and students not
learning what they could.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sec-3&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So here we are back again at the &#34;let&#39;s take non CS teachers, give
them some PD and we&#39;ll be good.&#34; Rather than take the time to solve
the CS Education problem, we&#39;re going to throw down a curriculum, do
some PD and say that it will buy us time. The truth is, however, that
we&#39;re going to say &#34;look, we have CS in the schools&#34; and it will be
good enough.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;d argue, though that for CS, good enough is particularly
dangerous. It&#39;s very easy to work through a scripted and coached
program and end up with kids thinking they know some real CS and have
a real product yet having not really learned the subject. This won&#39;t
be exposed until later, when they&#39;re gone and in college. I predict
that unless something changes, these efforts and similar ones will
drive up the  number of people who after this exposure will say they
love CS but once they get hit over the head with &#34;funcitonal
programming in HASKELL&#34; or whatever real CS they see in college,
they&#39;ll drop like flies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sec-4&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What&#39;s the answer? We&#39;ve got to stop doing what&#39;s expedient and do
what&#39;s good and what&#39;s right.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sec-5&#34;&gt;Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-5&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A couple of other blog itches I want to scratch are the many after
school, summer, and drop in programs to go with the there I mentioned
above. Hopefully I&#39;ll get to rant about them soon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Believing in what you&#39;re doing</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-02-25-good-idea-avc/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-02-25-good-idea-avc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The other day, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fredwilson&#34;&gt;Fred Wilson&lt;/a&gt; sent out a short tweet storm turned &lt;a href=&#34;http://avc.com/2015/02/is-this-a-good-startup-idea/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on
determining if an entrepreneur&#39;s startup idea is a good one. It&#39;s
short. Take a minute to read it over.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At its core, the post and the comments talk about belief in an idea
and it got me thinking about some things as an educator.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Tweet 7:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and you have to believe in yourself and your idea or nobody else ever will
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
resonated with me, not just in terms of a startup idea, but with
respect to one&#39;s passion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a CS teacher we get to shepherd kids through projects big and
small. The best work invariably comes from when the kids take an idea
they&#39;re passionate about and run with it. Sometimes I can guide the
kids to an idea and it works out well but when the kids end up working
on the stock project the results are less spectacular.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Once the kids buy into a great idea, the educator has to create a
framework for success - give the kids the tools and set up the safety
nets when things don&#39;t go as planned.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ve never liked all those student entrepreneurs programs &amp;#x2013; make a
business for the sake of making a business - much better to help guide
the kids towards something they&#39;re passionate about and help them run
with it. That&#39;s when great things happen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The neat thing is that it&#39;s not limited to classes. CSTUY is having
its first hackathon in a few weeks; &lt;a href=&#34;http://cstuy.org/programs/defhacks&#34;&gt;def hacks():&lt;/a&gt;. One of my juniors
came to me with the idea - she got a couple more kids on board and
we&#39;re off to the races. I&#39;ve done some things behind the scenes to
make sure we don&#39;t have any real problems but the awesome thing is
that the event is all on the kids.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In a way, I&#39;d imagine that Fred, as a VC, once he invests, his role is to
help create the framework for success. I&#39;d also imagine that the
best way to do that is similar to what a great teacher does - bring
out the best in the student, make them aware of pitfalls and be a
supportive mentor.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On a deeper level, as teachers, we get to work with young people as
they&#39;re developing their own passions. This was something else that I
started thinking about after reading Fred&#39;s tweet storm, in particular
tweet 9:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
because I never want someone telling me they wasted five years of
their life on something because I told them it was a good idea
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Teachers are role models and the best teachers are passionate about
their subject and their craft. One of the things I&#39;m most proud of is
the number of friends, former students, who have told me that I gave
them a career, I introduced them to their passion. Sometimes, though,
we miss. I&#39;ve seen some kids come through my program and leave loving
CS but it was, at least in part, an illusion. I work with a great team
and sometimes loving classes can stand in for loving a subject.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was talking to my daughter when she was a senior at Stuy and she
commented that she was missing all the subjects she loved one day when
she had to leave early. She included math. I said &#34;since when do you
love math?&#34; She respond &#34;I meant I love math class.&#34; That makes sense
she had an amazing teacher.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, at times, kids leave us for college and then they might discover
that they don&#39;t love CS as much as they thought they did.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, I&#39;m not overly concerned with our misses here since I think we do
better than most in showing CS and Tech for what it is and we always
leave the kids with a great set of mental and practical tools but
every now and then I see a kid who is doing well in the tech industry
and in my gut I feel that the world missed out on a great author,
chemist, or doctor.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, I&#39;ve rambled on this long enough - just some food for thought from
a teacher.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teachers, Rockstars, and the Godfather</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-12-14-rockstar-godfather/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-12-14-rockstar-godfather/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
In a &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2014/12/tech-companies-and-computer-science.html&#34;&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alfredtwo&#34;&gt;Alfred Thompson&lt;/a&gt; referred to an &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2012/12/advice-to-microsoft-education.html&#34;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; where he
mentioned rock star CS teachers. That&#39;s a term I&#39;ve heard thrown
around a lot in the past few years. I&#39;ve heard some of my graduates
referred to as rock stars - top tech people, and in fact I&#39;ve seen
some of them courted for positions in a manner that a rock star might
be accustomed to. I&#39;ve periodically referred to some of my colleagues
as rock stars, but I don&#39;t know if the term really fits.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, how else are us teacher folk referred to? More than once I&#39;ve been
called &lt;a href=&#34;http://avc.com/2014/04/ship-st-josephs-a-summer-coding-program-in-nyc/&#34;&gt;the godfather of K-12 CS education in NYC&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe because I&#39;ve
been in the game so long or maybe because a friend once coined the
phrase &#34;StuyCS Mafia&#34; to refer to my graduates. It&#39;s flattering, but
like rock star, it doesn&#39;t quite fit the bill. Don Corleone rose to
power through both fear and respect. I certainly hope I&#39;m not feared
and while I do believe that the people whose opinion I care about
respect me, it&#39;s far from universal.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, where does that leave teachers like me, or more so, teachers I
aspire to be like?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Not the godfather and not rockstars.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We&#39;re bluesmen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Huh?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Well, the bluesman&#39;s got the chops that the rock star may or may not
have. In fact, the rock star always talks about how the bluesman was
his greatest influence and inspiration.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But, the rock star gets the accolades and the attention while the
bluesman toils in relative obscurity tending to his craft and if
acknowledged it&#39;s well after his career has ended.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, there you have it. The best teachers I know are not rock stars,
they&#39;re bluesmen all about honing their craft and inspiring their
students.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One of the things Alfred talked about in his post is the top down
influence on CS education. On the one hand, it&#39;s brought attention to
bear but on the other hand it&#39;s being driven by people who don&#39;t
really get education.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The same can be said for the overall recent big money influences on
education.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We&#39;d be much better off if those in power stopped playing rock star
and started listening to the bluesmen.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thoughts on diversity</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-12-07-thoughts-on-diversity/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-12-07-thoughts-on-diversity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, my buddy &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/snikolov&#34;&gt;Stan&lt;/a&gt; pointed me to this article:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/12/to-address-techs-diversity-woes-start-with-the-vanishing-comp-sci-classroom/&#34;&gt;&#34;To address tech’s diversity woes, start with the vanishing Comp Sci classroom&#34;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It gives a reasonable overview of the gender issues in computer
science education. The article talks about the drop in popularity of
the old Advanced Placement AB course and its eventually being dropped
as well as thoughts on how the current A course is pretty dry.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It made me think about the old vs new exams. The current APCS A exam
is roughly analogous to a typical college 101 course: programming in
one language and one paradigm. The old AB class represented a 101 and
a 102 with the 102 being data structures and algorithms. Much more
interesting for both guys and girls. Over the years, the AP A exam has
become more and more vocational, at least in my opinion, and that
makes matters worse. Its more and more about using the language and
built in collections and less about thinking and problem
solving. What&#39;s fun about that?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, we teach our version, a super-set, of the AB curriculum over
the course of a school year.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Interesting that even though we teach that old school hardcore CS, we
far exceed the national numbers in terms of gender balance, but more
on that later.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One of the big things going on right now is the AP CS Principles
course. There&#39;s some good stuff in there but I&#39;ve got a lot of
questions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To start, I&#39;m tired of hearing that it&#39;s a college level course. If
a course is designed so that a 10th grader can be successful, it&#39;s not
college level. I do understand that it&#39;s being taught in places like
Berekely (and as an aside I both like and greatly respect Dan Garcia,
who&#39;s the architect of one version of CS principles - the Beauty and
Joy of Computing, and his work). If my kids were doing in college what
they could have been doing in 10th grade, something&#39;s wrong. That&#39;s
not to say that you can&#39;t have a similar course at both levels, just
that there&#39;s a &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;huge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; difference between a 10th grader and a college
freshman.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also take issue with the drag and drop languages in high school and
beyond. True, there&#39;s a low cost of entry, but then it&#39;s limiting in
oh so many ways. Much slower than a keyboard interface, limited screen
real estate, and no clear exit to traditional textual
programming. Scratch and the like are probably good for younger kids,
but I&#39;ve had to rescue many a kid from the damage done by drag and
drop. I&#39;m not advocating starting a high schooler in Haskell with Vim
but there are plenty of tools that are both accessible, easy entry,
fun, but at the same time real.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We also see the proliferation of all girl after school programs. I
don&#39;t have any problem with this per se. I think we need some all
girls and some co-ed. In fact, one of the young ladies in our summer
program commented on how much she liked the fact that we weren&#39;t all
girls but we created a wonderful environment where everyone felt
comfortable and supported.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some of those programs do great things in terms of exposing girls to
role models and to what&#39;s possible. My issue is with the actual
education, notably because these programs invariably don&#39;t have real
educator/computer scientists running the show. They teach a watered
down CS or conversely too much too quickly and then the girls are
clobbered at the next level, they start doubting themselves and they
change majors.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The problems with these after school programs as well as with CS
Principles are the same. A few of my students who studied CS at
Harvard framed it nicely when talking about Harvard&#39;s highly
publicized CS50 course (I&#39;m paraphrasing and combining thoughts here):
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They don&#39;t really teach anything, you&#39;ve got to do it mostly on your
own. In the end you don&#39;t really learn anything.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then, they go on to Harvard&#39;s next real CS class - functional
programming with no real preparation and they drop like flies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, what do you do?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You do what we did.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I developed an intro course over 10 years ago. The new AP Principles
course has some overlap in terms of concepts but one big difference is
that we dive into programming using two real languages. &lt;a href=&#34;http://racket-lang.org/&#34;&gt;Scheme&lt;/a&gt;, which
is mathy functional and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/index.shtml&#34;&gt;NetLogo&lt;/a&gt; which is visual and interactive but
still text based. We then move on to a number of really neat concepts
in Python.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
People say, &#34;Oh, you do the NetLogo because it&#39;s visual and appeals to
girls.&#34; No - we do NetLogo because it&#39;s cool and it appeals to
kids. Same with Scheme. Show me a girl that loves the visual stuff,
I&#39;ll show you a girl that loves Scheme&#39;s functional goodness. I might
only be a dopey old school teacher, but I really believe &#34;kids are
kids.&#34;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On top of this, you get great teachers that really know their stuff
(and we&#39;ve built plenty of them over the years) and create a culture
with everyone&#39;s accepted and good things happen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
By the time our kids leave us, they&#39;ve got enough under their belts so
they not only know their stuff but they have the confidence that they
know their stuff.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
How does it work for us? Nationally, about 19% of APCS test takers are
women. At Stuy, we hover around 30%. My Software Development, Post AP
classes are also around 30% so we keep them. Oh, and Stuy is only 40%
female and we do much worse than the national averages in other
traditionally male dominated fields such as physics.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, I was talking to one of our CSTUY hackers as we ended the
day. We were talking about possible directions to go in after the new
year. We could stay graphical, go to text processing, look at some
hardcore algorithms and more. I asked Aruna what she thought. Her
answer: &#34;It&#39;s all fun.&#34;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>VamVoom - Turning teachers into rubble</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-11-02-vamvoom/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-11-02-vamvoom/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Earlier today I saw a friend&#39;s Facebook post questioning the sanity of
common core math. He had an issue with the way his daughter was being
forced to work out problems. A few of us chimed in with our low
op pinion on Common Core, others said they thought it was a good
idea. I think the fact that my buddy was questioning it is a major
strike against CC. This guy isn&#39;t just a friend, he&#39;s a math
teacher. Maybe the best one I know. In fact, he&#39;s the teacher I aspire
to be. If he&#39;s got a problem with how math is taught, he&#39;s probably right.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I made a comment also referring to VAM - the idea that teachers should
be evaluated by &#34;Value added Measures&#34; - that is, student test
scores. Another friend asked about it. I thought I&#39;d write my response
up here.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is just my opinion - I&#39;ve read a number of pieces over the past
couple of years and the facts to back up any assertions I&#39;m making
should be pretty easy to find by searching the web.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-unnumbered-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unnumbered-1&#34;&gt;The idea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-unnumbered-1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
VAM is all about evaluating teachers based on standardized tests. In
our case, we&#39;re talking NY State common core and regents exams. The
idea is to tie teacher ratings, and in some cases licensing to these
tests.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-unnumbered-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unnumbered-2&#34;&gt;The exams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-unnumbered-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&#39;s start with the problems with the exams. There&#39;s been a fair
amount of discussion over the past couple of years with regards to age
appropriateness and over testing. I&#39;m not going to talk about
them. Let&#39;s just look at two things.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-unnumbered-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;unnumbered-3&#34;&gt;The gag order&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-4&#34; id=&#34;text-unnumbered-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teachers aren&#39;t allowed to talk about common core tests. The
questions, scoring, grading - everything is a secret.  Methinks
Pearson and NY State has something to hide. The party line is that
then questions can be reused - I&#39;m calling BS on this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ve been teaching 25 years. I give about 12 exams a year per class
plus quizzes, homework, and other assessments. None of them are secret
and somehow I manage as does every other teacher.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
By keeping everything a secret there&#39;s no accountability. Politicians
love to talk about accountability and transparency as long as it&#39;s for
others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-unnumbered-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;unnumbered-4&#34;&gt;The scoring&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-4&#34; id=&#34;text-unnumbered-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back in the day, regents exams were given and scored. Old exams were
public as was the scoring. If you got over a 65 you passed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, your exam is graded and then only after the fact, when the
numbers are in, does the state decide how to map raw scores to final
grades. Basically, the state can decide how many kids pass and by how
much and they do this after the fact.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sound fishy and susceptible to political influence?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-unnumbered-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unnumbered-5&#34;&gt;The evaluations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-unnumbered-5&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, the exams that VAM&#39;s based on are already suspect. Let&#39;s dig
further. At Stuy, 40% of teacher evaluations are from standardized
tests. If you teach one of the magic subjects - English, Math, maybe
History - 20% of your results are based on your students results and
20% on the school or departmental results.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, if you&#39;re like me and don&#39;t teach regents classes,
40% of my rating is based on exams in subjects I don&#39;t even teach.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Even if you could evaluate a teacher based on student exams, surely
you can&#39;t judge a computer science teacher based on another teacher&#39;s
students English exam scores.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On top of this, the formula is another one of those state
secrets. It&#39;s not public and it&#39;s worked out after the fact. The state
can basically look at all the numbers and then decide where to put the
cutoffs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-unnumbered-6&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unnumbered-6&#34;&gt;More problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-unnumbered-6&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They abound. Here are a few:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Just about all of my kids do very well on the AP Computer Science
exam. Am I a good teacher because they all do well or a bad one since
they don&#39;t improve.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What about the kid that doesn&#39;t do particularly well but ends up
ultimately becoming a computer professional. I&#39;ve had a number of
graduates that fit this bill that have credited me with setting the
spark. According to the system those students are failures as am I.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What about kids that don&#39;t have the same teacher all year? Those that
already know the subject? Family factors?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On top of this, people, like my friend and colleague Gary
Rubinstein have shown that VAM scores vary wildly and there have been
numerous reports showing that evaluating teacher based on student test
scores doesn&#39;t work and is just a bad idea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-unnumbered-7&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unnumbered-7&#34;&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-unnumbered-7&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
VAM is just another reason I can&#39;t recommend teaching to pretty much
anyone.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Teacher&#39;s aren&#39;t against being evaluated, we just want a fair and
meaningful evaluation and more importantly a structure that can help
us do better.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-unnumbered-8&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unnumbered-8&#34;&gt;The title&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-unnumbered-8&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, for the title, I keep seeing Vavoom - a character from &#34;Felix the
Cat&#34; that could level mountains with a single VAVOOM
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teacher Ratings</title>

      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sec-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A while back I posted about the new teacher evaluation system in New York.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sec-2&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I originally wrote about the system &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/2013/09/06/why_i_might_no_longer_be_an_effective_teacher.html#.VAZVNR_GyzU&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and a little more &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/2013/10/25/effective-teacher-2.html#.VAZVMx_GyzU&#34;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sec-3&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Well, the results are in and I got my evaluation. What type of teacher
am I? According to New York City I&#39;m &#34;Effective,&#34; which is basically
run of the mill.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sec-4&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&#39;s look a little deeper. At the end of the day, each teachers
receive a numeric score from 0 to 100. The score maps to a grade as
follows:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table border=&#34;2&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; cellpadding=&#34;6&#34; rules=&#34;groups&#34; frame=&#34;hsides&#34;&gt;


&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col  class=&#34;left&#34; /&gt;

&lt;col  class=&#34;left&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;left&#34;&gt;0 - 64&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Ineffective&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;left&#34;&gt;65 - 74&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Developing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;left&#34;&gt;75 - 90&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Effective&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;left&#34;&gt;91 - 100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Highly Effective&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With &#34;Effective&#34; being pretty much the old &#34;Satisfactory.&#34;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My overall score was 88.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
How did they arrive at that?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Over the course of the school year
teachers are evaluated by their supervisors. Using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://danielsongroup.org/framework/&#34;&gt;Danielson
Framework&lt;/a&gt; for teaching. I consider the Danielson stuff bunk and have
yet to be observed by someone who knows my subject area (Computer Science)
but I do have a fair supervisor who is supportive of her teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I scored 58 out of 60.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The rest of the rating comes from standardized tests. Let me once
again go on record to state that basing teacher ratings on student
scores is asinine but it&#39;s actually worse. For teachers like myself
who don&#39;t teach regents courses, our scores come from school composite
grades. The city/state have super secret formulas that, incidentally
are figured out after the results are in to map my schools regents
results onto my evaluation grade. Yep, 40% of my rating is based on
students I haven&#39;t taught taking exams in subjects I don&#39;t teach.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The end result? We were awarded 30 out of 40 points.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The end result 58+30=88.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, since my kids didn&#39;t show growth on history and English regents,
I&#39;m a run of the mill teacher.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think it&#39;s time to find another profession.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>State test scores - don&#39;t fall into the trap</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-08-25-state-tests/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-08-25-state-tests/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-0-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sec-0-1&#34;&gt;Test results are in:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34; id=&#34;text-0-1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other week, the NY State &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nysed.gov/news/2014/state-education-department-releases-grades-3-8-assessment-results&#34;&gt;third through eight grade high stakes
test results&lt;/a&gt; were released. This was immediately followed by the usual spin an posturing.
The &lt;del&gt;reformers&lt;/del&gt; privatizers
would claim things like &#34;These charter schools did better than those
public schools&#34; while people like me would say &#34;Those charter schools
have different populations&#34; and so on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sec-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As you know, I&#39;ve never bought into the &#34;miracle school&#34; rot and my
friend and colleague &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/garyrubinstein&#34;&gt;Gary Rubinstein&lt;/a&gt; has done a great job at debunking
many of these schools with the so called &#34;secret sauce.&#34;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When the results came out, I got caught in the trap. I started to cite
the reasons why the charter schools with phenomenal results are not
really so wonderful. One can look at:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;org-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attrition rates
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test prep
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of back fill
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and more.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-1-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sec-1-1&#34;&gt;The Trap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34; id=&#34;text-1-1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what&#39;s the trap? We shouldn&#39;t even be acknowledging the validity
of these exams.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sec-2&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These are the 3-8th grade exams so I don&#39;t know that much about them,
but I do know that:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;org-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They&#39;re not made by teachers.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&#34;Cut scores&#34; are made after the fact - that is, the powers that be
can &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;arbitrarily&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; decide what passing is.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The exams &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;can&#39;t&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; be used to drive instruction.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exam questions are a tightly held secret.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are probably more, but I can&#39;t think of them now.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So exactly what is the value to the students and how do we know what
these tests are testing?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What it really comes down to is that we don&#39;t trust our teachers. If
we did, we wouldn&#39;t be giving statewide tests.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-2-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sec-2-1&#34;&gt;Closer to home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34; id=&#34;text-2-1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What I do know more about are regents exams and they&#39;re just as
ridiculous.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Public schools ship out their tests for grading while charters grade
their own. Any wonder why some charters report better results?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The exams also range from being reasonable assessments to
ridiculous. I remember one year there was a proof on the regents where
the question gave the statements and reasons and the student had to
put them in order. Another year, they had to match the reasons to the
statements. Both ridiculous. Other years, the proof questions are in
my opinion reasonable.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Just as with the 3-8 grade tests, teachers can&#39;t use these exams to drive
instruction because they&#39;re given at the end of the year but at least
the questions aren&#39;t sealed so the following year teacher has some
clue. On the other hand, the &#34;cut score&#34; is again made after the
fact. Ever wonder why test scores are usually up during election years?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sec-3&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And of course, in some cases, the tests just miss the point. At Stuy,
most of our ninth graders take a class that is usually called Geometry
and the state regents exam is called the geometry regents and is all
about Euclidean Geometry. The problem is, the course is really all
about logic and deductive reasoning using Euclidean Geometry as the
platform. This is of course missed on a standardized exam.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-sec-3-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sec-3-1&#34;&gt;The point:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34; id=&#34;text-3-1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The big point here is that as a nation we don&#39;t trust teachers. By the
time we get to the end of the semester, I know what my kids know and
generally how they will do on exams, projects, papers and the like. I
have a good idea as to if they&#39;ve mastered what I&#39;ve been trying to
teach.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Instead, large amounts of taxpayer dollars are going to private
companies, placing kids under great stress while narrowing their
curricular possibilities and using junk science to remove good teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>The new SAT - the more things stay the same</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-03-11-sat-the-same/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-03-11-sat-the-same/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
.large {font-size:200%}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;large&#34;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Plus ça change, plus c&#39;est la même chose&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The more things change, the more they stay the same.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Last week we heard all about the new SAT. Going back to 1600 points,
writing optional, and reworking the verbal section.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Immediate responses ranged from the usual fact that SAT doesn&#39;t correlate
with college success to the idea that the motive was not to improve
the test but rather to recapture market share from the ACT.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Personally, I&#39;m not a fan of the test but I do see the desire to have
some consistent measure across students and schools. While an &#34;A&#34;
might say something about perseverance and hard work, the value of
one school&#39;s &#34;A&#34; is not necessarily the same as the value from
another.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But that&#39;s not what I wanted to write about.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A big criticism of the SAT is the fact that it can be prepped for and
thus gives a huge advantage to students and families of means. The
test can be gamed, one can take prep courses, hire private tutors,
etc.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As I said at the top&amp;#x2026;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hot on the heels of the new SAT came the announcement that Khan
Academy will be offering &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&#34;&gt;free prep for the new SAT&lt;/a&gt;. That sounds
terrific.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I read it differently. I&#39;m all for free educational materials being
universally available, but if Khan Academy can indeed offer test prep
for the new SAT then so can everyone else and people of means can
and will avail themselves of the Khan Academy material plus a wealth of other
resources.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
So, new SAT but nothings changed.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Show me the data</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-01-26-show-me-the-data/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-01-26-show-me-the-data/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/show-me-the-data/showme.png&#34; alt=&#34;Show me the data&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time, I shared my thoughts on the recent coverage of AP CS statistics. Compiled and presented by &lt;a href=&#34;http://home.cc.gatech.edu/ice-gt/556&#34;&gt;Barbara Ericson&lt;/a&gt;
and later reported on all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize my point of view - yes there is a problem but some of the
highlighted data points can easily be shown to be irrelevant and
therefore can hurt the greater goal of access to great CS education for
all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This felt like the launching pad for a great class discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I presented this to my classes last week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and asked &amp;ldquo;what do you make of this?&amp;rdquo; I was curious what the classes
would say - they know I&amp;rsquo;m concerned with gender equity and know that
at Stuy we&amp;rsquo;ve done better than most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can say that I was very happy with their answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many took the test?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What states? How many African-Americans in &amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can we see the numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we started talking about the actual numbers. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing when you
actually look at the facts, truths come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was extremely pleased that my students saw right past the spin and
searched for the actual numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last post I explained why the stated claims - no girls in three
states, no blacks / Hispanics on 11 were horrible examples. Why focus
on these when it&amp;rsquo;s so easy to find better examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall 20% female test takers is an easy stat to point to, but
why point out Alaska&amp;rsquo;s lack of African-American test takers when it&amp;rsquo;s
statistically irrelevant. Why not point out that in NY, only 68
African-American test takers and 150 Hispanic (out of 1858 test).
Given that NY is about 16% black ad 17% Hispanic, we would have
expected around 300 from each group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, I&amp;rsquo;m delighted that my students are perceptive enough to
see past headlines, dig down to data, and make their own conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>At Last - CS Gender Equity in Multiple States!!!!!</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-01-11-badstats/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-01-11-badstats/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some buzz seems to have circulated on the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://home.cc.gatech.edu/ice-gt/556&#34;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; compiled by Barbara
Ericson on AP Computer Science test takers in 2013. In addition to going to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://home.cc.gatech.edu/ice-gt/556&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; there was a piece in  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/01/techs-gender-and-race-gap-starts-in-high-school/282966/&#34;&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2014/01/girls_african_americans_and_hi.html&#34;&gt;Education Week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some exciting results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In two states just as many girls passed the AP CS exam as guys!!!!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In two other states, just 6 more guys passed than girls!!!!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In yet another state, 100% of the girls passed, doing far better than the approximately 75% of the boys that passed!!!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow, we&amp;rsquo;re doing terrific.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, maybe not so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, I&amp;rsquo;m not saying anything false, just misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s the problem with the articles I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading on Barbara&amp;rsquo;s report. Take a look and you&amp;rsquo;ll see. The Education Week headline is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Girls, Blacks, or Hispanics Take AP Computer Science Exam in Some States&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both articles talk about how no girls took APCS in three states. Later
in the article, it clarifies the situation - Wyoming had no test
takers male or female, Mississippi had only 1, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t a passing
grade, and Montanna only 11 test takers total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find the headline disingenuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other tidbits like the fact that there were no hispanic test
takers from Alaska. No mention of the fact there were only 21 test
takers overall and that Alaska only has 6% of it&amp;rsquo;s population
identifying itself as hispanic (compared to a national number of 16%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly we have problems &amp;ndash; not enough students are exposed to good
computer science teaching and there certainly are under-represented
groups, but I feel that this type of reporting detracts from the
cause. All you have to do is look at the data and the credibility of
the reporter is shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see the same type of misleading remarks made by drop in programs
that claim to solve the problem &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;your kid will learn to make an app
in N weeks,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;our kids are better prepared for the AP exam than
kids who take the AP class.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s also all nonsense but these folks
are selling a product so at least it&amp;rsquo;s a little more understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;rsquo;s the question of using the AP exam as a measure in the
first place - I for one don&amp;rsquo;t feel that AP CS is a particularly good
course and I&amp;rsquo;m not sold on CS Principles as the answer either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, there are a lot of important inferences we can
make from the report and I encourage you to download the spreadsheet
and take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not enough students are being exposed to computer science and
not all groups are getting the same exposure, but when we spin the
data rather than illuminate it, we don&amp;rsquo;t really help our cause.&lt;/p&gt;

The other week I was invited by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/brandondiamond&#34;&gt;Brandon Diamond&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/IlanaSufrin&#34;&gt;Ilana Sufrin&lt;/a&gt;  to participate in &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/HuffPostLabs&#34;&gt;HuffPost Labs&lt;/a&gt; podcast - Floating Points.
&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ve known Brandon for a while and he&#39;s a really awesome guy. He&#39;s a
techie for sure but he also understands the importance of community
building. Brandon and Ilana (also awesome but I haven&#39;t known her as
long) are at HuffPost labs and also are working on important
initiatives like &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/HackerUnion&#34;&gt;Hacker Union&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
When they asked me to take part, I jumped. Here&#39;s the podcast:

      <title>Why I&#39;m no longer an effective teacher - part 2</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-10-25-effective-teacher-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-10-25-effective-teacher-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/2013/09/06/why_i_might_no_longer_be_an_effective_teacher.html#.UmhWzN__umg&#34;&gt;Earlier&lt;/a&gt;
I wrote about the new teacher evaluation system and why a teacher such
as myself might now be considered ineffective and two ineffectives in
a row can cost you your job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the New York City and New York State Departments of Education
are the departments that just keep on giving. Here&amp;rsquo;s the latest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This coming Wednesday, I won&amp;rsquo;t be teaching during my usual 8:00 to
10:15 block of three AP classes. Instead I&amp;rsquo;ll likely be
proctoring. Classes will be shorter and start at around 9:35.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will we be proctoring? A preliminary assessment. I, and in
fact all Stuy teachers, will be judged by how our students perform on
English and Math Regents exams vs how the DOE thinks they should
do. So, the DOE needs to issue a preliminary assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this Wednesday, instead of having their normal allocation of class
time, they will start a day taking an exam whose only purpose is to
evaluate (and some of us believe fire) teachers. So, since I don&amp;rsquo;t
teach English or Math, the closest I come to having some impact on the kids whos grades will determine my effectiveness will
be proctoring this exam. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s a fair measure of my value as a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that&amp;rsquo;s 40% of my evaluation, 60% comes from observation but
there&amp;rsquo;s a loophole. If the school doesn&amp;rsquo;t perform at a satisfactory
level, even if I ace the 60%, I will be deemed ineffective. Now, I
know I don&amp;rsquo;t have a large readership, but I&amp;rsquo;m guessing there are
enough of my former students out there that can vouch for the fact
that I do a pretty decent job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as to that 60%, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem much better. I&amp;rsquo;m reluctant to
say anything specific since I don&amp;rsquo;t know whose reading this, but let&amp;rsquo;s
just say, word on the street says that it&amp;rsquo;s more about filling out
lines on forms than actual education and teacher improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless things change soon, I expect good, experienced teachers to
start leaving in droves.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The College Board Smorgasbord -Don&#39;t Overfill Your Plate</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-10-23-spectator-ap/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-10-23-spectator-ap/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Each month, The Stuyvesant school paper - the Spectator invites a teacher to write a piece on, well, basically, whatever they want to. I did it this past month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a reposting of the piece. The original can be found on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://stuyspectator.org&#34;&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve got 10 periods of class and no lunch.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve got four APs.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Can I also take Great Books, Multivariate, Physics C, and Software Development?&amp;rdquo; The goal of a Stuyvesant student: take as many electives and AP classes as possible. Is that good? Is that smart? Probably not. I&amp;rsquo;m just a teacher, yes, but I&amp;rsquo;m also a Stuyvesant graduate and parent, so I&amp;rsquo;ve wrestled with this issue from all sides. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about AP classes, student schedules, and the big picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a Stuyvesant student in the mid-&amp;rsquo;80s, we had AP classes, but they weren&amp;rsquo;t really a big deal. I took two, Calculus and Computer Science. My wife, then a classmate, didn&amp;rsquo;t take any. Some kids took a third, and four was a rarity. You took AP English if you were really into English, AP Chemistry if that was your thing. The school day consisted of eight periods, starting at 9:00 and ending at 3:00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to the early to mid &amp;rsquo;90s, when I was a young teacher. The Stuyvesant day was still eight periods. Students wanted more AP classes, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t out of control. Soon after, we adopted what is known as a split schedule. Students were either in classes from periods one to eight, or from two through nine, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t last. Like empty space in a closet, students looked at that additional period as an extra slot to fill, and we were more than happy to oblige. This ultimately led to today. To get into a top college, students feel the need to take a full schedule with as many AP classes as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to recognize the hypocrisy that we&amp;rsquo;re getting from colleges: &amp;ldquo;Take more AP classes, though we&amp;rsquo;re giving you less credit for them.&amp;rdquo; The more &amp;ldquo;selective&amp;rdquo; schools want a transcript filled with APs, but good luck getting college credit from them. You&amp;rsquo;ll be lucky to get placement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also important to recognize the lack of value offered by AP classes. We teach AP Computer Science at Stuyvesant, and I can tell you that the AP syllabus, as defined by the College Board, is weak at best. What&amp;rsquo;s more, the College Board is starting a new AP Computer Science class that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even consider college-level. Now, we teach rigorous, college-level computer science, a superset of the AP class, but we end up fighting to get around the limitations of the AP curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years ago, when graphing calculators first became commonplace, I decided to work my way through a released AP Calculus A exam. The rules were that I could only use common sense, the calculator, and precalculus techniques, that is, I had to pretend I knew no calculus. When all was said and done, this technique earned a 3, a passing grade. How strong is the College Board standard when one can &amp;ldquo;pass&amp;rdquo; with no knowledge of the subject? We can also look at our English classes at Stuyvesant. It&amp;rsquo;s also well known that classes such as Great Books and Creative Nonfiction are as rigorous as or more rigorous than classes following the College Board AP syllabus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Advanced Placement isn&amp;rsquo;t all it&amp;rsquo;s cracked up to be; it&amp;rsquo;s a brand name, and we buy into it. But we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t. Buying into the hype has led countless students to sign up for a course &amp;ldquo;to get another AP.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s the worst reason to take a course. Take AP Computer Science if you are interested in the subject or if you think it will give you a skill set for the future. Same with the others. Don&amp;rsquo;t take advanced courses to fill a schedule. You won&amp;rsquo;t enjoy it, you won&amp;rsquo;t be happy, and you won&amp;rsquo;t get a lot out of it. Part of the beauty of the high school experience is that you get a taste of each subject before you have to select AP classes. By the time you get there, you should have some idea of your interests. Don&amp;rsquo;t take APs for the sake of taking APs. If you have room and aren&amp;rsquo;t passionate about the available AP choices, take another elective and try something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-period day is another part of the AP madness. Now, a 10-period day isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily bad. My daughter Batya did it and my son is doing it now. A key point, though, is that two of their classes were and are chorus and band, respecitvely, classes with little out-of-class workload, which, in fact, provide a break of sorts during the day. While our music classes require focus and effort, it&amp;rsquo;s not the same as, say, a math class. Think of it as cross-training. Their only elective on top of these was AP Computer Science. but since they both enjoy the subject, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t work for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my kids, the electives that made a 10-period day are what made the day fun and worthwhile. Now, that&amp;rsquo;s a little bit of an overstatement, as both Batya and Natan really enjoyed some of their required classes, but I think you all know what I mean. The problem comes when you add classes because you feel you need an additional workload. We take more classes but end up learning less. Even with an eight-period day: take out one for lunch and one for gym, that&amp;rsquo;s six. If each teacher gives forty minutes of homework a day, that&amp;rsquo;s four hours. Add two classes and you&amp;rsquo;re over five, and we know that many teachers give more than forty minutes a night. I believe that if Stuyvesant students take less classes, they&amp;rsquo;d actually learn more, because they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be cramming day after day, trying to meet unrealistic deadlines. Rather, they could really explore fewer subjects in a more meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t take a course just to take a course, but what about the AP designation? To start, I see two types of AP courses. Those that are a drop-in replacement for a regular course, such as the history and English courses, and those that are extras, such as AP Computer Science, Physics, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t really speak to the drop-in classes, but I can for the extras: I&amp;rsquo;d just love to teach &amp;ldquo;rigorous, college-level&amp;rdquo; classes. Let&amp;rsquo;s drop the AP designation. For computer science, we could create study guides for those who want to take the test, but we could dump the nonsense from our curriculum and make it even stronger. I know this flies in the face of our test-taking mentality, but we&amp;rsquo;re Stuyvesant. Colleges know our courses and our teachers. If anyone can do it, we can. Let&amp;rsquo;s be leaders and not buy into the nonsense that the College Board is selling us. The Ethical Culture Fieldston School did this a few years ago, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have hurt them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AP class-crunch culture didn&amp;rsquo;t happen over night. It developed like a prisoner&amp;rsquo;s dilemma out of control: &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re taking more AP classes, so I have to.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s re-examine not only AP classes, but all our classes. What does it mean to be a Stuyvesant student? Should we have a semester of this and a year of that or three years of something else? Am I right that less is more, or is the current system working? Let&amp;rsquo;s get some people together to look at this question. Let&amp;rsquo;s evaluate all our requirements and how we do things. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk to students, teachers, parents, and, maybe most importantly, alums who have the perspective of time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why I might no longer be an effective teacher</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-09-06-why_i_might_no_longer_be_an_effective_teacher/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-09-06-why_i_might_no_longer_be_an_effective_teacher/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So here we are starting the new year and NY City is rolling out its new teacher evaluation system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was all over the news last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the state imposed the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city hailed the new plan as a way to fire under-performing teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UFT president hailed the plan as something that &amp;ldquo;is designed to help teachers improve their skills&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My take? All three parties have thrown the students and teachers under the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to think of myself as a pretty effective teacher. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this plan works with me in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;40% of a teacher&amp;rsquo;s evaluation is based on standardized tests, 60% from a supervisors evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the 40% first. It&amp;rsquo;s broken down into 20% state test
results and 20% local results.  Suppose I taught regents math. 20% of
my evaluation would be the city&amp;rsquo;s assessment of how my students
performed on the math regents. Since we don&amp;rsquo;t have any local measures,
the other 20% would be based on the lowest performing third of my
students regents results and how they performed vs what the city
expected of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does this mean and what are the problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many sources indicate that these standardized tests aren&amp;rsquo;t even good measures of student achievement and they should &lt;strong&gt;NEVER&lt;/strong&gt; be used as a means of teacher assessment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a way they&amp;rsquo;re using the same data twice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By focusing 20% of the lowest performing segment, they&amp;rsquo;re telling teachers to teach to the bottom of the class pushing NY Ed to the lowest common denominator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This will  &lt;strong&gt;CLEARLY&lt;/strong&gt; encourage teaching to the test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem here is that while the city and state claim they
want accountability and transparency, they only want to extend that to
teachers (that is, publishing teacher scores). The methods they use to
convert a teachers actual scores to their 40% score is hidden. They
can work the same &amp;ldquo;magic&amp;rdquo; they work on standard tests. Look at the raw
scores, decide what they want the results to be and then create or
adjust the mapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this is already a ridiculous system, &lt;strong&gt;but it gets worse&lt;/strong&gt;. I
don&amp;rsquo;t teach regents classes. I teach computer science. So, my 40% will
be based on the school&amp;rsquo;s regents results. That is, they will look at
the results of all the students taking regents exams at Stuyvesant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m being evaluated based on students who I probably never taught&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the other 60%?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s basically classroom observation. I&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to
always have fair supervisors, but in this system, a vindictive
supervisor could easily railroad a teacher. Even with a fair supervisor, there are problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York is using the Danielson Framework for observations. Each
teacher will be awarded a score between 1 and 4 in each of 22 areas or
competencies. A great teacher that doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover all of the Danielson
bases could easily be rated lower than a run of the mill one that
does. Some of the best teachers I know could rate either reasonably
highly or at the low end of the scale depending on how their
supervisor interprets the competencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day, we all watched a video of a demo lesson of a math
class. The evaluators in the video and then Danielson gushed over the
lesson. Everyone in the room felt that the lesson was OK, but had real
problems. Our issue was over the rigor of the lesson &amp;ndash; it was a math
lesson. Both the evaluator and Danielson felt it was rigorous and
appropriate based on the fact that the students were saying things
that the evaluator didn&amp;rsquo;t understand. As a computer science teacher in
a math department, my supervisors have never had a background in my
field. This is also true in small schools where there aren&amp;rsquo;t
departmental supervisors. In any event, if you have a fair supervisor,
great - if not - look out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does that leave us? Teachers of my generation see the writing
on the wall. For the first time, I&amp;rsquo;m seriously considering other
career paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first supervisor told me a long time ago that when he went into
class to observe a teacher, he asked himself one question: &amp;ldquo;is
learning going on?&amp;rdquo; He knew that teaching could take on numerous forms
but by working from that base question, he could evaluate and work with any teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should really be that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>That One Inspirational Curriculum</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-08-07-that_one_inspirational_curriculum/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-08-07-that_one_inspirational_curriculum/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard a lot of people talk about curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We need a curriculum that works for everyone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If we had a good curriculum, we could get CS in the schools.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rsquo;t you just take someone else&amp;rsquo;s curriculum and scale things out?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People miss the point. In my twenty some odd years as an educator and
my forty five  as a human (including 18 as a parent), I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt;
heard someone talk about &lt;em&gt;that one inspirational curriculum&lt;/em&gt; that made
all the difference in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not about the curriculum, it&amp;rsquo;s about the teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collegeboard web site provides some sample AP Computer Science A
syllabi. In them, you&amp;rsquo;ll find things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mergesort&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students will gain additional practice with arrays as they explore the
nontrivial task of merging two sorted lists. In addition, students
will once again see a comparison between a recursive and
nonrecursive solution to an algorithm&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, this covers what has to be taught and what will be on the
AP exam but it really misses the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I blogged about a few lessons I taught last year. One here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/2013/03/23/Who_won_the_election-Quadratic_to_Linear_Time.html#.UgLhfN__umg&#34;&gt;http://cestlaz.github.io/2013/03/23/Who_won_the_election-Quadratic_to_Linear_Time.html#.UgLhfN__umg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/2012/12/17/layers-of-a-lesson.html#.UgLhi9__umg&#34;&gt;http://cestlaz.github.io/2012/12/17/layers-of-a-lesson.html#.UgLhi9__umg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first topic might have a line in the syllabus saying: Finding the mode
of a data set and have a description talking about using lists. None of
the beauty of the topic is captured in the syllabus. That&amp;rsquo;s all the
teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar things can be said about the second lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NY State Common Core Math Curriculum does a little better (not
that I&amp;rsquo;m sold on it) - for example, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t just say &amp;ldquo;Quadratic
Formula&amp;rdquo; but at least says that it should be derived. It&amp;rsquo;s better, but
not by much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, Curricula are least common denominator documents and
centering education around them rather than teachers is a huge
mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great teacher can inspire and mask a bad curriculum. The reverse isn&amp;rsquo;t true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, a bad curriculum can do more to constrain a good teacher than
a good curriculum can help a bad teacher to inspire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve met a few CS teachers that really
impressed me as teachers but not course designers. I found there
courses and curricula sorely lacking, but the fact that they had the
gift allowed them to truly inspire their students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is not to say that good class design and curriculum
aren&amp;rsquo;t important &amp;ndash; those same teachers would be even better with a
better course framework but it has to start with the teaching talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I writing about this? Because more and more we see the
marginalization of teachers. We see the TFA 5 week training model or
summer workshops to create or train new teachers. The theory seems to
be, it we script the teaching, this will be sufficient. It might be,
if the goal is to get by standardized tests, but it won&amp;rsquo;t be if the
goal is to have an inspirational knowledgeable teacher in front of our
kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that we have to start with the talent and develop the curriculum
around it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gender stats</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-07-05-gender-stats/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-07-05-gender-stats/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;People keep asking me about how we&amp;rsquo;re doing with respect to gender
balance and CS education at Stuy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than writing the same email again and again, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d summarize things here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve done rather well at Stuy. I might write more in depth at some
point in the future but we don&amp;rsquo;t dumb anything down and we aren&amp;rsquo;t
patronizing. I think much of the success can be attributed to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awesome teachers that really know their CS and are great teachers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teachers that buy into the same insanity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well designed courses in a well designed sequence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A well designed &lt;strong&gt;required&lt;/strong&gt; intro course where young ladies can see that this stuff is cool and women are just as good at it as men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did I mention awesome teachers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An atmosphere where everyone feels accepted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important fact to consider here is that Stuyvesant is only &lt;strong&gt;40%
female&lt;/strong&gt; so our numbers are actually even better than they
appear. Also, we&amp;rsquo;ve typically offered AP CS to 150 students and our
senior classes to between 60 and 120 students. Even with these
numbers, we&amp;rsquo;re always over subscribed (it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to have 300 - 400 students out of a class of about 800 students request AP Computer Science).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might wonder why I included the C Physics numbers. Of all the
other STEM AP classes, C Physics is probably the most analagous to AP
Comp Sci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both are electives that are traditionally male dominated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both follow a required class in an earlier grade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neither is a graduation requirement,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but C Physics can fulfill one of Stuyvesant&amp;rsquo;s senior science elective requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t look at Calculus because at
Stuy, Calc is just &amp;ldquo;the next math course&amp;rdquo; so just students take it
regardless of gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another difference is that AP CS is offered mostly to juniors and that
the students have additional classes they can take in their senior
year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that Stuy CS outperforms the national gender breakdown while
Stuy C Physics doesn&amp;rsquo;t. The point is that it&amp;rsquo;s not a Stuy thing, it&amp;rsquo;s
something we&amp;rsquo;re doing in our little CS corner of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting morsel is that we recently had our &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/2013/06/27/Demo_Night.html#.UdXzVaBtw7w&#34;&gt;demo night&lt;/a&gt;. There
were 13 combined students on the four winning teams. 6 were young
ladies so women were in no way dominated in our most advanced class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there you have it. What&amp;rsquo;s going on with gender and CS at Stuy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Evaluating Teachers - Evaluating schools</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-05-09-evaluating_teachers/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-05-09-evaluating_teachers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buzz word is &amp;ldquo;accountability.&amp;rdquo; Why are teachers special? Why don&amp;rsquo;t
they feel they need to be evaluated like other professionals? Why do
they feel they need a &amp;ldquo;job for life?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the job for life line is nonsense &amp;ndash; teachers have tenure,
but that&amp;rsquo;s just due process - not a guarantee of a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends in the private sector ask &amp;ldquo;if a teacher is doing a good job,
why do they need tenure? In the private sector as long as you&amp;rsquo;re
producing, you&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing to worry about.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, first I dispute that last sentence. second, K-12 education isn&amp;rsquo;t
the real world. It&amp;rsquo;s rife with stories of administrators that go after
teachers for no apparent reason. Why? Because accountability doesn&amp;rsquo;t
mean accountability - it means we can fire teachers at will. No one
wants accountability to apply to anyone except the ground troops. I
don&amp;rsquo;t have an exact attribution, but Mayor Bloomberg is frequently
quoted as stating &amp;ldquo;If parent&amp;rsquo;s don&amp;rsquo;t like the way I run the schools,
they can boo me at parades.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, the powers that be state that teacher accountability
revolves around flawed &amp;ldquo;value added&amp;rdquo; metrics but other bloggers such as Gary
Rubintein have already done a great job debunking that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-solution&#34;&gt;The Solution:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to simplify. There&amp;rsquo;s a better way. Let&amp;rsquo;s start by
making the principals accountable. Bottom line is that they&amp;rsquo;re
responsible for a school&amp;rsquo;s success. If the school doesn&amp;rsquo;t cut the
mustard, then they&amp;rsquo;re out. But, how do we measure this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High Schools&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Schools, Snake Oil, and the SOTU</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-02-14-schools-snake-oil-and-the-sotu/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-02-14-schools-snake-oil-and-the-sotu/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I had the privilege of attending my second live State of the City
address. Mayor Bloomberg didn&amp;rsquo;t spend as much time on education as he
did at last year&amp;rsquo;s address but he did take a moment to give a shout out
to charter schools. It gets old hearing the same false story about how
charters are better than public schools. At least we have people
like &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Gary
Rubinstein&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; and &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Diane
Ravitch&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; trying to set the record straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s worse, when public schools are lauded, it seems that the ones
given the spotlight are selling the same snake oil as the charter
schools. Gary Rubinstein recently posted on one
case &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;here&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
but I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week President Obama gave his State of the Union address. He
gave a shout out to P-Tech, a new school with a six year (9-14)
program. It&amp;rsquo;s a partnership with IBM and students completing the six
years will have the opportunity to interview for a job at IBM (note,
that&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to interview, not an actual job). When I heard
the shout out, my stomach sank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P-Tech is being hailed as a new model for public education but for me,
it raised serious questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, when did we start considering a school, under two years in
existence, a success. The education reformers love to talk data yet
here&amp;rsquo;s the President, lauding a school that&amp;rsquo;s collected no data. I
personally feel that P-Tech is more style than substance but we won&amp;rsquo;t
know either way for another six to ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, let&amp;rsquo;s think about the possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best case is a student selects P-Tech in the 8th grade and leaves
six years later with a solid job at IBM. What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, since NY dismantled all the large schools, all that&amp;rsquo;s left are
small &amp;ldquo;themed&amp;rdquo; schools. Since they&amp;rsquo;re small, they don&amp;rsquo;t offer a wide
range of electives, only ones in their theme. So, a youngster has
to &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;know&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; that they want to do in 8th grade. Should a thirteen
year old be forced to make a decision like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another question is will there be quality jobs waiting for these
kids? With more and more computing moving to the cloud, will there be
jobs waiting for these kids in NY six years after they begin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have numerous other questions about P-Tech, but I really want to
focus on one more here and it&amp;rsquo;s one that surprised me when I started
thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not really a commentary on P-Tech but more on &amp;ldquo;early college&amp;rdquo; and
what we consider college level work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the President&amp;rsquo;s shout out, I decided to see if P-Tech would have
something to say about it. I ended up reading a piece by Principal
Rashid Davis where he talked about fifteen of his students earning a
&amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; or better in a college level course at City Tech, a CUNY school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first reaction was &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s really cool.&amp;rdquo; Then I started to
think. My daughter&amp;rsquo;s graduating high school this year. She&amp;rsquo;s very
smart and capable and has always achieved academically. I wondered,
how would I feel if the courses she takes next year are at a level of
rigor such that she could have succeeded as a high school freshman? My
answer was that I would be very disappointed in the college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She backed me up by saying that she felt, looking back at all the AP
courses she has taken, she probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready for most of them in
her freshman high school year. My own observations back this up. At
Stuyvesant, we teach an enhanced version of the old AB AP Computer
Science curriculum. We teach this to students in their junior
year. Years ago, I had some sophomores enrolled and while a few
succeeded, most of the time, the kids just weren&amp;rsquo;t ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to say anything demeaning to Mr. Davis&amp;rsquo; students here,
but if our colleges are teaching courses in which a typical high school
freshman can excel, then  maybe they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be college level courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never really believed in the &amp;ldquo;early college&amp;rdquo; model anyway. We
teach A.P. computer science at Stuyvesant but most of our CS sequence
is designed to complement what our graduates will face in
college. We&amp;rsquo;re giving them the missing pieces. Yes, there is overlap,
and I do believe we have a similar level of rigor but we strive to
give the kids something they won&amp;rsquo;t get otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, at the end of the day what do we have? Plenty of snake
oil to go around.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Who&#39;s missing from the picture</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2012-12-12-whos-missing-from-the-picture/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, it&#39;s Computer Science Education Week. Full of rah rah events and everyone&#39;s gung ho about teaching computer science.


&lt;p&gt;
You all know that CS Ed is what I&#39;ve dedicated most of my life to and
maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m &#34;not feeling it&#34; in terms of CS Ed Week. Let me
explain.

&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday there was
a &lt;a href=&#34;http://csedweek.eventbrite.com/&#34;&gt;Twitter Conversation&lt;/a&gt;
led by a &#34;national panel of thought leaders in the field.&#34; Click on
the link. If it&#39;s still active you can see the list of &#34;facilitators&#34;
they were highligthing.

&lt;p&gt;
I know some of the people and heard of some of the names and I do
respect some of them. The problem is that if you look down the list
you&#39;ll notice something missing. There are &lt;b&gt;zero&lt;/b&gt; K-12 teachers on the
list. None, not one. Some of the people on the list taught in the
past. I don&#39;t know how long and in what capacity, but there are no
current teachers. None of us current teachers are worthy &#34;thought leaders?&#34;

&lt;p&gt;
This is a big danger with respect to CS Education. There are a small
handful of us on the ground, actually teaching, with a strong CS
background and with &lt;b&gt;real&lt;/b&gt; successes.

&lt;p&gt;
I know there aren&#39;t many of us. People with a strong CS background
that have decided to become career teachers but there are a
few. Stuyvesant barely had a single AP CS class when I started teaching
here and now we have nine teachers. We&#39;ve exposed and inspired student
after student to CS. People dismiss us -- &#34;You&#39;re Stuyvesant, you have
gifted kids.&#34; We do have great kids, but then why haven&#39;t programs like
ours sprouted up at other high performing schools? I&#39;d like to think
I&#39;ve had something to do with our success.

&lt;p&gt;
So, here we have an incredibly successful program but no one wants to
engage us in terms of improving and developing CS Education. I know a
handful of other great CS Educators around the country. They&#39;ve
similarly felt ignored, rebuffed, and unengaged.

&lt;p&gt;
I think the problem is twofold. First, our society has taken to
blaming teachers for society&#39;s woes and places little value in what we
do. Second, education is the one field that everyone thinks they&#39;re an
expert in. You went to school so obviously you&#39;re qualified to
teach. There&#39;s a huge difference in what I do and with giving a few
guest talks.

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ve tried to engage NYC&#39;s DOE a number of times. According to Mayor
Bloomberg, the Academy for Software Engineering (afse) was my
brianchild but the DOE didn&#39;t pay any regard to my early suggestions,
I had no voice in the development process and when push came to shove,
the DOE decided to hire a consultant with a track record far more
limited than mine or my team&#39;s. I finally gave up asking how I would
be involved.

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m also a CSTA member. In fact, I&#39;m a NY State CSTA Advocate.  I&#39;ve
reached out for help and to offer it over the years but responses
have been lukewarm at best.

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m here, my colleagues are here. We want to do more but apparently
educators need not apply.

&lt;p&gt;
Back to the Twitter Conversation. Here are just a few tweets and some
comments:

&lt;p&gt;
Tweet: &lt;blockquote class=&#34;blockquote&#34;&gt;
More and more online resources like @codecademy mean computing clubs
without a highly trained CS Teacher are possible. #csedweek
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comment&lt;blockquote&gt; I like codecademy and like the fact that they&#39;re engaging
educators, but when I read this it screams to me &#34;doesn&#39;t get it.&#34; I
just taught a lesson today that on the surface seems like it could be
covered by some automated service but there&#39;s so much going on between
the lines.

It&#39;s like saying &#34;we don&#39;t need history teachers, let them read a book or watch a movie.&#34; If the tweeter said that when commenting on teaching history, the tweeter would be laughed out of the room.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Tweet: &lt;blockquote class=&#34;blockquote&#34;&gt;
YES! RT @ruthef If we want CS teachers, we need to increase teacher
pay and partner with industry to get tech into the classroom!
#csedweek &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Comment&lt;blockquote&gt; It has more to do with the lack of respect payed to
teachers. No matter how much you raise pay, it won&#39;t compete with
private industry. Also, what makes a great tech person doesn&#39;t
necessarily make a great teacher. You need that rare union of both.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Tweet: &lt;blockquote class=&#34;blockquote&#34;&gt;
One of the problems we have with CS Education is that not
enough research is bring done. Not teaching or results. #CSEdWeek
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Comment&lt;blockquote&gt; Research? How about talking to the teachers on the ground and
helping build more of them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Tweet: &lt;blockquote class=&#34;blockquote&#34;&gt;
Encouragement works. There are amazing tech girls @superandomness
@temiri Just awarded 310 outstanding girls http://www.ncwit.org/blog
#CSEDWeek
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Comment&lt;blockquote&gt; Yes, but who are you encouraging. I&#39;ve had many NCWIT winners
come from my program. Usually, the most deserving young ladies lose
out to young ladies who are lesser candidates but better essay
writers. In any event, we&#39;ve already done the hard work at Stuy
inspiring the kids. By the time NCWIT gives the awards, we&#39;ve already
done the hard work. How about helping us rather than taking credit for
our work.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are those of us out there who have succeeded in spite of a lack of support. Why not engage us, use as as models, or at the very least, study us and decide that we don&#39;t know what we&#39;re doing.
&lt;p&gt;
So, where does this leave us?

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m still fighting the fight. I&#39;m still trying to get NYC and
Stuyvesant to recognize CS as a department and help me train teachers
and build programs around the city, but I&#39;m not hopeful.

&lt;p&gt;
Meanwhile the train lurches forward.

&lt;p&gt;
About a year ago I was speaking to a friend of mine who&#39;s well placed
in the tech world. He had just met with a number of movers and shakers
about CS and technical education. His take away: if we go the way
they&#39;re looking to go, maybe we&#39;re better off not doing anything.

&lt;p&gt;
I share that fear. No one&#39;s pushing for CS Education harder than I am
but I fear that we will get &#34;CS Ed&#34; as opposed to CS, much like many
of us feel &#34;Math Ed&#34; has hurt math education in our country.

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ll close with the sentiment shared with my by another high level
tech person after another meeting with movers and shakers. He told me:

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&#34;There are a small handful of successes, like you at Stuy, but
basically, we&#39;re f*cked.&#34;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
