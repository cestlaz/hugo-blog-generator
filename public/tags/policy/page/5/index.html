        Earlier today I read this post by Eliot Horowitz, founder and CTO of MongoDB.  Eliot titled the post &#34;Innovate vs Appropriate&#34; and talks about the importance of knowing when to come up with something new vs when to use the accepted tool, technique, or method. Eliot, of course is discussing this as it applies to MongoDB and it&#39;s well worth a read but it got me thinking about the ever popular need to &#34;disrupt&#34; education.

        Yesterday I read over Hillary&#39;s briefing on her initiative on Technology and Innovation.  A lot of it sounds good but, at least for the education piece, I have my doubts. My feeling is that she&#39;s pretty much aligned with the current administration education wise and the current administration has been as bad if not worse than the previous with respect to public education.  While I have issues with some of the education pieces and very much like some of the others, I don&#39;t want to get into that today.

        I spent the last couple of days attending Personal Democracy Forum 2016, described on their landing site as:   The worldâ€™s leading conference exploring and analyzing technology&#39;s impact on politics, government, and society.   That&#39;s the reason why I haven&#39;t posted my latest Emacs video.  PDF is a great conference and raised a huge number of important issues.

At their core, Math Circles are math outreach and enrichment programs. I&#39;m most familiar with the New York Math Circle. I&#39;m friends with many of their teachers and organizers and my son took part in their summer program for a couple of years.

        I haven&#39;t been teaching this past semester. That&#39;s why I haven&#39;t been writing much about lessons. I miss working with students but that will resume in the fall and this semester has allowed me to get a jump on new projects.  It&#39;s also allowed me to look at some student issues from a bit of a distance.  One issue that keeps coming up is cheating.  Some of it, classroom cheating.

        Some good points in the Facebook comments on my last post. One notable comment was the fact that many teachers wouldn&#39;t be able to gain the traction needed to teach CS without an AP designation. This is true but also sad that we&#39;ve awarded such educational authority to a private company that&#39;s accountable to no one. Schools should run courses because they&#39;re good for kids not specifically because they&#39;re AP.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        Yesterday, I ranted on about the College Board. This led to a Facebook hosted discussion which got me thinking a little more:  Advanced Placement exams basically exist because we don&#39;t trust our high school teachers.  I usually use phrases like &#34;society doesn&#39;t trust&#34; but let&#39;s personalize it this time â€“ for parents, think about whether or not you trust your kids teachers? Do you a large private, unaccountable organization more?

        Edit:   Just a brief note to clarify a couple of things. As indicated in the comments, this post isn&#39;t about what&#39;s appropriate for HS CS. It&#39;s more about what kids have after they finish their education - be it high school, college, code school, or other.  Some of my thoughts are the results of pondering on the exacerbations of friends after interviewing people for entry level positions.

        The difficulties I&#39;ve had with the city and DOE are pretty well documented by now.  Today I&#39;m going to tell you about my latest dealings with DOE and how they prevented my team from bringing free quality CS education to city students.  CSTUY&#39;s not running SHIP, its summer program this year.  That&#39;s not something I&#39;m happy about but part of me knew it might happen. What did surprise me, although it shouldn&#39;t have, was the role that the NYC DOE played in preventing it from happening.

I&#39;ve never played well with the establishment.  It&#39;s ok though. For every honoree that I can point to and say &#34;there&#39;s a master teacher,&#34; there are half a dozen who you look at just know that it was more about politics and connections than about teaching chops.
