        div.center text-align:center;    This post is in response to an email thread on the NYTM mailing list. I mentioned how the NYC DOE refused to even look at our program at Stuy let alone support us and help us get to more kids.  Rather than pollute an email thread, I said I'd write up the story here.  I've been at the CS Ed game for a long time.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        div.center {text-align:center;}    We talked about setting kids up to fail in math. What about CS?  Well, it's a little subtler.  I started thinking about this after a conversation with one of my graduates about Harvard's famous CS50. Since that conversation, I've spoken to a number of my kids that have gone through CS50 and most seem to say the same things: They don't really teach anything  The kids rely on a group member who already knows stuff or will learn all the stuff on their own  If it weren't for my StuyCS background my group would have really struggled.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   "Four in ten NYC high schools don't offer Algebra 2 and both Physics and Chemistry."  At least that's what this article and linked report say.  The implication is clear - many of our students don't have the opportunity to advance in math and the sciences.  The truth though is much more disturbing.  The reason why these schools aren't offering Algebra 2 is very simple - the kids aren't ready for it.

        This image has been making its rounds.  Largest expansion is pretty clear but are the largest gain in 3+ scores mean a higher percentage of 3+ scores or merely the result of more test takers?  I'm curious, but that's not what I wanted to talk about.  Looking at our AP results from this year we had:   For the past two years we've been allowed to run 7 sections of AP Computer Science with about 30 kids per class.

You'd get a room full of math teachers, each teacher would take a problem or two and we'd work through class envelopes.

Tweet 7:   and you have to believe in yourself and your idea or nobody else ever will   resonated with me, not just in terms of a startup idea, but with respect to one's passion.
