        div.center {text-align:center;}   I was brought up on Gilberg and Sullvan. My father, who always wanted to be an opera singer sang with LOOM back in the day and there was always classical music playing. Either from the Hi Fi or my father singing.  Recently, there's been a kerfufle over what was to be NYGASP's production of Mikado.  My son, Natan wrote a terrific blog post on it and the suspension of belief in opera.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   .photo {width:60%;}   Last post was a little heavy so just a short fun one for today.  "Just another day at StuyCS." That was the subject of the email Brian sent with the photo above. What's going on?  We're working on advanced JavaScript while also looking at Backbone.js.  Now, as sometimes happens, Batya, while in her CS class up at college, decided to open up a Google chat with me.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        div.center {text-align:center;}    I'm a born and bred New Yorker and more and more I'm lamenting what the city's becoming.  New York used to be a collection of neighborhoods. Yes, we were the city that never slept, but there were scores of mom and pop stores, sole proprieterships. You could become a "regular." I'm reminded of Tom Shachman's book Around the Block which looks at the businesses around a single NYC block, mostly all gone now.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        div.center {text-align:center;}   I just read Alfred Thompson's predictions for next year. I was going to leave a comment but since it would have gotten somewhat long winded, I thought I'd comment in a post of my own.  If you haven't read Alfred's post yet, check it out: http://blog.acthompson.net/2015/01/computer-science-education-predictions.html On more states allowing CS to count for a graduation requirement:  Alfred's probably right but I'm leery. Sure, it could end up terrific but I could see a number of ways this could play out badly.

We've had an interesting December break dynamic in our household for the past few years. My son, Natan is very much into his music, both as a performer and a composer. A few years ago we discovered KlezKamp. It spoke to both Natan and Devorah.

Over the summer, Mariya, Kachun, and Stella, all writers for Stuy's Spectator worte an article that chronicled StuyCS. It's a really nice piece.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   Last night, I attended the Dream It, Code It, Win It awards.  I'd actually write up the event but Fred Wilson's already done a better job at that than I could: http://avc.com/2014/05/dream-it-and-code-it/  As Fred stated on his blog, it's a real shame that the high schooler's didn't get to show off their work but it was great to see that there were entries from a variety of schools including The Academy for Software Engineering and The Young Women's Leadership Academy.

        Spent the past few days at the Tapia Conference in Seattle.
The Tapia conference is billed as a &ldquo;Celebration of Diversity in Computing.&rdquo; The bulk of the attendees seemed to be students. Undergrads and grads. The undergrads were mostly juniors and seniors, but a bunch of freshmen and sophomores were there as well. Of course there were faculty members to join them as well as people from industry.
What was I doing there?

    <div class="content post-summary">
        This past Monday I, like may woke to hear about the passing of Pete Seeger. Ten days earlier we were up at Symphony Space for the &ldquo;Woody&rsquo;s Children&rdquo; 45th Anniversary Concert. Pete was supposed to perform but was ill. At 94 years of age, I wondered if the end was near. I was at the concert with my family as well as with my buddy Ben. Fitting since Ben and I grew up on Pete&rsquo;s music while many of our peers did not.

        I&rsquo;ve never been one for New Year&rsquo;s resolutions.
If I&rsquo;m working on something specific, I might set a goal to finish it, but the idea of goals for a year never struck a chord with me.
It&rsquo;s one of the things that I find absurd about the current teacher rating system - I have to decided on my three goals for the year. I always have one goal with respect to my profession - to be better at it.
