      <title>Scared teachers can&#39;t teach and scared students won&#39;t learn</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/scared-teachers-scared-students/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been reading a lot of takes on NYC schools reopening. We&amp;#39;ve had
daily conversations about it with our summer teachers but
conversations abound on Facebook, Twitter and everywhere else.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many salient points have been raised - given the DOE&amp;#39;s track record,
can they make things safe and will they? Can they be trusted? Given
that any policy needs all players to follow the rules - students,
teachers, and staff how can that ever happen? What happens when a
parent want&amp;#39;s their kid in school but wants to opt out of wearing a
mask? What happens if kids just straight out refuse? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then there&amp;#39;s logistics and teacher workload - even if you have fewer
kids in school there will still be far too many on subway platforms
and who knows if they&amp;#39;ll be masked outside of the school
building. What about bathrooms and class changeovers? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then there&amp;#39;s that little matter of teachers having to now, instead of
just five classes which is already too many could effectively be asked
to teach double or more - the result of splitting their classes into
live and remote. There&amp;#39;s also the way they want the live teaching to
work which basically reduces the in person instruction to a remote
experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What isn&amp;#39;t being talked about is discomfort and fear. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From what I can tell, a lot of teachers are afraid for their
health. Not mildly concerned, afraid. I don&amp;#39;t blame them. I would be
too. I&amp;#39;m betting a lot of students are also afraid of going back.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How effective is a teacher going to be when they feel that any
interaction or even too much time in the wrong space might get them
sick or worse. Same for students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After 9/11 we relocated to Brooklyn Tech. It was surreal
and weird but it felt fine. I taught, they learned. We were pushed
back to Stuy too early. You could still smell the smoke from the
smoldering wreckage of ground zero and there were concerns about the
air quality. It was on a lot of our minds all the time we were down on
Chambers street. It was certainly on my mind. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know that I wasn&amp;#39;t teaching at anything resembling my normal level
and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure the kids weren&amp;#39;t learning nearly as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Eventually, the smoke cleared, they cleaned the building again (and
stole a lot of valuables) and set up sensors that at least seemed more
accurate and after a period of time we felt normal or at least close
enough.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, that was from a single event not an ongoing pandemic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t believe for one second that NYC schools will be safe for
teachers and students in the fall but even if they were, if teachers
and students don&amp;#39;t feel safe, student learning will suffer. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I get that there are downsides to staying remote but don&amp;#39;t fool
yourself into believing that just because you&amp;#39;re sending your kid to
school they&amp;#39;ll be socializing and doing all that good in person
stuff. They&amp;#39;ll be sitting in rows watching a projector and then
shuffled home.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sure, remote is not as good as normal in person classes but don&amp;#39;t
blame teachers, blame the pandemic. These are exceptional times and
bad and unsafe  in person &amp;#34;solutions&amp;#34; are much worse than safety of
remote. At the end of the day, this pandemic will pass and we will get
back to in person. So what if a for a year students don&amp;#39;t reach some
arbitrary standard bar because remote is sub-optimal. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if safe, scared teachers can&amp;#39;t teach and scared students won&amp;#39;t
learn.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PSA on CSTA (NYC)</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/psa-for-csta/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Just a quick public service announcemnt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Up until now CSTA-NYC has been using Meetup to organize and advertise
events but now they&amp;#39;re moving over to using the CSTA site as their
platform. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re a CS teacher you should be a part of CSTA. There&amp;#39;s both a
free tier and a plus tier which costs $50 a year.  I&amp;#39;ve been a plus
member since that level became available. If you&amp;#39;re a NYC teacher, you
should join the CSTA NYC chapter. If you&amp;#39;re already coming to CSTA-NYC
events, you should still go to the CSTA web site and check to make
sure you&amp;#39;re part of the NYC chapter so that you don&amp;#39;t miss any
exciting announcements or events. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Supporting Our Students</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/supporting-our-students/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2020 12:22:26 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/supporting-our-students/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Austin Cory Bart put together a great &lt;a href=&#34;https://acbart.github.io//2020/06/10/race-in-cs1/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about supporting Black
students in CS1. Cory asked about this on the SIGCSE mailing list and
in his post he both breaks things down and shares all the resources
that he compiled from the ensuing discussion. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s a lot of good stuff both in the post and in the links but
there&amp;#39;s a lot to get lost in. As teachers we can sometimes affect
change at a department or school level but we can always make a
difference in our classes and with our students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I titled this post &amp;#34;Supporting Our Students&amp;#34; and not &amp;#34;Supporting Black
Students.&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;m certainly &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; pulling any all lives matter BS but
rather reflecting back on something that shaped my approach with my
students and started to open my eyes and that specific experience for
me was an all students experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I cut my teach at Seward Park High School down on the Lower East
Side. It was a high poverty school and a very diverse one. I had
top flight honors students, criminal thugs, druggies, sweet kids whom
the system failed and everything else you can imagine. The main groups
were classified back then as Chinese and Hispanic and then Black then
White but within those groups there were subdivisions. Shortly before
I got the gig the school had brokered an in school truce between the
factions of Chinese gangs and while the term of the day was
Hispanic the students were from a variety of places.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One day I was talking to a guidance counselor in the hall. We didn&amp;#39;t
know each other - I shanghaied her in another conversation - I had
something to ask. She said &amp;#34;wait - you&amp;#39;re Zamansky right?&amp;#34; Yep. &amp;#34;I was
wondering who you were, all the students want to be in your class.&amp;#34; I
was confused. I wasn&amp;#39;t super popular - I was just in about a year and
a half. I also wasn&amp;#39;t so good. I&amp;#39;d rate myself as an above average
very raw young teacher but that&amp;#39;s about it. She explained that I was
one of the only teachers where students from all the population groups
wanted to be in my class. The Hispanic students, for instance all
wanted to be in Pablo Chang&amp;#39;s math class, the Chinese in another
teachers but apparently I appealed to everyone equally. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started to think about why that might be the case and it got me
thinking about what I had learned in my short time teaching. Prior to
teaching I led a pretty sheltered life. I went to public school up
until college and had a pretty diverse group of friends but as a kid
you can be pretty oblivious to economic and race related
differences. As an adult I went to a private college, NYU, and started off
at Goldman Sachs. Not exactly a recipe for awareness. I quickly
realized that not all kids learned the same, thought the same and
going further, lived the same.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It taught me that it&amp;#39;s not merely about talking to your students, it&amp;#39;s
about listening to them. Given time and the chance, they&amp;#39;ll open up
and you&amp;#39;ll learn about their challenges. When it seems there giving
you a song and dance, don&amp;#39;t assume they&amp;#39;re trying to pull a fast
one. Give them the benefit of the doubt. You&amp;#39;ll get burned now and
again by a kid taking advantage but things have a way of coming clean
and if you don&amp;#39;t give the kid the benefit of the doubt you can
irreparably harm your relationship. Trust is key in
education.  Besides I&amp;#39;ve been burned way more by giving the benefit of
the doubt to people professionally than as a teacher and at the end of
the day I&amp;#39;d rather lose sleep angry over being taken advantage of than
lose sleep feeling guilty for damaging my relationship with a student
for the wrong reasons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you treat your students like people - young people but  people
nonetheless and earnestly listen and try to learn from them and learn
about them that&amp;#39;s your guide. I&amp;#39;m not saying I&amp;#39;m particularly good at
helping my kids - I&amp;#39;m your stereotypical socially awkward computer
geek but the more I listened the more I understood the individual
issues my students had to deal with. My Black students, my immigrant
students, my poor students and all the rest. Sure there were common
themes but every one has a unique story.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While we teach our assorted subjects to our students really at the end
of the day more so than teaching any specific computer science I hope
to be a force for good in their lives and their development as
people. The best way I can do that is to listen, try to learn, try to
understand and then try to help and support.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teachers and Police</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-police/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2020 10:56:52 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-police/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Teachers and Police 
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s been an ugly few days but perhaps in some ways a hopeful few as
people have been making their voices heard like never before in my
lifetime. We&amp;#39;ve seen and endless stream of videos of peaceful protest
and far too many instances of police officers overstepping their
bounds. I keep hearing about violent protesters but those videos seem
to be avoiding my feeds as are the videos of law enforcement going
after the looters who are a separate group from the protestors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not comfortable getting on a soapbox about race relations in this
country. I want and strive to be an ally but I think my place is to
listen and support not dictate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even so, we keep hearing about police accountability on one side that
they need their protections on the other. I thought I&amp;#39;d look at that
and compare the job of a police officer to that of a teacher. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
My experience
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the one side, I&amp;#39;ve been a teacher for close to 30 years. On the
police side? I&amp;#39;ve never been a cop but I was an auxiliary cop for a
while. I stopped soon after I went in to teaching. I was able to do it
while on Wall Street but teaching is just so much harder and more
draining that I didn&amp;#39;t have the energy. As an auxiliary cop I got a
bit of an inside view. I didn&amp;#39;t patrol the bad parts of the precinct
much - Manhattan Valley,  but I did a bit. I also got to interact with
the police and was listening to police radio during my tours so knew
what was or wasn&amp;#39;t going on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
Key Requirements
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
Police
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sixty college credits or military experience, pass a written and
physical test, psychological test and then the Police Academy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-5&#34;&gt;
Teachers
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Masters degree, standardized tests, student teaching although the
quality ranges from rigorous preparation to fly by night TFA nonsense.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-6&#34;&gt;
Perceptions
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-7&#34;&gt;
Police
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the one side you have police as heroes. This is probably to an
extend residual from 9/11 grouping them in with firefighters and
EMT. You&amp;#39;ll also hear that they face death every day and if there
weren&amp;#39;t protections like qualified immunity you&amp;#39;d never have anyone
sign up for the job. We also keep hearing that the &amp;#34;majority are good
cops&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;only a few bad apples.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other side, ACAB.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-8&#34;&gt;
Teachers
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the one hand you&amp;#39;ll hear we&amp;#39;re the backbone of society and should
be paid more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other, we&amp;#39;re glorified babysitters who do nothing for pay and
pension. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-9&#34;&gt;
Reality 
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This post isn&amp;#39;t really about teaching so I&amp;#39;m not going to dwell on
that side other than as a comparison but education going remote has,
if nothing else, proven that teachers are anything but lazy
goodfornothings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the police side, video evidence shows that a few bad apples do
indeed spoil the bunch and when both police commissioners and police
union chiefs and even mayors repeatedly lie, distort and omit you know
we need some real changes. I keep hearing about the police needing to
maintain order and acting reasonably but with all those body cameras
plus police officers specifically at protests to film and document I
haven&amp;#39;t seen anything backing the police line. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As to the police facing death every day? Yes, there&amp;#39;s always the
possibility of a bad encounter but in my time with the auxiliary I
can&amp;#39;t ever remember hearing a call for &amp;#34;officer needs assistance&amp;#34; nor
vary many intense situations. Most of the job was being in the
community. In fact, it turns out that most police officers go through
their entire careers &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/08/a-closer-look-at-police-officers-who-have-fired-their-weapon-on-duty/&#34;&gt;never firing their weapon&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the same time, teachers in many schools face violence or the threat
of violence and are under no circumstances allowed to even touch a
student. We are supposed to deescalate. Is there a reason why police
can&amp;#39;t do the same? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-10&#34;&gt;
On reform
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some people are calling for more training but I&amp;#39;m not one of
them. I&amp;#39;ve had corprorate, teacher, and city training. It&amp;#39;s all CYA
garbage. It doesn&amp;#39;t change behavior. Eric Garner was choked
in 2014. Chokeholds were banned by the NYPD in, I think around 1993
and you can bet that was in the &amp;#34;training&amp;#34; officers received. Training
reminds good people how to act. Training helps give you a tool if
you&amp;#39;re inclined to use it. Hire a thug and no training is going
to make them an angel. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m more on the defund side but that doesn&amp;#39;t just mean cut the
budget. Here are a few things I&amp;#39;d like to see:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Beat cops - this is something that David Dinkins did with
Commissioner Brown and they never get credit. They took the cop out
of the car and put them on the beat. On foot. Make them part of the
community they&amp;#39;re policing. Once they went back into the cars they
were out of the communities. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Better accountability - when the next contract comes around we need
our politicians to take a &lt;strong&gt;hard&lt;/strong&gt; line on accountability. Things like
community review boards, penalties for turned off cameras,
transparent records on police misconduct. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Make police accountable for bad behavior - while police need due
process, in the rare times there&amp;#39;s any accountability it&amp;#39;s usually
in terms of a payout to the public. This doesn&amp;#39;t affect the police
because it&amp;#39;s paid by the taxpayer. Let&amp;#39;s change that. The city
contributes to police pensions. Let&amp;#39;s reduce that as needed to pay
for settlements. If not, how about start with the police salary
scale and adjust it annually to pay for settlements. Make those
responsible feel it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The sad thing is that unless the protests continue there might not be
change. I fear that we&amp;#39;ll get a few speeches and some surface changes
when we need fundamental change. The solutions aren&amp;#39;t hard but we
need people in power who will actually implement them. de Blasio came
to office claiming to be a progressive but he caved to the police
force at the first signs of resistance. We need to put up candidate
who will actually represent the people and make changes and then we
actually have to get out and vote them in.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Before condemning try walking in their shoes</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/privilege/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Jun 2020 19:20:55 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/privilege/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve got some CS Ed stuff I want to write but can&amp;#39;t bring myself to
writing about it today. I rarely post outside of my wheelhouse - CS,
Education and the intersection of the two.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t really think I&amp;#39;m qualified to say much about the current
crisis. The out of control police, racism, class warfare, a failed
government not only at the federal level but also in New York city and
state but maybe I can share something worthwhile from my narrow
experiences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been seeing too many posts and tweets about the protests
condemning any rioting. I&amp;#39;ve never promoted violence but still I
thought I might have something to say.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The important background piece is that for those of us who are white
and who grew up with some level if privilege, it&amp;#39;s hard for us to
really understand the what oppressed people suffer.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started life in a somewhat well to do family, I attended private
school through first grade, then my parents pulled me and my
siblings out for public school - somethingn for which I&amp;#39;m now
grateful. Shortly after, my dad got sick, lost his job and later passed
away. That left my mom raising 3 kids on a teachers salary. On the one
hand we had the apartment, on the other I wore hand-me-downs. I worked
my way through school and payed &amp;#34;rent&amp;#34; living at home not because I
wanted to but because we needed me to. So, we weren&amp;#39;t well to do but
although I didn&amp;#39;t realize it at the time, I possessed great privilege
both in terms of my skin color and also in terms of what my mom was
willing and more importantly able to sacrifice of herself for her
children. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I got older my schools, though public were less reflective of
society. Populations were pretty diverse but I was brought up in
something of an intellectual bubble and under the belief it was a
meritocracy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After school and a stint on Wall street, I went to teach at Seward
Park. What an awakening. It was my first exposure to kids and families
living under far harsher circumstances than I. When I was a kid I
volunteered at a soup kitchen. I couldn&amp;#39;t reconcile the family that on
the one hand had to come to the kitchen for food while the family all
wore really expensive sneakers (I was wearing the $10 Alexander&amp;#39;s
special). As I got more exposed to &amp;#34;how the other half lived&amp;#34; I
learned that it was more complex. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I went into teaching on a whim, as my career progressed I
realized more and more how important public education was and the job
became more of a mission. At the same time, as I learned more and more
about the populations that I tried to serve so that I could support them
and try to really know their circumstances. I realized that it&amp;#39;s really
hard to &amp;#34;get it.&amp;#34; I also realized that the more removed you are, the
higher up you are on the ladder, the harder it is. That&amp;#39;s not to say
that there aren&amp;#39;t many well to do people with huge hearts trying to
and doing good it&amp;#39;s just that I feel that the further you are from the
ground floor the harder it is to really understand the issues that the
ground floor people have to live with.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, this brings us back to the protests and the rioting. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Separating out the protesters and rioters we really have 4 types of
rioters:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Criminals - people who are going to riot and loot whenever the
opportunity presents itself. Remember Philly after the Eagles won
the Superbowl?  These people are just criminals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Riots resulting from police instigators - well, we should condemn
the police and not their victims and we&amp;#39;ve seen a bunch of video
evidence of this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Riots resulting from white agitatos - same as the previous point. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Riots from within the protest group.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That last group - group 4 are the only ones who are part of the
protest groups but let&amp;#39;s not be so fast to condemn them. It&amp;#39;s easy for
those of us of privilege to point fingers and say &amp;#34;shame on you,
protest peacefully&amp;#34; but where has that gotten them? We were talking
about this earlier and I was trying to remember an earlier victim of
police brutality. I was thinking of Rodney King 20 years ago but was
blanking on the name. Devorah rattled off names walking back the
years. Two decades, countless abuses and nothing changed with
peaceful protest. There comes a time when you feel you&amp;#39;re out of
options. It&amp;#39;s easy for us to point and condemn but very hard to
understand. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Am I promoting violence? No. I feel bad about innocents hurt and small
business owners who&amp;#39;s property has been damaged but what about the
lives that have been lost or destroyed due to police abuse and
government inaction and in fact government support?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are solutions. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joincampaignzero.org/#vision&#34;&gt;Campaign Zero&lt;/a&gt; has a lot of info on how to reform
policing. We also have to fully fund schools and actually deal with
poverty rather than make it a crime.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t have any inspirational message here or any real answers. The
work goes on. I&amp;#39;ll continue my work in public education try to support
my students and understand them and their challenges more and more and
try to be a better ally to those less privileged than I. 
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Covid-19 Journey (so far)</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/covid/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2020 07:59:23 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/covid/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I haven&amp;#39;t been posting much over the past couple of weeks and that&amp;#39;s
partly because we&amp;#39;ve been under the weather.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yep - Covid-19. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First things first - we&amp;#39;re all either recovered or well on the way. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I thought I&amp;#39;d write up our experience as it might be useful for
others who are going through similar. This disease is weird and seems
to affect people differently but three of us followed a similar path.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In terms of our current status, I&amp;#39;ve been symptom free for a few
days. My sense of smell hasn&amp;#39;t fully returned but it&amp;#39;s starting to and
I&amp;#39;ve been fever free for around two weeks. I&amp;#39;ve been using a pulse
oximeter  and that&amp;#39;s been reading normal. I still feel a bit off in
the evenings, haven&amp;#39;t been sleeping well and get a bit of a headache
but I think that&amp;#39;s mostly my inner hypochondriac and the headaches
from the poor sleep. Besides, the headaches feel different than when I
was having symptoms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Batya and Devorah have been clear for a week longer than I&amp;#39;ve been and
Natan hasn&amp;#39;t yet shown any symptoms so hopefully he got it, built some
antibodies and is done.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Batya got it first then Devorah then me. The symptoms were largely the
same. As they say - flu like. Fever, chills, low energy, head or chest
congestion and loss of smell and taste. I never fully lost my taste
(but then nobody would accuse me of having good taste anyway) but it
did dull. Batya and I also got headaches. They were a little weird -
kindof between a regular headache and a migraine. We never had bad
coughs, just occasional ones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The actual fever/chills part lasted for about 3 or 4 days each. Never
got as bad as a bad case of the flu and we never felt we had to rush
to the emergency room but we all essentially took some days off for
work. For me, it was mostly being lucky - my class days and important
meetings fell outside my sick zone and I was able to focus enough to
do the planning I had to albeit not optimally.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We never relapsed but recovery was slow. After the fever passed, we
all went through the &amp;#34;I think I&amp;#39;m feeling better&amp;#34; stage where we still
had some congestion and were feeling &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; but we seemed to go in the
right direction. This seemed to last forever but at least for me, one
day a few days ago, I finally woke up feeling pretty good. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By all counts we&amp;#39;ve been lucky. Hopefully we&amp;#39;ll have some level of
immunity - we&amp;#39;re going to try to get antibody testing to see if we can
give plasma. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the things to watch out for if you do got through this is the
lethargy. I&amp;#39;ve been in a funk for most of the past month. I guess that&amp;#39;s
because of the difficulty in sustaining focus when actually sick and
the stress even when you&amp;#39;re feeling okay. Over this past weekend
when I was finally able to restart a number of projects is what&amp;#39;s
making me feel I&amp;#39;m really out of the woods. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, that&amp;#39;s been our Covid-19 journey. I hope posting this provides
another data point for people - what it&amp;#39;s like for those of us who are
getting it but have been lucky so as not to get it so bad. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hoping you&amp;#39;re all staying safe and healthy.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Email or USPS</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/email-or-usps/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2020 14:00:41 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/email-or-usps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
USPS is in financial trouble. That&amp;#39;s been pretty well documented
recently. Most reasonable people will recognize that the USPS is both
an important service and while it receives no taxpayer support would
be profitable were it not for the GOP imposing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.truthorfiction.com/is-usps-losing-money-because-of-a-2006-pension-law/&#34;&gt;unfair and unrealistic
pension funding requirements&lt;/a&gt; in 2006.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although I&amp;#39;m an ardent supporter of the post office and feel that
privatization of such an important intuition would be criminal today I
want to talk about some small repercussions of so many things going to
email rather than snail mail. Small in the greater sense but maybe
pretty big to the people affected.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back in the old days college acceptances went out via old fashioned
paper mail. It took a bit of time but it was super reliable no matter
where you lived. Nowadays I&amp;#39;m pretty sure college acceptances are
still sent out via USPS but you can also find out online. That&amp;#39;s
terrific. The potential issue comes up for opportunities that are only
announced via email. This is the case for my program and also for a
number of other college and university honors program that I&amp;#39;m aware
of. Part of this is certainly due to timing as the window from getting
applications to confirming participation is very small but it&amp;#39;s still
unfortunate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This past year, I&amp;#39;ve had a few cases of bad email addresses. For one
reason or another I had to reach out to a candidate only to get the
email bounced back. This isn&amp;#39;t really horrible as I&amp;#39;ve always been
able to hunt down a correct address either through Hunter or through
my friends teaching at the high schools. The real problem is that
students don&amp;#39;t always read or see all their emails. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I had a student who applied for my program with an active email but
their high school school somehow sent over to Hunter one that the student didn&amp;#39;t
use. Had I not caught it by chance that student who&amp;#39;s now with us and
doing great wouldn&amp;#39;t be. In another case I was talking to a student
who by chance new another student who we offered a seat but never took
it. It came up in conversation that this kid was very unhappy at the
college they ended up going to. I asked why they didn&amp;#39;t take our offer
to be in the Daedalus program. We later found out that the student
never saw the offer. It either went to a non-used address or a SPAM
filter or was just buried in the inbox. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a problem. Not so much for those of us running these
programs - we&amp;#39;re going to fill with qualified, deserving
students. Rather for qualified and deserving students who miss out on
the chance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When something goes out via USPS we can be fairly certain it will at
some point in the near future be in the hands of the intended
recipient. USPS is really good at that. With email, we can&amp;#39;t always be
sure.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/passover-2020/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday was the start of Passover and like many others we weren&amp;#39;t
able to physically gather with friends and family to
celebrate. Since the Talmud, unlike the NYC Dept of Education, doesn&amp;#39;t
seem to ban Zoom, like many others, we used Zoom to connect with
family.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tonight we&amp;#39;ll do it again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the meantime, I thought I&amp;#39;d share this small bit of research Natan
did a couple of years ago on a traditional part of the seder: &lt;a href=&#34;http://seccorecit.blogspot.com/2018/04/a-historically-informed-echad-mi-yodea.html&#34;&gt;A
Historically Informed Echad Mi Yodea&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy

      <title>Guest Post - Missing out on a great opportunity in education</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/guest-jonalf-dw/</link>

      <description>
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Preamble
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve never accepted a guest post before but when my friend and long
time colleague JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver said he had something to say I
was all for it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
JonAlf&amp;#39;s one of the best teachers I know - he started at Brandeis HS and
has been at Stuy forever. Really sharp guy, great teacher, and really
perceptive. When he has something to say it&amp;#39;s 100% worth listening
to. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To JonAlf - since I know this is one of my blog posts you&amp;#39;ll actually
read - you should set up a blog of your own. The community would be
all the better for it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Missing out on a great opportunity in education
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
By JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, educators across the nation are
adapting to remote learning. I‚Äôve watched my colleagues work hard
putting together plans on how to deliver content, engage students and
assess their learning. Some, like myself, are combining multiple tools
in order to achieve these goals while others are using a single
platform for it all. I count myself lucky that the administration in
my school has given its teachers the leeway to select their own tools
instead of forcing a single platform on us. Last week, as I was
thinking through what my plan was going to be, a particular thought
kept nagging at me:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We are facing an amazing opportunity in the world of education. Think
of how many lessons, worksheets, notes, examples, etc. are being put
out in some electronic form.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-5&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Students will (hopefully) have access to the materials for their
classes, and teachers in the same school may also be able to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-6&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will never be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about the teacher three states away that‚Äôs struggling to find good resources or new problems?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-7&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will never be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about the student in a different district, perhaps one that has
shut down entirely, who just wants to learn and do some work in order
to help fill the days?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-8&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will never be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The internet gives us the ability to put all of these resources out
there to the public, and it pains me to think about how much of this
work is going to be hidden behind one platform or another. So many of
the educational technologies make it very easy to post work for your
class and very hard, if not impossible, to share it with other people
(you‚Äôre school doesn‚Äôt also have a license for XYZ?, sorry).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, there are many teachers out there that have no choice, they
are being mandated to use whatever the school decrees. There are
others, perhaps the less technically savvy, that are going to use
whatever they can get trained on quickly. We‚Äôre all running a 2 minute
drill and working with what we have. I get that, and it is not a
teacher‚Äôs job to provide materials for everyone. That being said, If
you have the knowhow, or would like to learn, there are ways to make
your work publicly available. Last summer Mike and I ran a session at
the CSTA conference on using GitHub for just this purpose, and hope to
run a workshop on it this summer (For those interested, I made a brief
tutorial about how to do this.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brazilian Carrot Cake</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/carrot-cake/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Mar 2020 15:55:03 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/carrot-cake/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;figure class=&amp;#34;z_image_center&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;img src=&amp;#34;/img/carrot-cake.jpg&amp;#34;/&amp;gt; 
&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not my normal post but these are not normal times. Besides, this isn&amp;#39;t
the first &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2010-05-02-flatbreads.html/&#34;&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#39;ve posted. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m one of those that will, as long as supplies allow, bake and cook
my way through our shelter in. Today I made Brazilian carrot
cake. It&amp;#39;s not quite the same as an American carrot cake as you&amp;#39;ll see
from the recipe below. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, carrot cake rules:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Obviously since it contains carrot which is a vegetable, it&amp;#39;s healthy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you don&amp;#39;t ice it and serve it before evening, it&amp;#39;s carrot bread and
therefore a healthy option for breakfast, brunch, or snack.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Only when you add the frosting or icing does it become carrot cake and
hence dessert. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This recipe is the family recipe of one of my daughter&amp;#39;s coworkers. I
can only imagine it&amp;#39;s from some Brazilian grandmother and hence the
measurement of &amp;#34;3 large carrots.&amp;#34; It makes me think of recipes that
I&amp;#39;d get from bubbe or my mothers bubbe - &amp;#34;add 2 cups of sugar.&amp;#34; Of
course she was talking about 2 empty yartzeit glasses of sugar. I have
a relative who followed around here grandmother an before she added
any ingredient for a recipe put it in a standard measure to 
convert the recipe to something that we could make sense of today.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Okay, now on to the recipe:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Ingredients
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Cake
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
3 carrots, peeled and sliced)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
3 eggs (large)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1 cup oil
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
2 cups sugar
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
2 cups flour
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1 tablespoon baking powder
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
Brigadeiro sauce
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1 can sweetened condensed milk
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1 tablespoon butter
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
4 tablespoons of cocoa (or use some other chocolate and melt it in)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
Buttermilk Glaze
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I sometimes use this instead of the brigadeiro sauce
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
2/3 cups buttermilk
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1 to 2 cups powdered sugar
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-5&#34;&gt;
Directions
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-6&#34;&gt;
Cake
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Preheat oven to 350
Prepare pan (I line the bottom with parchment and grease)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mix sugar, flour, baking powder in a bowl
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Blend carrots in a blender
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Add oil and eggs to blender and blend all together
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fold carrot mixture into dry ingredients
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
pour into prepared pan
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
bake for ~40 mintues
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-7&#34;&gt;
Bigadeiro sauce (if using) 
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
combine all ingredients in saucepan
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
cook, stirring until thickened (about 10 minutes) 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You&amp;#39;ll know it&amp;#39;s thick enough when you drag your spoon across the
pan and you can see the bottom. It will thicken up considerably when
it cools so better if it&amp;#39;s looser rather than thicker.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
spread on cake while warm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-8&#34;&gt;
Buttermilk glaze (if using)
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
whisk together glaze ingredients until smooth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
poke holes all over cake with a fork or knife

      <title>Career Directions - how a sad day changed mine</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/career-directions/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I was talking to a friend yesterday who had just started doing grad
work in school leadership. It got me thinking about my original career
plans and how you never know where you&amp;#39;re going to end up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Well, not my original original career plans. When I started on Wall
Street I had no idea what the future would bring. For all I knew, I
could have been a career professional programmer or even gone over to
the business side.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I started teaching, it was as a math teacher and back then, I
thought that if I were to do it for my career, it would probably be in
math with maybe a smattering of CS. I had reached out to DOE once
about a greater role for CS but this was in the very early 90s and was
summarily dismissed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What changed?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was September 1996. I had graduated my first class of CS students
having taught 4 sections of APCS-AB and one of Comptuer Graphics - a course I
created to get out of teaching Geometry. I had just started the
Systems course and given the culture of the school and the trends of
the times it looked like I&amp;#39;d be able to teach all CS for the
foreseeable future if I so desired.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My friend and mentor Richie Rothenberg was the math chair. Richie, or
Doc as we sometimes called him started to talk to me about succession
plans. Richie was going to turn 50 that spring. In five years he&amp;#39;d
both hit retirement and his kids would be done with college. The plan
was to groom me as his replacement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sounded like a good idea. I enrolled in Hunter&amp;#39;s school leadership
certificate program and we were on our way. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Early that spring, Richie called me in to his office and told me that
CS enrollment had skyrocketed. He was my boss but wanted to know if he
could be the other CS teacher, shadow me and follow my lead as the CS
guy. I was super psyched for this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If things went to plan, Richie and I would have split CS for the next
few years while I took on a larger administrative roll and then when
Richie retired, I&amp;#39;d take the reigns. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If that happened I probably wouldn&amp;#39;t have pushed for more CS and
history or at least my history would have been very different. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What happened?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
May 15 1997. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Richie, on his 50th birthday, driving home, suffered a heart attack,
crashed his car and passed away.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was devastating. For me and for the school. I wrote a bit about
more about Richie &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2012-05-09-my-favorite-year-teacher.html/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-11-07-rich-rich.html/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t yet have my license and in any event wasn&amp;#39;t ready. The
principal chose Danny Jaye, another great friend and mentor for the
position. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that up until then Danny had no real desire
to be department chair. He seemed happy ruling over his math reserach
domain and working int he dean&amp;#39;s office.  Danny would adopt the
moniker &amp;#34;doc&amp;#34; but we&amp;#39;d also refer to him as &amp;#34;The Maestro.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would finish getting my supervisors certificate but would never use
it and ended up forging what has been my path in the CS Ed
space. Danny would not only take Stuy&amp;#39;s math department to new places
but also led revolutionary work in NY City and State in terms of math
education and their math teams.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Had that tragedy not occurred on May 1997, for better or worse I
probably never get involved in the greater CS Ed movement and only a
select few at Stuy end up benefiting from Danny&amp;#39;s work (and Danny, as
a side note is an amazing teacher - back in the day, he got my brother
Steve to both understand calculus and enjoy calc class).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Talking to JoAnn had me reminiscing about all of this. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I still miss Richie and  tear up when I think about him but that is
the past. That event was horrific for Richie, his family and friends
but also changed a number of life trajectories. Funny how that works.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I&#39;m looking forward to in 2020</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/looking-forward-2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 12:45:44 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/looking-forward-2020/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Happy new year to everyone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been reading some prediction posts this morning on blogs and
social media. Big national and world level stuff. I&amp;#39;ve never been much
for predictions so I thought I&amp;#39;d share some more local and personal
things I&amp;#39;m looking forward to in the coming year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First a couple of big ones. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m just about to complete my fourth year at Hunter. Time really does
fly. It&amp;#39;s been a long road but late in 2019 NY State finally approved
our CS Teacher Certification programs!!!!  That&amp;#39;s big news. Some day
I&amp;#39;ll go into the frustrations and ridiculousness that caused a year
plus delay but now that&amp;#39;s all in the past and we&amp;#39;re good to go. We&amp;#39;ve
got a Masters program for aspiring teachers and a certificate program
for teachers who are already licensed in another subject area.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The plan is to run a summer intensive in July and have our first
cohort through the program by the end of 2020. We have a real
opportunity here to get ahead of things and build a group of certified
master CS teachers in and for NYC. This can be relly big and is very
exciting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other big thing for me has to do with the other big initiative I
started at Hunter - the Daedalus CS Scholars program. The program has
been growing each year both in terms of students and in terms of
programs and student opportunities. The exciting thing for me is that
we&amp;#39;re about to have our first graduates. The Daedalus program didn&amp;#39;t
exist four years ago and now it&amp;#39;s a big part of Hunter CS and soon it
will be sending graduates out into the world. I&amp;#39;m super happy and
proud of what the students have done and continue to do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Both of these really excite me. When I started, I figured it would be
about five years to get things running smoothly so to have both in
existence in 4 is super cool. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Other things I&amp;#39;m looking forward to? I&amp;#39;ll be giving a talk at SIGCSE2020
in a couple of months on how to take your students from GitHub
neophytes to pull request masters and then a full workshop version at
CSTA2020. I&amp;#39;m stoked about going to both conferences and also to help
Devorah once again run her  &lt;a href=&#34;http://blanketstatementproject.com/&#34;&gt;Blanket Statement&lt;/a&gt; project at CSTA.  If I can get the
funding there are also a couple of other conferences I&amp;#39;d love to
attend. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also looked over the list of speakers for CSTA2020 (harder to
navigate for SIGCSE) and am really  excited to see many friends
present. Also noticed Mark Emry will be presenting and really hope to
see Mark in person after something like over a dozen years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the personal side of things, Batya moved into her own apartment
just before the new year and Devorah&amp;#39;s setting up Batya&amp;#39;s room as a
fiber studio so we&amp;#39;ll have some adjustments on the home front but all
good and all exciting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m sure there are other exciting things to come in 2020 but that&amp;#39;s
enough for now.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Waterfalls - a trip report</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/waterfalls/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2019 19:18:13 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
No, this post is not about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model&#34;&gt;Waterfall development model&lt;/a&gt;. Devorah
and I had a chance to take a little vacation up north.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First stop, Niagara Falls.

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;br clear=&amp;#34;all&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We did the Canada side 9 years ago when we did our Erie Canal bike
trip (you can read about that by checking out some of my early &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2010-08-05-erie-canal-day-1.html/&#34;&gt;blog
posts&lt;/a&gt;). This time, the American side. My take is that the Canadian
side is more polished and all private attractions - think Times Square
or Disney. On the American side, the town itself is somewhat run down
but the attractions are all state park making them well maintained and
affordable. We did the &amp;#34;touristy stuff&amp;#34; - Maid of the Mist and Cave of
the winds, both of which were well worth it and also things like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://parks.ny.gov/parks/105/details.aspx&#34;&gt;Whirlpool State Park&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nypa.gov/&#34;&gt;Niagara Power Project&lt;/a&gt; along with a few
other attractions. We got a nice dinner at the Niagara Culinary
Institute and an okay one in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g48050-Lewiston_New_York.html&#34;&gt;Lewiston&lt;/a&gt;. There were a few things we
didn&amp;#39;t get to do and I&amp;#39;m not sure there&amp;#39;s enough to merit a return
trip but we really enjoyed the day and a half we spent at the falls.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next up was half a day at Old Fort Niagara about 25 minutes north of
the falls;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Lots of cool history from both the war of 1812, revolution  and the French and
Indian war. We&amp;#39;re such a young nation so it was cool to see standing
structures from pre-colonial times.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From there we drove in to Canada. On &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dougpete&#34;&gt;Doug Peterson&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s suggestion we
stopped at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welland_Canal&#34;&gt;Welland Canal&lt;/a&gt; which connects Lake Ontario to Lake
Erie. It&amp;#39;s much wider than our own &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie_Canal&#34;&gt;Erie Canal&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately connects
the midwest to the port of Montreal and beyond.

pushed by the pusher tug The Sea Eagle II. Using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.marinetraffic.com/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; site I was able
to track it going over to Cleveland. That website is really cool - on
it you can track &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the boats. It also has an API so you can have
your students use it in class projects. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The image on the right is the same boat a couple of minutes later
after the lock emptied and lowered. Really cool. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We settled in that evening in Hamilton Onntario.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hamilton is known as the Waterfall Capital of the world.

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;br clear=&amp;#34;all&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It didn&amp;#39;t disappoint. We didn&amp;#39;t get to the two biggest falls - Webster
and Tews but we spent a long day of walking the trails and did get to
see six or seven of them including &lt;a href=&#34;https://tourismhamilton.com/devils-punchbowl&#34;&gt;the Devil&amp;#39;s Punchbowl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://tourismhamilton.com/albion-falls&#34;&gt;Albion
Falls&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://tourismhamilton.com/felkers-falls&#34;&gt;Felker&amp;#39;s Falls&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s pretty cool that we&amp;#39;re still in the
city but are on these hiking trails. We could probably have done
another day or two just hiking the rest of the falls and another day
to see other local attractions like the botanical gardens.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our last stop was &lt;a href=&#34;https://parks.ny.gov/parks/79/details.aspx&#34;&gt;Letchworth State Park.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Letchworth is truly a hidden gem just as the Ithaca area state parks -
Treman, Buttermilk Falls, and Taughannock but more so.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Beautiful waterfall and gorge views. You can go on a hardcore hike or
just drive from view to view. At the south end you&amp;#39;ve got the three
major waterfalls and at the north end the Mount Morris Dam. There&amp;#39;s
also some pretty good food at the Iris Inn which is at the south end
of the park. We didn&amp;#39;t stay there but if we go back, I think we will.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you haven&amp;#39;t been and get a chance, you won&amp;#39;t be
disappointed. There&amp;#39;s a reason Letchworth is called the Grand Canyon
of the East. Not nearly as big or majestic but just as beautiful in
it&amp;#39;s own right.
&lt;/p&gt;

We&amp;#39;ll probably head through this way again we still haven&amp;#39;t but want
to get to Toronto. When we do we&amp;#39;ll probably spend additional time in
Hamilton and Letchworth. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now it&amp;#39;s back home and try to get in a few more restful days before
the semester begins.

      <title>Codeland 2019</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/codeland-2019/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2019 19:46:38 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/codeland-2019/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I spent today at &lt;a href=&#34;https://codelandconf.com/&#34;&gt;Codeland&lt;/a&gt;, a one day conference in NYC designed for
developers in the early stages of their careers. Just as at CSTA, I
was there with the GitHub contingent.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Codeland had talks and a keynote in a common auditorium, smaller
breakout workshops and a couple of small vendor areas.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I spent most of the morning upstairs in the GitHub lounge so I onl
caught part of one morning talk. Up in the lounge we, along with the
other vendors - IBM, Flatiron health, and Command Line Hero were
available to talk shop and hang out with conference goers. To be
honest, not too many people came by. I attribute that to the fact that
we were up on the ninth floor and the elevators didn&amp;#39;t work very
well. We were in a nice space with plenty of areas for conference
goers to relax, schmooze, get a snack and even play games but it was
too much of an effort to get to us.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also decided not to attend any of the workshops and stayed up in the
lounge. The workshops were targeted at new devs early in their career
so while some looked interesting to me, I didn&amp;#39;t want to take up a
seat from anyone who really could benefit from them,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After lunch, I relocated to the downstairs vendor area. That was much
better. Since it was right near both the snacks and the main
auditorium there was much more foot traffic. I also got to hear and
see all the afternoon talks since audio and video were available right
near where I was set up. They were pretty cool. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For me, the best part of the conference was the ability to talk with
the conference attendees. On the one hand, I was there to talk GitHub
but I also had the chance to talk general tech with them. I got to
talk to people at all stages on their coding journeys. There were
undergraduate students studying CS, second career people either in
code schools or self learning, Former CS students who&amp;#39;s lives had gone
in other directions but now they&amp;#39;re looking to get back into tech and
more. I got to hear about the excitement of their adventures and tried
to give advice and encouragement to those having a hard time breaking
in to tech. Having shepherded so many people from neophytes to
professionals I&amp;#39;d like to think I could provide some guidance to some
of the people chatted with.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know if there are any other conferences like Codeland but if
there aren&amp;#39;t there should be. It can be hard to break into tech and
Codeland created both a safe environment for tech newbies and also
provided really valuable content. I wasn&amp;#39;t familiar with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.codenewbie.org/&#34;&gt;CodeNewbie&lt;/a&gt;,
the organization behind Codeland before but now I&amp;#39;ll have to see if I
can have a sit down with them to talk shop and tech ed.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A 10X Student Story</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/ten-x-student-story/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2019 15:39:40 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/ten-x-student-story/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There were a bunch of threads on the 10X Developer recently. You
know - that mythical beast that&amp;#39;s 10 times more productive than the
regular software engineer. I didn&amp;#39;t see any of the original threads
but I&amp;#39;m guessing they started with &amp;#34;your startup needs them&amp;#34; and then
moved to the &amp;#34;they can&amp;#39;t work with anyone&amp;#34; along with tons of fun
tongue and cheek 1X engineer tweets.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It got me thinking about 10X students. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regardless of what you think about 10X developers, 10X people do
exist - at least to the way I&amp;#39;m thinking about them. There are people
who in any given dimension are &amp;#34;better,&amp;#34; however you define that, than
other people. In our society, if they&amp;#39;re 10X in popular sports we
treat them like demi-gods and frequently when achievements are group
efforts, we, as a society designate one individual as the 10X star and
laud them rather than the group.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regardless, there are 10X people. At Stuy, I&amp;#39;ve had a chance to work
with a number of them and I want to tell you a story about one and how
it affected the way I look at my students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s go back to the early to mid 1990s. I was teaching my first crop
of CS students. Many were math team aces. One in particular, Alex was
a superstar. Alex would end up representing the US in the
International Math Olympiad where he scored a perfect paper. He ended
up going right from Stuy to grad school even though his friends, the
math chair and I were trying to encourage him to start as an
undergrad. Why were we pushing Alex not to skip undergrad? Because
Alex was wired differently. While he was truly a genius with respect
to mathematics and he did pretty well in his other classes by turning
everything into a math problem he was not good with people. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
His friends spent years pulling him out of his shell and seemed to be
making progress but felt that if he ended up cloistered in grad school
all progress would be lost. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the end, he went to grad school but this story is about a
programming competition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At some point, one of my students, Eliot, told me about the USACO and
that he and a few others wanted to participate. It would be one day at
Stuy - a Saturday I seem to recall. While Stuy was on the internet
back then, the competition wasn&amp;#39;t. We were working on IBM PS/2 machines
running DOS. The students would write the programs and run them, print
out their solutions and I would compare the solutions with the correct
answers. When all was said and done I either had to mail a disk with
the solutions or printouts, I forget which to Rob and Don in
Wisconsin. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over the course of the day, participants would come up to me with
solutions and I&amp;#39;d check them off. At one point, Alex came up and said
he was done. I asked him to bring up his printout. I got a blank
stare. We went back and forth for a while with Alex seemingly being
recalcitrant about not bringing it up but he finally did.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Meanwhile, the other participants started to notice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started to look over Alex&amp;#39;s code. Lots of variables. Typically named
X, XX, XXX, XXXX etc. Maybe there is something to the 10X dev not
being able to write code well with others :-).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I told Alex that I needed to see the printout with the input and
output. He looked at me quizzically. Again we had a few minutes of
back and forth and Alex went back to print out his results. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One again, the other students took note.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, Alex gave me the printout with the results and I started
comparing the answers to the desired output - the answers were REALLLY
LONG integers so I had to check digit by digit. All the while Alex
looked at me as though I was nuts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The competition concluded, we packed up and I took the stragglers out
for dinner at the local diner. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next week, some students apologized for Alex&amp;#39;s behavior. They
thought it was rude. Not as bad as what another math ace would do to a
teacher a couple of years later which caused that years math team to
go west side story on him and almost beat their teammate up for
disrespecting a teacher but still they thought Alex was out of line in
the way he treated me during the competition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After thinking about Alex&amp;#39;s interactions with people, I had a
different take.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My take was that Alex very much respected me. To him, at the start
when he said he was done, he felt that I was a smart guy so I saw how
trivial the problems would be for him to solve. He then understood
that rules said that he had to give me the printout of the programs. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then, to Alex, again, I was a smart guy so clearly I could instantly
see that his printouts were correct so why was I insisting on the
output? Finally when I had to compare the digits, Alex was very
confused. &amp;#34;Z&amp;#39;s a smart guy, surely he can instantly see that my
answers are correct‚Ä¶&amp;#34; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Alex wasn&amp;#39;t being disrespectful. He was showing me more respect than I
deserved. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My interactions with Alex through the rest of the year as well as
observing him with others confirmed this. This wasn&amp;#39;t a super smart
kid being a jerk and looking down on us mere mortals. Here was a kid
who saw the world differently and thought that the rest of us had his
gifts if not more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve had the opportunity to interact with a number of 10X
individuals. Some as students, some as peers and colleagues, and some
as friends. More often than not, in my experience,  they&amp;#39;re wonderful unassuming
people. They assume I bring as much if not more to the table than they
do and they value what I have to say. It&amp;#39;s my insecurity that makes me
uncomfortable if I don&amp;#39;t have my A game. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sure, sometimes they&amp;#39;re jerks but most of the 10X people I&amp;#39;ve
encountered are anything but. The nice thing is that when I do meet a
10X who&amp;#39;s a jerk, I can remind myself that I know an 11X who isn&amp;#39;t so
I don&amp;#39;t have to waste my time on the 10X who is.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ebooks, Nypl and Process Starvation</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/ebooks-nypl-and-process-starvation/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2019 12:04:45 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/ebooks-nypl-and-process-starvation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m a big fan of E Ink e-readers. I had one a number of years ago. An &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mobiletechreview.com/gadgets/Astak-EZ-Reader.htm&#34;&gt;Aztak EZ
Reader&lt;/a&gt;. It was great. Small, cheap, and independent - that is, not
tied in to Amazon or Barnes and Nobles and I found myself doing a lot
more recreational reading with it. I still preferred paper for
technical books but for easy reading  there was nothing like having
tons of reading options always available.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Alas it sadly committed suicide by diving from my hand onto the hard
stone floor of the NY Post office as I waited on the passport line. I
tried other e-readers since then but found E ink so much easier on the
eyes. Not wanting to do my usual &amp;#34;schlepp all the books I might want
to read&amp;#34; on vacation a few years ago, I bit the bullet and bought a
kindle. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I originally had the EZ-Reader I loaded it with mostly public
domain books. With the Kindle, I have purchased a small number of
books from Amazon to go along with all sorts of goodies from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gutenberg.org/&#34;&gt;Project
Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt; but there&amp;#39;s also been one HUGE change in the landscape. The
&lt;a href=&#34;https://nypl.overdrive.com/&#34;&gt;New York Public Library&lt;/a&gt;.  Public libraries are some of our greatest
public goods and it&amp;#39;s unfortunate that they&amp;#39;re perpetually
underfunded. Where else can a kid or indeed anyone go on any given day
and spend time indoors with no expectation of spending money. What&amp;#39;s
more in addition to books and now movies and sometimes games they
provide all manner of community services and programs to and for the
public. In terms of e-books though, you can use the NYPL without
leaving the comfort of your home.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
NYPL has a web site where you can search for and take out ebooks and
have them sent right to your kindle for 28 days at a time. If they
don&amp;#39;t have enough copies - something of a ludicrous point for a
digital resource, you can place it on hold. If it&amp;#39;s close to being
due, you can renew it unless someone else is on the queue at which
point the renewal request becomes a hold request. It&amp;#39;s all rather
seamless.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My reading habits now regularly include taking out books from the
library and that&amp;#39;s led to an interesting resource issue - process
starvation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In case there are any on CS people reading this, everything running on
your computer at any point in time is a process. Each process gets a
small slice of computer time and it appears that the computer is
running everything at once. Some processes have a higher priority and
can get a bigger slice of time. On older &amp;#34;batch processing&amp;#34; systems,
high priority processes or jobs would run before lower priority
ones. For example, in a university setting, jobs submitted by
professors would be run before jobs submitted by grad students before
those submitted by undergrads. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This of course could lead to some processes never getting run if
higher priority jobs keep getting submitted. There&amp;#39;s an apocryphal
story about a computer at MIT that had a job submitted in 1967 but
still hadn&amp;#39;t run in 1973.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So what&amp;#39;s happening to me? I have a number of free books just sitting
on my kindle as well as books that I&amp;#39;ve purchased. My friend Paul said
I had to read &amp;#34;Algorithms to Live By&amp;#34; so that&amp;#39;s thre. So is &amp;#34;Captains
Courageous&amp;#34; because I think I want to read it. There are also a bunch of
others. The trouble is, I keep seeing books that I want to read in the
library and I only have a 28 day window to read them, Most recently it
was &amp;#34;Sapiens&amp;#34; but before that it was &amp;#34;Turn Right at Machi Picchu&amp;#34; and
I read that right after &amp;#34;How Chance and Stupidity Have Changed
History,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;The Witch of Lime Street.&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;The Man with the Sawed-Off
Leg and Other Tales of a New York City Block.&amp;#34; As soon as, or before I
finish one, there&amp;#39;s a new one on hold and then on loan and the books I
own keep getting pushed back.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Operating Systems usually implement process aging. If a job isn&amp;#39;t
handled fdor a long period of time its priority is increased. This
means that eventually it will be run. I guess I could do that and just
force myself to not read the next hot library book but I don&amp;#39;t kow if
I have that in me.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Busy Week</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/busy-week/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2019 07:32:49 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/busy-week/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m glad it&amp;#39;s Saturday morning. It&amp;#39;s been a busy week. It looks like
there&amp;#39;s a couple more to plough through but hopefully then I can catch
my breath over spring break.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why so busy? It&amp;#39;s the same old story - you&amp;#39;ve got all those projects
that you&amp;#39;re waiting on and everything comes in at the same time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start off, it&amp;#39;s college decision season. The high school seniors
all know their options and are deciding where to go. While we&amp;#39;re still
considering some applications to my Daedalus honors CS program, most
of the offers have gone out or will go out within a couple of days.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started the week with an info session about the program. eBay was
nice enough to host. I&amp;#39;ve held this session there now for the past
three years. First time, I had about 20 attendees and am not sure if
it made a difference in any high school senior&amp;#39;s decision. Last year
we had about 40 in the room but this year we reached capacity
at 65. Each senior was allowed to brign a +1. Some didn&amp;#39;t, many
brought a parent but a few brought a friend. At the end of the
session, most of the friends sought me out and asked if it was too
late to apply. I told them where to fill everything out but
unfortunately I didn&amp;#39;t know if I would be allowed to consider them or
not. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also had about 10 of my current students at the event. This was the
first time I was able to have that many. First time, I only had a
handful in the program and last year we first had to reschedule due to
weather and most of my students had class on the rain date. Having a
bunch of current students there to mix and talk with the applicants
was proabably the most important part of the evening. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end, the high schoolers had left and the students and I were
BSing along with Paul, our host when Paul offered a tour and then went
into an impromptu tech talk with the kids. I really
wanted to get home to bed but the kids were loving it so I let it
ride.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All in all it was a great night for my current students and I&amp;#39;m hoping
also for the high schoolers but it was a draining way to start the
week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also had a big CUNY2X event last week on Thursday evening. Around
50 students interviewing with fifteen or so companies for summer
internships. We&amp;#39;ve had this event three semesters in a row now. It&amp;#39;s a
long evening but at the end of the day lots of students get both
interviewing experience as well as offers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Things also started to move this past week on our CS Education
programs but not in a good way. Rather than approving our programs
they came back with a bunch of questions. It&amp;#39;s rather frustrating
since we cover everything they want and then some but they don&amp;#39;t seem
to be seeing it. For example, we&amp;#39;ve got a big chunk of our topics
course where we&amp;#39;ll essentially cover full stack development light and
we cover way in excess of anything in NY&amp;#39;s forthcoming standards on
networks and systems not to mention things like cybersecurity,
accessibility, UX and more in that unit but the state said they don&amp;#39;t see
any evidence to that effect. So I had too start to take our syllabi and bloat
them with excruciating detail. Something I&amp;#39;ll be doing over the
weekend and into next week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To add to the week I had to pack. I&amp;#39;ve been pushing for an office move
for about two years. When I came to Hunter they placed me physically
in the Ed school. It made sense - I&amp;#39;m officially appointed there but
I&amp;#39;ve done most of my work so far with CS. Even when my CSED programs
start, many of the students will be grad students or working teachers
so they won&amp;#39;t be on campus much except for when they teach. On the
other hand the CS undergrads are around all the time. Well, Monday I&amp;#39;m
moving to a new office right by the all the CS action. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s also been a busy semester for my course planning. I&amp;#39;m teaching
data structures at Hunter for the first time. I&amp;#39;ve taught it many
times before but that was to a known audience with a different
toolset - Java instead of C++. To be honest, I&amp;#39;m not particularly
happy with how I&amp;#39;ve been doing. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve been terrible but
I&amp;#39;ve left plenty of classes feeling I&amp;#39;ve missed my marks. I know
that it&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;ll have figured out and next time around I&amp;#39;ll be
back up to speed but it&amp;#39;s made planning and reflection more of a time
sink and it always bothers me when I don&amp;#39;t feel my students are
getting my best.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, it&amp;#39;s been a busy week in a busy semester. For the most part, good
things happening but I&amp;#39;m really looking forward to spring break.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Monitor</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/new-monitor/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2019 17:38:09 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/new-monitor/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;figure class=&amp;#34;z_image_right&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;img src=&amp;#34;/img/monitors.jpg&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;250px&amp;#34;/&amp;gt; 
&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Got a new monitor today and wanted to share.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My old one was a 27&amp;#34; Hanns G. Actually, the old ones - my old set up
was 2 of them side by side. When I started at Hunter, I was given a
piddly small monitor so I tried to buy my own 27&amp;#34; Hanns G to bring in
but they were no longer available. The 27&amp;#34; jobs available then were
much more expensive so my work monitor situation has been sadly
lacking.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The 2 27&amp;#34; setup worked pretty well but then I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/the-best-display-for-programming-8aad0be4227d&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; post and did a
little research. It turns out that Costco has a great deal on an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.costco.com/LG-43UD79-B-43%2522-Class-Ultra-HD-4K-IPS-Monitor.product.100378322.html&#34;&gt;LG
43&amp;#34; 4K&lt;/a&gt; monitor so I took the plunge. I also had to pick up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/EVGA-GeForce-Passive-Graphics-02G-P4-6332-KR/dp/B073VPKV26/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=gt+1030&amp;amp;qid=1552171987&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-3&#34;&gt;cheap
video card&lt;/a&gt; to drive it since I was just using onboard video and my
setup is pretty old.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s HUGE. I love it but am now working to figure out how best to set
things up. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The added bonus is that I can now bring one or both of the 27&amp;#34;
monitors to work!!!!!!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re on the  market for a new monitor I have to say that I&amp;#39;m
really happy with the LG. Just wanted to share.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#34;

      <title>Angels in the Architecture - when they used to build schools like cathedrals.</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/fall-2018-tour-benefits/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Jan 2019 07:31:07 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/fall-2018-tour-benefits/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
One of the side benefits of &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/fall-2018-tour-revisited/&#34;&gt;visiting high schools&lt;/a&gt; is that I end up
going all over the city. This takes me to neighborhoods that I
normally wouldn&amp;#39;t have reason to visit. For a New York History wonk
that can be pretty cool even if you just limit yourself to looking at
the schools. A few of the schools I visited in the last couple of
weeks before the new year were self contained whole building schools:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
James Madison
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Goddard High School
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
FDR HS
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Midwood HS
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Goddard was interesting because it was founded in 2008 and grew out of
the middle school in the same building. FDR was also interesting. It
was founded in 1965 which makes the building fairly young or at least
early middle aged for a New York City school building. When you
approach it, you see this small short modern looking one story structure:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fassets.nydailynews.com%2Fpolopoly_fs%2F1.1408243.1374717210!%2Fimg%2FhttpImage%2Fimage.jpg_gen%2Fderivatives%2Flandscape_635%2Fteacher25n-1-web.jpg&amp;amp;f=1&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hidden from view is the big rectangular tower that the entrance
connects to via a tunnel. I had an interesting conversation with the
school&amp;#39;s principal about how that came to be.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
James Madison and Midwood also have their own buildings and they are
both partially screened - that is, they have selective admissions for
at least a portion of their student population. FDR is particularly
interesting becuase it is frankly an &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; neighborhood
school that survived the destructive years of Bloomberg/Klein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other schools I visited in that span were all housed in schools
that had been closed during the Bloomberg/Klein years and new small
schools created in their place. The original buildings were:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thomas Jefferson
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Franklin K Lane
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Christopher Columbus
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Andrew Jackson
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the coolest parts about visiting the older buildings is that
they were built in a different time. You have elaborate lobbies of
marble and polished granite. Beautiful murals and ornate
auditoriums. Unique architectural features like the ramps on the first
floor in Thomas Jefferson or the foyer in Brooklyn Tech (a school I
visited earlier in the year).  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They also have school history. In many of the buildings the walls are
still adorned with names of notable alumni.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Christopher Columbus boasts Sal Mineo,  (Anne Bancroft), and, well,
David Berkowitz. Andrew Jackson does pretty well for basketball with
Bob Cousy, Lly Daniels, Boo Harvey, and recent Knick Kyle
O&amp;#39;Quinn. Woody Allen and Mimi Sheraton among others went to
Midwood. James Madison has a political bent with Bernie Sander, Ruth
Bader Ginsburg, and Chuck Schumer. Finally, Thomas Jefferson was home
to Sylvia Fine, David Daniel Kaminsky (that&amp;#39;s Danny Kaye to you), Paul
Mazrusky, Al Lewis, and others. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another tidbit I learned was about the history of Franklin K
Lane. Lane&amp;#39;s built in the Brooklyn Queens border. You can see the
hills of Forrest Park left from the last Ice Age rising up behind it
as you approach the building. Apparently there used to be a line of
paint denoting the border. Lane also saw a good deal of race related
turmoil throughout it&amp;#39;s history. I was talking to an alum during my
visit and he was telling me how that in his day, you either left the
building via the north entrance or the south one depending on your
crew and woe is he who got caught on the wrong side. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, many of the older buildings were part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration&#34;&gt;WPA&lt;/a&gt; from the New
Deal. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you do get a chance to go into an old school, take some time to
check out the architecture and the ghosts of the past.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll leave you with a couple of pictures from Brooklyn Tech - mostly
because they were easy to find.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Happy New Year 2019</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/new-year-2019/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 09:55:01 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/new-year-2019/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve never been much of a New Years person. I get up really early and
so don&amp;#39;t usually stay up late and more to the point, as any teacher
knows, the year really goes from September through June with that
really long much needed  weekend that you regular folks call July and
August tacked on to separate years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This whole January first thing is really more  of a half time break or
perhaps an intermission.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regardless, I did start the calendar year productively - it was
warm enough for a run and on my way back got my first &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.citibikenyc.com/bikeangels/&#34;&gt;Bike Angel&lt;/a&gt; point
of the month and year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since I see January 1 as more of a mid year point than a start, I&amp;#39;m
not going to reflect back on what was or project what will be but I do
have a few projects that I want to make some headway on before classes
resum in a few weeks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First and foremost, I&amp;#39;m teaching Data Structures for the first time at
Hunter. Sure, I&amp;#39;ve taught it dozens of times but this will be
different. I haven&amp;#39;t done it in C++ since 2003 and teaching it in
college twice a week Mon/Thu for about 1:15 is not the same as high
school where we meet every day for 0:43. I&amp;#39;ve already been boning up
on my C++. Templates are much more of a pain than I remember them and
I still much prefer toString to operator overloading. I think once
I&amp;#39;ve written some more code and am back up to speed I&amp;#39;ll have a lot of
fun with the class.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other big project is that I want to make some progress on an
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/time-to-create-an-ethics-course/&#34;&gt;Ethics course&lt;/a&gt; that I want to have as part of my soon to be approved (I
hope) pre-service programs. I also want to make it available to
undergrads. I&amp;#39;ve been collecting thoughts and ideas for a couple of
months now and while I still believe that ethics is too important to
just be contained within a course - it must be woven through all our
courses, I do think I&amp;#39;ve got an overall plan that will result in a
very solid course.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are a couple of other projects I&amp;#39;m working on that I Can&amp;#39;t talk
about right now but I have no doubt I&amp;#39;ll be keeping myself busy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So to all the teachers out there, Happy Half Time and to everyone
else, Happy New Year.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Catskills Conf -  Knitting for Good 2018</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/catskills-blanket-2018/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Oct 2018 17:00:55 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/catskills-blanket-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Two weekends ago I took a group of my first year students up to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://catskillsconf.com&#34;&gt;Catskills Conf&lt;/a&gt;, an annual event that I describe as &amp;#34;light tech
conference with a focus on diversity and inclusion meets summer camp.&amp;#34;
I&amp;#39;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/catskills-2017/&#34;&gt;written about&lt;/a&gt; the event before if anyone&amp;#39;s interested in more
details. As in past years, Devorah ran her &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/knitting-tech-conference/&#34;&gt;knitting for good&lt;/a&gt;
project. In each of the first two years of the project, attendees of
Catskills Conf learned how to know and collectively knit, crocheted
and assembled a blanket for Project Linux which provides hand made
blankets to children in crisis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This year we made two:
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Ta Da! Presenting the blankets created by the participants of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/catskillsconf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt;  2018 for &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ProjectLinus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@ProjectLinus&lt;/a&gt;  Burgundy yarn courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ShaarayTefilaNY?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@ShaarayTefilaNY&lt;/a&gt;  Sanctuary Stitchers. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/MiEGmGGcqG&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/MiEGmGGcqG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Devorah Zamansky (@DevorahZamansky) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DevorahZamansky/status/1056636588837556225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;October 28, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I was off this morning &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/diane_levitt/status/1056560530956214272&#34;&gt;talking&lt;/a&gt; to high school students at
Cornell Technion, Devorah was finishing off the blankets and
delivering them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In past years, the blanket was usually mostly made by a small handful
of experienced knitters who attended the conference. This year was
very different. For the first time, many of my students took part in
the project.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/cconf-knitting-2018.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250&#34; height=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/cconf-knitting-2018-2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250&#34; height=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A few already knew how to know but more were learning for the first
time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I love that were at a tech conference and at the same time learning to
be creative with our hands and all the while doing some good for
others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Already looking forward to next year.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Once again, it&amp;#39;s time for &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventofcode.com&#34;&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; - a series of small
programming problems released once a day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I wrote a bit about it &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-12-15-advent.html/&#34;&gt;last&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-12-17-im-an-idiot.html/#.WEMqBB9ieYQ&#34;&gt;year&lt;/a&gt; and you can still find last years
problems &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventofcode.com/2015/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s only day three but so far, all of the problems look really nice
for students in APCS-A or any similar intro course. I&amp;#39;m thinking of
looking at a couple of the problems this week with my class at Hunter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t think about this much last year but one thing I really like
about the competition is that each problem comes in two parts. You&amp;#39;re
first presented with the problem and the input and once you put in the
correct answer, you&amp;#39;re presented with part two.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This can be annoying at times, particularly when it requires a large
code rewrite but it also means that well designed, not too specific
solutions are rewarded.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s not quite the same as changing the specs on a project mid way but
it does encourage thinking about more than just solving a super
specific problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventofcode.com&#34;&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; and see if it&amp;#39;s something you or your classes
might enjoy.

      <title>Hunter College - Honors CS</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-03-29-hunter-cs/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-03-29-hunter-cs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s been a while since my last post and a while since I started at
Hunter.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Time to share a bit about what I&#39;ve been up to.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One of the better kept secrets in New York City is Hunter College&#39;s
computer science program. It&#39;s been around for years and it&#39;s been
that way for years. In fact, when I was looking to get my masters
degree back in the mid nineties I carefully researched all of the
area&#39;s MS in CS programs. It came down to Hunter College and Courant
Institute at NYU. I was going to go with Hunter since the programs
seemed comparable and Hunter was far more affordable but I had to go
with NYU due to class schedules. Too many of the Hunter offerings were
to early in the day and I had my full time teaching job to consider.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hunter isn&#39;t currently offering their Masters program but their
Bachelor of Arts program is alive and well, it&#39;s just that people
don&#39;t know about it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Part of my job is to change that.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Well, not really, part of my job is to add my piece to the puzzle. The
rest will take care of itself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My piece? It&#39;s all about creating a tech culture, tying into the NY
Tech ecosystem, and filling in the gaps that are shared by just about
every college computer science program.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
How do we do it?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The long term plan is that we&#39;re starting a new CS Honors program. In
the fall, I&#39;ll be teaching and mentoring a group of entering
undergrads. We&#39;ll have workshops, trips, activities. You name it. I&#39;ll
also be teaching them modified versions of our courses with the hope
of bringing some of my modifications back to the rest of the student
body. Things like integrating real tools and professional techniques
into what is already a solid academic program.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the mean time, I&#39;m getting to know Hunter&#39;s current CS students and
working to energize the existing community.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We already had an amazing event hosted at &lt;a href=&#34;http://yext.com&#34;&gt;Yext&lt;/a&gt;. We had a panel and
mixer with representatives from about a dozen companies talking to the
kids about the possibilities ahead of them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We&#39;ve also set up a couple of workshops in house.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m also starting to talk to friends at companies across the city to
plan out both curriculum and programs to set up our kids to
succeed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My goal is that within five years, I want people to realize that
Hunter CS is the place to be for CS Education in NYC. Not everyone can
afford the 40K and up private college tuition and there&#39;s no reason to
when you can get a great CS education with ties to the tech community
at CUNY prices.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you want to help, drop me a note. We&#39;re looking to start something
very special and you have a chance to be a part of it.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Leaving Stuyvesant</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-12-23-leaving-stuy/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-12-23-leaving-stuy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Almost twenty six years. That&#39;s how long I&#39;ve been a NYC public school
teacher. Most of that time at my alma mater, Stuyvesant.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A couple of years ago, the school paper wrote up an overview of my
career. I re-posted it &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/2014/09/17/stuycs-spectator.html#.Vnqfxh8Sr0o&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;m somtimes amazed at where we are now
and how we got here.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Regulars here also know my frustrations. To Stuy, I&#39;m an
interchangeable, generic math teacher and the DOE has shown no
interested in supporting what we&#39;ve built. I&#39;ve also written about my
concerns with the direction the city&#39;s going with respect to K12 CS
education.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It was time for me to start the next phase of my career.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m happy to say that I will be joining Hunter College in late
January. I&#39;ll be developing their CS Teacher Ed program and also
working with their computer science undergrads. I&#39;ll also have the
opportunity to work with the Manhattan/Hunter Science High School and
Hunter College High School.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also look forward to the opportunity to work more closely with my
friends in the K12 Ed space.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m very excited about this opportunity but it feels a bit weird after
being in the same place for so long. I don&#39;t feel any special
attachment to the institution that is Stuyvesant, my allegiance is to
my current and former students and that community isn&#39;t going
anywhere. Next year I&#39;ll still be working with terrific young people,
just in a different location under a different name.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I will miss the team that we&#39;ve put together but even then, we get to
continue our work with CSTUY.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With the new year comes new opportunity and I can&#39;t wait.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Has everyone seen &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventofcode.com/&#34;&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s a site with a series of programming problems that are being
revealed one a day, a la an advent calendar. You can read more about
it &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventofcode.com/about&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I came to the party a little late so I&#39;m only up to day 6.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Each problem comes in two parts. The second is revealed after you
complete the first. Both students and teachers are enjoying the
problems.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What I like about the Advent of code, besides the one a day release,
is the fact that at least so far, the problems aren&#39;t super crazy
hard. They require a little thought but they seem very doable.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For me, that makes them a perfect platform on which to play with a new
language. I&#39;m working through these in Clojure. I&#39;ve been putting my
solutions up &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/adventofcodeclojure&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I have no idea if my code is &#34;good&#34; Clojure but
it&#39;s been fun nonetheless.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, if you&#39;re looking for a nice set of small programming problems
and want to explore something new, check it out.

      <title>Finding the Bell Tower</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-11-06-bell-tower/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-11-06-bell-tower/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
No Edu-Rant today nor a clever lesson plan.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I just thought I&#39;d share an email exchange that cracked me up.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
We&#39;re out in Ann Arbor visiting our son Natan who is in his first year at Michigan.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Devorah sent an email asking where we should meet.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It turns out that Natan&#39;s last class of the day is Music Composition.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here&#39;s what followed:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Natan:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Composition is in the bell tower on Central. It&#39;s hard to miss. It&#39;s a
bell tower. It&#39;s right by Hill Auditorium, and looks like a bell
tower. It also sounds like a bell tower at certain points in the day,
but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard it sound like a bell tower around the end
of class, so you&#39;re probably better off looking for the thing that
looks like a bell tower rather than listening for the thing that
sounds like a bell tower. I would assume it also smells and tastes
like a bell tower, but if you&#39;re in close enough proximity to smell or
taste the bell tower, I think you&#39;ve probably found the bell tower. It
looks like a huggable building, but please, dad, do not hug the bell
tower. I have class there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Devorah:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We can meet you at the bell tower as long as we can figure out what it
looks like.  Can you please give us a detailed description? Maybe
you should taste it just in case.  Does the bell tower on Central
smell like the bell tower on North?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Natan:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The bell tower is around the size and shape of a bell tower. It&#39;s ten
stories high, with the first nine stories being a little less than
one-tenth of a bell tower tall, and the tenth being rather more than
one-tenth of a bell tower tall (the tenth story being where the bells
are). The width is about equal to that of a bell tower. It has two
doors, one on one side of the bell tower, and the other on the other
side of the bell tower. It has clock faces on top, which should, at
the point you see it, resemble a clock face indicating the time which
it is. (The appearance of the clock faces should update in near-real
time.) If you stick around long enough, it should start to sound like
a bell tower, or perhaps like a monster descending the stairs singing
Gilbert and Sullivan. I don&#39;t know what the bell tower on North smells
like because the bell tower on North is currently blocked off. But it
also resembles a bell tower, being approximately the same size and
shape of a bell tower. It is much less likely to sound like a bell
tower, though.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Coding schools - or why I chose NYCDA</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-10-12-nycda/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-10-12-nycda/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-orgheadline1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;orgheadline1&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-orgheadline1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some of you might have noticed that a few months ago, I decided to
affiliate myself with &lt;a href=&#34;http://nycda.com/&#34;&gt;The New York Code and Design Academy&lt;/a&gt; or NYCDA. I
took on the role of &#34;Academic Director, Youth Programs.&#34; It&#39;s a part
time gig, at least for now and I&#39;m helping them develop their programs
for middle and high school students.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why did I choose them?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are a number of coding schools with varying levels of hype
around them. At their core, all are workforce programs. They take
people with little or no programming background and after a few months
of intensive training, they ship them off as web devs or the like.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-orgheadline2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;orgheadline2&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-orgheadline2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have friends at many of these coding schools and related programs so
what was different about NYCDA that made me decide to work with them?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
They know who they are, they know what they do, they know where they
want to go, and we all feel I can help them get there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-orgheadline3&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;orgheadline3&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-orgheadline3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let me explain.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Most coding schools follow the same mold.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For one reason or another, a founder decides to start teaching a
class. This works pretty well so it starts to grow into a
business. For many of these coding schools, the teaching staff comes
from the program&#39;s own graduates.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The key point here is that most coding schools have little to no
interaction with real, experienced educators.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, why do they work? Well, to start, there&#39;s plenty of low hanging
fruit. Right now, as these programs are in high demand,  programs can
cream top applicants.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Many programs also have applicants complete
pre-work - that is a program of self study before starting the coding
school. This pretty much ensures that your classes are going to be
composed of hard working, intelligent self starters - that&#39;s a recipe
for a successful student body.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Given the student population and the fact that the skill set for an
entry level programmer can be taught fairly formulaicaly, it&#39;s a recipe
for success.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, I don&#39;t mean to imply that these schools are bad or doing bad
things - all of them are taking people and giving them a chance at a
new career. It&#39;s good and it&#39;s important. Even more so for
organizations that provide a step up for the have nots.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Teaching kids is another matter.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For adults you&#39;re teaching a specific skill set for a specific job
market. For kids, you&#39;re setting a foundation and opening doors. You
can&#39;t just take your adult model and apply it to kids. Well, you can,
and it will even look good, but it won&#39;t have real substance.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That&#39;s what impressed me about NYCDA - when &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jeremysnepar&#34;&gt;Jeremy&lt;/a&gt; came to me it was
clear - they knew what they did and what they did well. He also knew
that as they ramp up their youth offerings, it was important to
involve real, experienced educators - that it was about having true
expert teachers even more than it was curriculum. He understood that
while NYCDA is doing a great job, how much better could it be to
include CS educators who have been sending kids into industry
successfully for years.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was even more delighted when my partner in crime JonAlf
Dyrland-Weaver - one of the best teachers I know, CS or otherwise,
agreed to teach one of our NYCDA youth courses this semester.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
NYCDA is the only coding school working to bring the best teachers out
there to their youth programs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That&#39;s why I joined on and that&#39;s why I&#39;m really excited for the
programs we&#39;re going to roll out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-orgheadline1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-orgheadline1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This past week, Garth Flint wrote a couple of posts on how he
got to be a CS teacher and on being a CS teacher. You can find them here:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;org-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gflint.wordpress.com/2015/10/07/so-you-want-to-be-a-cs-teacher-part-1/&#34;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gflint.wordpress.com/2015/10/08/so-you-want-to-be-a-cs-teacher-part-2/&#34;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
They&#39;re both well worth a read.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It got me thinking about how I got my start.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I never planned on being a teacher. I figured I&#39;d just work in
tech. After working my way through college, fresh CS degree in hand, I
landed at Goldman Sachs. I had other opportunities but the tech scene
was very different. You could (basically):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;org-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work for a financial house or insurance company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do niche consulting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;travel out of the city to Bellcore, AT&amp;amp;T or IBM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Well, I didn&#39;t drive and wasn&#39;t going to do consulting so I ended up
on Wall Street. I worked there for a bit but it didn&#39;t do it for me,
then tried a consulting gig. No better. Wall street never appealed to
me and at the time, more programming type jobs involved you working
alone on a computer in an office or a cube all day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, for no particular reason, I decided to give teaching a go.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I always wonder, if I had come along a few years later if I would have
stayed in pure tech.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I had zero teaching credentials but there was a math teacher shortage
at the time. By taking a couple of CS classes as math classes
(numerical methods, algorithms) they justified giving me temporary
license. I would have to take a handful of Ed credits within a couple
of years and later get a masters (which I knew would be in CS, no way
was I getting an Education degree).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-orgheadline2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;orgheadline2&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-orgheadline2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, I started at Seward Park High School as a math teacher. Best thing
that could have happened to me. I was working with an incredibly
diverse population - high achieving kids, low achieving kids,
immigrants, multi-generational Americans, delightful kids and kids on
parole. That&#39;s where I developed my chops.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Knowing that I was a CS guy the math chairman started having me teach
the basic programming course and later APCS.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A couple of years later, I was bumped to Stuy. Taught math and the
rest of my history can be seen &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/2014/09/17/stuycs-spectator.html#.VhfhBt8qcbw&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Garth talks about requirements and Alfred Thompson, in his &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2015/10/an-inside-look-at-being-computer.html&#34;&gt;link to
Garth&#39;s posts&lt;/a&gt; talks about the problems of CS teacher isolation. It
took a long time and it was hard work, but I started in a school with
no CS to speak and no CS teachers and now we have a required course,
between six and 10 CS teachers depending on the year, and a thoroughly
oversubscribed program. Of course, if you&#39;re at a small school, you
can&#39;t really do that. I remember in the early years, when it came to
course signup time, I&#39;d have to visit every math class in the building
on one day to hock my courses. I&#39;m glad those days are gone.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Garth also makes a great point about all there is to learn as a real
CS teacher. The best math teachers I know love doing math and love
solving problems but by and large, they&#39;re not learning new subfields
every year. Over my time as a teacher I&#39;ve learned, either by choice
or necessity:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&#34;org-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new fields such as
&lt;ul class=&#34;org-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;relearning AI, which is radically different then when I was in
college&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data mining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OOP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HCI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new languages
&lt;ul class=&#34;org-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C++&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Javascript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Haskell (a bit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And tons of technologies
&lt;ul class=&#34;org-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unix as a toolset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;system administration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;network administration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Git
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and many more.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, since I do work with many other CS teachers, I
might be a little bit of an outlier. Some of my colleagues also work
to keep current and learn new things while others are content with
their knowledge base and are happy to teach what they&#39;re currently
teaching. That&#39;s not to say that they don&#39;t work on their craft, but
rather, they&#39;re in a comfort zone of knowledge.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So what&#39;s next? As initiatives like CS4All progress, CS education will
become more formalized. You all know my fear about the current
efforts - CS Ed will go the way of Math Ed and we&#39;ll be left with Meh
CS education for all. If that&#39;s the case, and I hope I&#39;m wrong, many
of Garth&#39;s issues will disappear. CS across the nation will become
more generic but more accessible and CS teachers will hopefully know
how to teach their courses but maybe not too much more.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Even if that is the case, there will hopefully still be places for us
old time gluttons for punishment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>I guess some people like the blues</title>

&lt;p&gt;
Funny story from yesterday.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Devorah, my better half, is an assistant principal at another high
school. Yesterday evening, she was at work late for &#34;curriculum
night.&#34; Parents came to the school after hours to hear a variety of
presentations.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
During her presentation, Devorah mentioned her name, that she had two
former public school kids in college, and that&#39;s about it for the
personal info.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After the session, two parents approached Devorah to say &#34;we&#39;re big
fans of your husband!&#34;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Since when do teachers have fans?????????
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I mean, I understand &#34;my daughter/son was in your husbands class and
really enjoyed it,&#34; but &#34;I&#39;m a big fan?&#34; She wasn&#39;t sure how to take
it. Obviously we both took it as an honor and compliment but we also
both got a chuckle out of the turn of phrase.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ve already said that teachers aren&#39;t &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/2014/12/14/rockstar-godfather.html#.Vg264t8Sr0o&#34;&gt;rock stars, we&#39;re blues men&lt;/a&gt; so
I guess this shows that some folks still like the blues.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Suspension if disbelief and the Mikado</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-09-21-mikado/</link>

      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was brought up on Gilberg and Sullvan. My father, who always wanted
to be an opera singer sang with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Opera_of_Manhattan&#34;&gt;LOOM&lt;/a&gt; back in the day and there was
always classical music playing. Either from the Hi Fi or my father
singing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Recently, there&#39;s been a kerfufle over what was to be &lt;a href=&#34;http://nygasp.org&#34;&gt;NYGASP&#39;s&lt;/a&gt;
production of Mikado.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My son, Natan wrote a terrific blog post on it and the suspension of
belief in opera. It&#39;s long but well worth a read.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you like G&amp;amp;S or opera in general, take a look.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://seccorecit.blogspot.com/2015/09/imagine-if-you-will.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Enjoy.

&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;photo&#34; src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/just_another_day/pic.jpg&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Last post was a little heavy so just a short fun one for today.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&#34;Just another day at StuyCS.&#34; That was the subject of the email Brian
sent with the photo above. What&#39;s going on?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We&#39;re working on advanced JavaScript while also looking at
&lt;i&gt;Backbone.js&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, as sometimes happens, Batya, while in her CS class up at college,
decided to open up a Google chat with me. This happens now and then. We try to
have some fun with it. We actually have a plan to mess with the kids
later this term, but I&#39;ll keep that to myself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, Batya, of course, was sitting in her CS class in college. I told
her what we were doing and continued with the lesson.  She responded
that Zach, her boyfriend and my former student said not to forget to
emphasize certain things. I also asked Batya if her professor was
having a chat with his kid while he was teaching. Everyone was having a
laugh.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then things got sillier. Another chat popped up. It was Natan, my son,
who happens to be in that class. So, the insanity continued on when I
get a video call -  it was from Aida sitting in row 1 - that&#39;s what you
see on the screen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now it was getting a little ridiculous and it all started with Batya
and Natan. So, what&#39;s a a teacher to do? I had to contact their
parent, my wife, to tell her to discipline her children. That&#39;s the
third chat.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, just another day at StuyCS.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A chocolate treasure in a city losing its soul</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-02-13-myzels/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-02-13-myzels/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https:/img/myzels/myzels.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;myzels.jpg&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m a born and bred New Yorker and more and more I&#39;m lamenting what
the city&#39;s becoming.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
New York used to be a collection of neighborhoods. Yes, we were the
city that never slept, but there were scores of mom and pop stores,
sole proprieterships. You could become a &#34;regular.&#34; I&#39;m reminded of
Tom Shachman&#39;s book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Around-The-Block-Business-Neighborhood/dp/0151000778&#34;&gt;Around the Block&lt;/a&gt; which looks at the businesses
around a single NYC block, mostly all gone now. If you can get your
hands on the book. It&#39;s worth a read.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In any event, here&#39;s a story:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday. JonAlf and I were at the Apple store on Fifth avenue talking about
&lt;a href=&#34;http://cstuy.org/&#34;&gt;CSTUY&lt;/a&gt;. We had four of our talented students presenting their work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After the event, JonAlf had gone and one of our student presenters had
left with his parents. I was left with our other three presenters.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I told them that I&#39;d love to take them by this amazing chocolate shop
a few blocks away and I had to explain why:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https:/img/myzels/candy.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;candy.jpg&#34; /&gt;]]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A number of years ago, after a morning in Central Park, Batya, Natan,
and I were winding our way home. We ended up passing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.myzels.com/&#34;&gt;Myzel&#39;s
Chocolates&lt;/a&gt; on the south side of 55th street between fifth and sixth
avenue. That&#39;s when we met Kamila, the shop owner. We chatted for a
while got some chocolate and went on our way. Kamila was amazingly
warm and sincere and the chocolates really really good. I noted that
we would have to return.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https:/img/myzels/kamila.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;kamila.jpg&#34; /&gt;]]
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
That didn&#39;t happen until months later but when it did, I was shocked
that Kamila remembered us, what we were doing that day and we just
picked up the conversation where we left off.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This pattern repeated over the years. We didn&#39;t get to that
neighborhood and thus Myzel&#39;s often, but whenever we did, we had to
stop by. Great candies from a truly special person.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Alas, my schedule has been such that I hadn&#39;t been back to Myzel&#39;s in
years. I think three or four.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, I was with Nadia, Miranda, and Leslie - three of my incredibly
talented students. They just did an awesome job presenting their work
and I figured I could give them some thank you chocolate as well as
visit one of my  favorite places in the city.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I told them that Kamila probably wouldn&#39;t remember me but I recounted
my story of Myzel&#39;s and how amazing Kamila and the store were. I got
the feeling that they didn&#39;t believe me when I told them about Kamila
and the store.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We got to Myzel&#39;s went in and started to place our order. When Kamila
came out, her first word to me was &#34;professor&amp;#x2026;&#34; and we picked up
where we left off. As usual, she was charming and sincere. We
reminisced and chatted and then we were off.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In a city that&#39;s fast becoming cookie cutter we need more places like
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.myzels.com/&#34;&gt;Myzel&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; and more people like Kamila.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately rents are rapidly dispatching shops like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.myzels.com/&#34;&gt;Myzel&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; and
people like Kamila are few and far between.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, when you&#39;re around City Center or midtown in general, please treat
yourself. You won&#39;t be disappointed.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CS Ed Predictions 2015</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-01-04-predictions-2015/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-01-04-predictions-2015/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I just read &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alfredtwo&#34;&gt;Alfred Thompson&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; predictions for next year. I was going
to leave a comment but since it would have gotten somewhat long
winded, I thought I&#39;d comment in a post of my own.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you haven&#39;t read Alfred&#39;s post yet, check it out:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2015/01/computer-science-education-predictions.html&#34;&gt;http://blog.acthompson.net/2015/01/computer-science-education-predictions.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-unnumbered-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unnumbered-1&#34;&gt;On more states allowing CS to count for a graduation requirement:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-unnumbered-1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Alfred&#39;s probably right but I&#39;m leery. Sure, it could end up terrific
but I could see a number of ways this could play out badly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We could end up with non-cs classes to count as CS or we could see
schools allowing real CS to count but there would be no incentive for
a school to actually create any meaningful CS classes
much less for kids to take them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I guess the root of my concern probably relates two of my concerns
about education in general:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&#34;org-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real, experienced teachers aren&#39;t driving policy in education in
general and CS is and will  be no different. We&#39;re going to be left
with something forced down from above and I fear it will be bad.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&#34;org-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;m not a big fan of education education. As schools of education
get involved they will have more of a voice. I think one of the
worst things to happen to math education over the course of my
career has been &#34;Math Ed.&#34; I fear CS Ed will have the same effect
on K12 CS education.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Maybe I&#39;m a pessimist or maybe I&#39;ve just been burned one to many times
or maybe it&#39;s that as a public school teacher I see the negative
effect of politics and money on public education but at least in NYC I
see where the decision making is coming from and I&#39;m not encouraged.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, even if I&#39;m right and the powers that be really
screw things up,there should always be at least a few people who see
through they hype and that&#39;s where I can continue to do positive work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-unnumbered-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unnumbered-2&#34;&gt;On Python continuing to grow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-unnumbered-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s been one of my go to languages for a while now. I&#39;ve been using
it in and out of classes since some time in the mid 90s.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don&#39;t see it replacing Java in AP CS and it looks like Scratch has
the inside track CS Principles but it&#39;s good for so many things and
has such a low cost of entry, I again feel that Alfred&#39;s right.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The fact that it&#39;s easy for a non-cs teacher to pick up, at least to a
limited degree, will certainly help the charge. I&#39;m not sure if long
term, this is a good thing, but it will help to push python&#39;s growth in education.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a side note on Java &amp;#x2013; I&#39;m not personally a fan, but there good things in there that would be lost
with a total shift to languages like Python.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-unnumbered-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unnumbered-3&#34;&gt;On CS Principles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-unnumbered-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I do see a time where the course is forced on Stuy but I&#39;m
not worrying about it for the moment. I think we already teach a
stronger course and by the time CS Principles becomes an issue at
Stuy, I&#39;ll probably be gone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-unnumbered-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unnumbered-4&#34;&gt;Chromebooks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-unnumbered-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I could see chromebooks working out for CS but only if schools don&#39;t
lock them down. Out of the box, you can only use cloud based
development environments. This is surely limiting but if you have the bandwidth, between
&lt;a href=&#34;http://codesters.com/&#34;&gt;codesters.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://koding.com/&#34;&gt;koding.com&lt;/a&gt;, cloud9, Dr.Racket and assorted other tools
you can certainly do some good CS.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The upside comes when you can drop into the Linux shell. I&#39;ve been
playing with a C720 Intel chromebook recently. It&#39;s small and
lightweight and once I set it up, it was running Dr. Racket, NetLogo,
Python, Java, Processing (all with a fairly hefty Emacs install).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Will it run everything? I don&#39;t know, but if I can get a new lab of
computers and have the freedom to custom install the machines, I&#39;m
seriously considering chromebooks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m also recommending them to my kids looking for a cheap portable
development environment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-unnumbered-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unnumbered-5&#34;&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34; id=&#34;text-unnumbered-5&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ve never been one for my own predictions - maybe because I&#39;m more of
a continuous journey rather than destination type of guy so I&#39;ll hold
off on my own predictions for now, but I&#39;ll close with a direct
shoutout &amp;#x2013; Hey Alfred - thanks for posting your predictions - good food for thought
as is your blog in general.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Spent most of vacation relaxing. Finished off the remaining college
recs, tried to catch up on sleep, and worked on a few project.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We&#39;ve had an interesting December break dynamic in our household for
the past few years. My son, Natan is very much into his music, both as
a performer and a composer. A few years ago we discovered &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.livingtraditions.org/docs/index_kk.htm&#34;&gt;KlezKamp&lt;/a&gt;. It
spoke to both Natan and Devorah. Batya, coming back from college
wasn&#39;t so into it and I was somewhat indifferent.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The end result is that for most of the first half of the break, Batya
and I were left on our own in the city while Natan and Devorah were up
in the Catskills.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, what did we do? In addition to playing tourist, we rebuilt the
CSTUY web site (with a little help from her boyfriend Zach) - check it
out: &lt;a href=&#34;http://cstuy.org/&#34;&gt;cstuy.org&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;m really happy with the result and now have a code
base that I&#39;m happy with and can maintain.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I can&#39;t describe how awesome it is to be able to collaborate on
something real with ones daughter and I hope we can work on more
projects in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, I had my Natan time when he and Devorah got home. We spent
new years eve at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://nygasp.org/&#34;&gt;NYGASP&lt;/a&gt; production of HMS Pinafore. Natan loves
opera and is something of a Savoyard and he&#39;s also a terrific
singer. Something he must have inherited from my father, although he
never met him.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, we had our own project:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;450&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34;
src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/184357024&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;visual=true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
His is the good voice singing Dick Deadeye and I&#39;m the not so good one
doing Captain Corcoran. We recorded it A Capella and he added the midi
after the fact. I think he had to change the key and I&#39;m sure he had
to mess with the tempo.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some of you might have noticed that I worked on the tech project with
Batya and the artsy one with Natan but don&#39;t worry - Natan&#39;s planning
on majoring in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/NZamansky&#34;&gt;Computer Science&lt;/a&gt; and Batya&#39;s the musical director and
an alto in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thechainotes.com/&#34;&gt;The
Chai Notes&lt;/a&gt; up at Cornell.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So that was my break. Back to work in a couple of days.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A birds eye view of my career</title>

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s hard to believe that this is my 25th year teaching and that my
first StuyCS class graduated in June 1995. It&#39;s really hard to believe
that I&#39;m now looking at the end of a significant part of my life and
career.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Over the summer, Mariya, Kachun, and Stella, all writers for Stuy&#39;s
Spectator worte an article that chronicled StuyCS. It&#39;s a really nice
piece. It skirted the battles I&#39;ve had and the fact that we get no
love or support from Stuy or the DOE, but still, as I said, it&#39;s a
really nice piece.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
the original can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stuyspec.com/features/how-to-hack-yourself-a-class&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but I&#39;ve copied the article (with
permission) below.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Two decades in about two pages.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy.

&lt;p&gt;
By Mariya Gedrich, Kachun Leung, and Stella Ma
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Imagine Stuyvesant without a computer science program. Aspire to pursue a career in software development? Nope, but perhaps you could go into the ever-lucrative handmade telescope business after taking a telescope assembly class. Want to explore all the features of your laptop? Well, that‚Äôs probably not happening at school. Want to take Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science? Good luck getting into that one class taught by that one teacher. If this seems like a hassle to you, it was definitely a problem 20 years ago when this was the reality.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today, every Stuyvesant student is expected to graduate with at least one semester of Introductory Computer Science, and for those who are interested in continuing with the course, there are plenty of classes offered. In fact, AP Computer Science is one of the most sought after classes every year. Last year, around 400 students applied to take the class, and an extra section had to be added to accommodate the disappointed students who did not get in. In 1994, however, Stuyvesant had only a few classes dedicated to the use and study of computers. There was no official computer science program other than one AP Computer Science class taught by a math teacher who was much more passionate about teaching math than about teaching computers.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
A new math teacher at the time, Michael Zamansky, was teaching geometry. Zamansky, felt out of place teaching a math class. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a mathematician, I‚Äôm a computer scientist,‚Äù Zamansky explained. Before long, it was clear that the switch was inevitable. Zamansky enthusiastically recalls the day he was taken out of a class to talk to math chairman Richard Rothenberg: The previous teacher said, ‚Äú‚ÄòRichie, I don‚Äôt want to teach computer science‚ÄîMike does.‚Äô‚Äù
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And that was when the ball started rolling.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the fall of 1994, Zamansky started teaching the AP Computer Science class. In turn, enrollment skyrocketed as there was now an enthusiastic and passionate teacher. Juniors and seniors filled four sections of the class, more than ever before.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The classes fostered a new interest in computer science among students. Feeling that there was much more to be done with this new enthusiasm, Zamansky asked his class if they‚Äôd like to have a spring class in Systems Programming, a class in which students would learn about memory organization, interrupts, and computer representation of numbers. Although both his students and the administration approved of this idea, Zamansky was unable to fit the class into the students‚Äô 8-period schedules, especially since they had other commitments like math team in the morning. The solution came when students volunteered to stay an extra period after school, making Systems Programming a ninth period class. Students readily signed up; Zamansky was now staying after school every day with a group of students eager to learn. Noticing how popular the Systems Programming class was, Zamansky decided to create a fall semester supplementary course in Advanced Computer Graphics, in which he taught students how to use C and Pascal. Because of the popularity of these classes, the electives were incorporated into the schedule and staying after school was no longer necessary by the fall of 1995.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The classes proved to be a massive success. Computer science students were getting involved in international competitions, claiming top spots wherever they went. The result of the newly formed computer science classes was a very close-knit subculture. All of his students shared a common interest and now had a venue for developing it. ‚ÄúThat cohort from Mike‚Äôs first class really bonded as a group,‚Äù recalled alumnus Yu Ping Hu (‚Äô95) in an e-mail interview. ‚ÄúI remember cutting all my classes for days on end to spend time in the lab with other kids in the class to work on our projects and hang out (and Mike kicking us out when he found out about it, not that it stopped us from doing it again when he wasn‚Äôt in the room).‚Äù In addition, ‚ÄúHackers,‚Äù a film about a young boy who was arrested for writing a computer virus, was filmed at Stuyvesant, and a real life hacking incident took place. These events helped create traditions and lore for that community, according to Hu.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Zamansky also helped foster a community by teaching with a fun, playful attitude. According to former computer science teacher and alumnus Boris Granovskiy, students and teachers constantly played pranks on each other. ‚ÄúI definitely remember one day when there were several bake sales at Stuy, and so Mr. Zamansky and some of my friends bought up a bunch of pies and ambushed me when I got to the classroom, leading to a chase around the classroom and a lot of flying pastry,‚Äù he recalled.The annual Halloween tradition of all the computer science teachers dressing up and performing skits for their classes has its roots in Zamansky‚Äôs enthusiasm for dressing up in an elaborate costume. ‚ÄúThe first year I taught, Mr. Zamansky and I dressed up as Hans and Franz from Saturday Night Live and walked around trying to teach in character the entire day,‚Äù Granovskiy recalls. The following year they both dressed up as the Hulk and had to somehow teach by only using grunting noises.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Even though a vibrant culture had formed around the classes, only a small portion of the student body was a part of it. ‚ÄúA lot of kids won‚Äôt even think about computer science,‚Äù Zamansky explained. The ones who did, however, often fell in love with it. Alumnus and computer software developer Anita Verma remembers how she originally took Zamansky‚Äôs Introduction to Computer Science (Intro) class when it was an elective during her sophomore year. ‚ÄúI had heard great things about Mr. Zamansky, and I always loved computers, so I was very excited to take his class,‚Äù she said in an email interview. Although computer science was new to her, she quickly became fond of the class. ‚ÄúClasses never felt like a grind, like most of my other classes did. Looking back at these classes now, I understand that this is what learning is supposed to feel like, when you find something that you are passionate about,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI retained everything I learned in those classes, and used that as the foundation of the computer science education I would receive at college and in the workplace.‚Äù
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Verma is just one of many of Zamansky‚Äôs students who have gone on to have jobs in the tech industry, with some working at Google and others at the National Security Agency. ‚ÄúWhen one of my students got his doctorate, he gave me a copy of [it], and he‚Äôs a good friend of mine now‚Ä¶when another student wrote a book, I‚Äôm in the acknowledgments,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo I know these guys appreciate me but I‚Äôm like, ‚Äòcan‚Äôt I do more?‚Äô‚Äù
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That was when Zamansky decided to pursue a required Intro class for all students by what he considered ‚Äúhacking‚Äù the school‚Äôs system. He started working on his idea for this program in 1997, but did not get the chance to make it a reality until 2002, when drafting teacher Timothy Pon left Stuyvesant. Since Pon left behind a drafting class, Zamansky was able to swoop in and substitute one of his Intro classes for the drafting class as a graduation requirement, a move that pleased a large portion of the student body. ‚ÄúStudents began to say, ‚ÄòHey, this is ridiculous. Computer science is so much more valuable,‚Äô since the whole idea was that we want to give you the basic tools to inspire you and get you to think like a computer scientist,‚Äù Zamansky said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The additional Intro class added yet another teacher to the computer science faculty,  Boris Granovskiy. It was the students in Granovskiy‚Äôs class who were allowed get a graduation credit for their Intro class to replace the drafting requirement. Students, however, began to complain that it was unfair for only one Intro class to satisfy the graduation requirement. ‚ÄúIf you were in my class you didn‚Äôt get credit because it was only for this one substitute,‚Äù Zamansky explained. After the complaints increased, the administration caved in and allowed all Intro classes to get credit.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Once a single semester of Introduction to Computer Science (MKS21) was officially a graduation requirement, Zamansky began to work on creating a second semester class for his intro program, MKS22. ‚ÄúThe whole idea behind Intro to Computer Science is that during MKS21, the first half, you learn to think like a computer scientist. But in MKS22, you‚Äôre gonna use real stuff. We do data analysis‚Ä¶and this is something that no matter what field you‚Äôre going to go into, they‚Äôre gonna help you,‚Äù he explained. Finally with the success of creating a whole year of Intro, Zamansky was able to achieve his goal of teaching computer science to the whole student body.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Although the wide array of computer science classes has grown into one of the most popular programs in Stuyvesant, it still faces several obstacles. The most prominent of these problems is that this program is not classified as a separate department because there is not a separate licensing for computer science teachers. Since the computer science programs are classified as math, it leads to several conflicts of interest, namely the daily functions of the program. This includes hiring and evaluating teachers and transferring students between classes. Furthermore, some of the computer science teachers are also math teachers, which causes problems when creating schedules each year. Assistant Principal of Mathematics Maryann Ferrara in particular has to deal with these problems; while hiring teachers, she has to find a fair way to allocate money for teachers between both the math department and the computer science program, according to Zamansky.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Even though Zamansky and his program have faced problems to this day, he continues to take pride in what he has done with it. During his interview, he joyfully recounted memories of his students and their achievements of working for companies like Electronic Arts, Google, and Facebook. Besides the individual student accomplishments, the program has grown beyond the walls of Stuyvesant to include an organization called Computer Science and Technology for Urban Youth, a computer science program at St. Joseph‚Äôs College that pioneered this summer. Taught by several of Stuyvesant‚Äôs computer science teachers including JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver and Samuel Konstatinovich, the goal of the program is the same as it was in the beginning: to expose more students to computer science and to give them a venue to develop their skills.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And so, from a single section of AP Computer Science taught by a single teacher in 1994, Stuyvesant‚Äôs computer science program has grown into a sophisticated program that is one of a kind. ‚ÄúWe had investors who wanted to invest in our student projects before they graduated. That doesn‚Äôt happen anywhere. We‚Äôve got this very special thing that is nowhere else in the country,‚Äù Zamansky said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs really nothing comparable to it.‚Äù
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Last night, I attended the Dream It, Code It, Win It awards.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;d actually write up the event but Fred Wilson&#39;s already done a
better job at that than I could:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://avc.com/2014/05/dream-it-and-code-it/&#34;&gt;http://avc.com/2014/05/dream-it-and-code-it/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
As Fred stated on his blog, it&#39;s a real shame that the high schooler&#39;s
didn&#39;t get to show off their work but it was great to see that there
were entries from a variety of schools including The Academy for
Software Engineering and The Young Women&#39;s Leadership Academy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As part of the application process, the teams made short videos. Here
are three of the Stuy entries. I&#39;ll add the fourth once I get it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The first two were written by teams in our senior SoftDev class the
third by juniors currently in APCS using mostly what they learned in
the second half of our intro class.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tapia 2014</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-02-09-tapia/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-02-09-tapia/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spent the past few days at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tapiaconference.org&#34;&gt;Tapia Conference&lt;/a&gt; in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tapia conference is billed as a &amp;ldquo;Celebration of Diversity in
Computing.&amp;rdquo; The bulk of the attendees seemed to be
students. Undergrads and grads. The undergrads were mostly juniors and
seniors, but a bunch of freshmen and sophomores were there as well. Of
course there were faculty members to join them as well as people from
industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was I doing there? Well, 20 high school teachers were given
scholarships to attend a workshop run by
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/garcia.html&#34;&gt;Dan Garcia&lt;/a&gt;. Dan
is the driving force behind one of the implementations of CS
Principals course - a new course being rolled out by the College
Board. As you&amp;rsquo;re all well aware, I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of the College Board
but I&amp;rsquo;m interested in Dan&amp;rsquo;s work as common friends speak well of
him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about his course next time, after I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through his
workshop. For now, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what to expect but let me tell you, I was blown
away. Many of the break out sessions didn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;speak&amp;rdquo; to me as a high
school teacher, but that&amp;rsquo;s fine - the conference was for the
youngsters. I can&amp;rsquo;t say for sure, but it seemed to me that they really
hit the breakout sessions on the head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there were the plenaries. Great speakers and a great range of topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cieko Asakawa talking about assistive technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dan Garcia on CS Education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latanya Sweeney - transparency and privacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James McLurkin - robotics (and some computational geometry)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kathryn McKinley - Systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marcus Mitchel - A general talk on hard problems, winding paths, and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An incredible rage of topics. All the speakers were terrific - they
all talked about their life and career paths and were all
inspirational&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also presented a smorgasbord of computer science possibilities
for the students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish this could be bottled up and given to all aspiring technologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only got to attend because I was on scholarship as a high school CS
teacher. It was an amazing few days and I can&amp;rsquo;t recommend the Tapia
conference highly enough for young computer scientists out there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I learned from Pete Seeger</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-01-30-pete-seeger/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-01-30-pete-seeger/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past Monday I, like may woke to hear about the passing of
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger&#34;&gt;Pete Seeger&lt;/a&gt;. Ten days
earlier we were up at Symphony Space for the &amp;ldquo;Woody&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;rdquo; 45th
Anniversary Concert. Pete was supposed to perform but was ill. At 94
years of age, I wondered if the end was near. I was at the concert
with my family as well as with my buddy Ben. Fitting since Ben and I
grew up on Pete&amp;rsquo;s music while many of our peers did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with Pete Seeger, his life and his work, I
really encourage you to check out the 2007 documentary &lt;a href=&#34;http://video.pbs.org/video/2365166823/&#34;&gt;The Power of
Song&lt;/a&gt;. He was truly a
remarkable man. One of the most influential singer, songwriter,
activists of our times yet remarkably humble and approachable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember seeing Pete when I was a schoolboy. He would have been in
his fifties at the time. Thirty years later, he was singing for my
son&amp;rsquo;s second grade class in the same public school in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete&amp;rsquo;s been eulogized by far better writers than I so let me just
share some of Pete&amp;rsquo;s influences on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that Pete said, highlighted in the PBS documentary - &amp;ldquo;Think
global, act local.&amp;rdquo; Peter attributed it to Rene Dubos. As a teacher
and someone trying to make a difference through education, I think
about this a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As teachers, we have to act locally. We work with our kids every day
and can make a difference in individual lives. While we&amp;rsquo;re doing this,
the global picture is a mess. Teachers are vilified, schools are
closed, and policy is set by people who have never been in the
classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is hope, however. Just like Pete and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River_Sloop_Clearwater&#34;&gt;Clearwater
movement&lt;/a&gt;
local action, spearheaded by the likes of Diane Ravitch seems to be
taking hold. We&amp;rsquo;re starting to see common core exposed and the types
of evaluation systems pushed by the Gates foundation debunked. Think
global, act local.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as you know, I&amp;rsquo;m a computer science educator and there are many
similarities between CS education and general education. Most of the
noise you hear is from non educators, or at least non K-12
educators with actual real experience and a real track record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These voices range from well informed, to well meaning, to
misdirected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year the CSTA held a twitter conversation with K12
CS Education thought leaders and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a k-12 teacher amongst
the listed participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code.org, a well meaning organization that has done a great job
exciting people abotu CS Ed has a quotes page. The closest thing to a
teacher there is Randi Weingarten and she was just in the classroom
for a cup of coffee. The only other person on the list with &amp;ldquo;teach&amp;rdquo; in
their title is Wendy Kopp who believes that poorly trained temps make
better teachers than experienced pros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how will the conversation turn? Will groups and individuals with
influence engage those of us on the ground with actual results, or
will will receive dictates from on high? Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, all I can do is continue to act local. I can&amp;rsquo;t say what
will happen in the greater CS education landscape but I know that
every day I will see 150 kids and 20 more every Saturday. My kids, who
will be part of the Stuy CS and now CSTUY family. They might not know
now what they&amp;rsquo;re getting, but I do and I know I&amp;rsquo;ve made a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Plans for the New Year</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-01-01-new-year/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-01-01-new-year/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never been one for New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;rsquo;m working on something specific, I might set a goal to finish it,
but the idea of goals for a year never struck a chord with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s one of the things that I find absurd about the current teacher
rating system - I have to decided on my three goals for the year. I
always have one goal with respect to my profession - to be better at
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, even though I don&amp;rsquo;t have specific overall goals for me,
there are some projects that I plan on pouring myself into this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year closed with a lot of national hype over CS Ed. What remains
to be seen is where we go with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to try to work within the system - try to convince the
new administration that supporting and replicating Stuy CS is something worth
doing but I&amp;rsquo;ve been burnt enough to know not to
put all my eggs in that basket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to put a lot of time into
&lt;a href=&#34;http//cstuy.org&#34;&gt;CSTUY&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;re just about a year old and it&amp;rsquo;s been a
slow road but we&amp;rsquo;re making some real progress - and this is just as a
grass roots organization - it&amp;rsquo;s just us and the StuyCS Alumni family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what are the plans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#####More Hacking Sessions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started Hacking Sessions in October. Twenty New York City public
high school students getting together to geek out and do CS every
Saturday. We&amp;rsquo;re off to a great start but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work to be
done. We&amp;rsquo;d love to get more students involved in the coming semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#####Start Summer Hackers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the big effort. A summer program. Since we designed and
implemented Google CAPE NYC back in 2010, I&amp;rsquo;ve known the effect you
can have with a strong summer program taught by master teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve got the teachers and the program, but it&amp;rsquo;s still going to take a
lot of work.We have yet to finalize on a location (we have a tentative
offer for space but I&amp;rsquo;m hesitant to say anything until it&amp;rsquo;s more
concrete) and we have to do it early enough so that we can get to the
students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can get CSTUY&amp;rsquo;s Summmer Hackers off the ground I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure
we can use that to launch a community of both hackers and teachers
just as we&amp;rsquo;ve done at Stuy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#####Get more people involved&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said that so far CSTUY has been grass roots only. In order for us to
succeed, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to grow our community. The hope and plan is to get
the NY Tech community behind our efforts. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that when they see
us taking our proven programs out from Stuy to the greater public
they&amp;rsquo;ll come out in droves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least that&amp;rsquo;s the hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, those are my goals for the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should be exiting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A New Year and a New look</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-12-30-new-year-new-look/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-12-30-new-year-new-look/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re practically at the close of 2013 and it&amp;rsquo;s high time I wished
everyone wonderful things for the year to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also time for a new look to this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why the rewrite? Partly because I was tired of the look, but mostly
because, when I put it together, it was the first time I used that
toolset and was just figuring things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still no expert, but I thought it was time to clean things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s still a &lt;a href=&#34;http://jekyllrb.com/&#34;&gt;jekyll&lt;/a&gt; generated blog hosted on
&lt;a href=&#34;http://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub pages&lt;/a&gt; but instead of using
&lt;a href=&#34;http://getbootstrap.com/&#34;&gt;Twitter Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; I decided to use
&lt;a href=&#34;http://weice.in/ivory/&#34;&gt;Ivory&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s much smaller and only does the
basics. Even the menu I&amp;rsquo;m using was the result of some online
searching for CSS stuff. I figure that this way, I&amp;rsquo;ll actually learn
more about styling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be an interesting year. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a number of projects that
I&amp;rsquo;m working on. Some within Stuyvesant, some revolving around &lt;a href=&#34;https://cstuy.org&#34;&gt;CSTUY&lt;/a&gt;, and some I can&amp;rsquo;t talk about right now. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll
be able to write about some of them in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also hoping to write more this year. I only posted 30 times this
past year. On the other hand, that&amp;rsquo;s up from 18 times in 2012 and only
4 posts in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to updates on CSTUY, pedagogical posts and the occasional
rant, I&amp;rsquo;d like to do a series on how I use tools like the Linux shell
and Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll see how things go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I wish you all a happy and healthy new year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Summer Project 1 - Citibike Data</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-07-14-summer_projects/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-07-14-summer_projects/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, the Citibike program has been running for a bit. I like the idea,
but I have some reservations &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s great for getting around in the
zone - I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for short shopping trips - run cross town to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fairwaymarket.com/&#34;&gt;Fairway&lt;/a&gt; or take a quick trip from
work to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.portorico.com/store/&#34;&gt;Porto Rico Importers&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&#34;http://pasticceriarocco.com/&#34;&gt;Rocco&amp;rsquo;s Pastries&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand,
the zone doesn&amp;rsquo;t get to the residential neighborhoods of upper
Manhattan or the boroughs and the price per day is way too expensive
for regular working class joes, particularly on top of a subway trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, I was curious about station use patterns. Cool thing is
that you can get live data from
&lt;a href=&#34;http://citibikenyc.com/stations/json&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This was a great
opportunity to play with some tools to see if I want to use them in
class next year. In particular, &lt;a href=&#34;http://backbonejs.org&#34;&gt;backbone.js&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;d3js.org&#34;&gt;d3.js&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;m grabbing the station data every 5 minutes, storing it in a
Mongo database, and threw together a little map and graph app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check it out &lt;a href=&#34;http://cb.zamansky.net&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is up on GitHub:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/zamansky/citibike-1&#34;&gt;citibike-1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might play around and add more graphs as I collect more data or
maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll just move on to the next project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Graduation</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-07-02-graduation/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-07-02-graduation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;


One week ago today was Stuyvesant&#39;s graduation.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I usually know a number of seniors pretty well but, since I like to
cycle through classes, every couple of years I have a group that I&#39;ve
been with from 10th grade to 12th.
&lt;p&gt;
This was one of those years
&lt;p&gt;
It was extra special because it was also my daughter Batya&#39;s graduating class.
&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s been an amazing gift to be able to work at her school for the past four years and she&#39;s been amazingly tolerant. Particularly with both her and her boyfriend in my class this year.
&lt;p&gt;

Actually, they&#39;re both terrific and I think I only embarrassed her a
couple of times.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Every few years, my seniors ask me if I want them to nominate me as
faculty speaker at graduation. Usually I say no - stage fright. This
year, Batya asked. I thought it would be really cool. I said yes and
the troops came through and voted me in. I wasn&#39;t sure I would be the
winner, but as Peter commented &#34;but you lead the most popular cult at
Stuy!&#34;

It would have been enough of an honor to speak to the graduating
class, including many students that I feel connected to and it would
have been a great honor to speak at Batya&#39;s graduation. To add to it
all, the guest keynote speaker was my dear childhood friend Ben Fried.
&lt;P&gt;
Truly a career highlight.
&lt;P&gt;
Ben was terrific. I was watching the audience as he spoke - he
delivered a great message and really kept the classes attention. No video as of yet, but Ben published the text on Google+.

&lt;P&gt;
You can find it
&lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/108690239590381459413/posts/addaYWp36R2&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Here&#39;s a video of my speech. Jennifer said some very nice things to
introduce me. I was tempted to go off script right at the beginning
and point out that many of the nice things she said were really about
our CS team and not just me:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/beFQc2U9Kls&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I really didn&#39;t read the speech, just used the printed text as notes,
but here&#39;s what I worked from:

&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/07-02-2013-graduation/gradspeech.pdf&#34;&gt;gradspeech.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The graduating class seemed to enjoy it, at least as much as
one can enjoy any graduation speech, but, for me, as I said, a
career highlight.
