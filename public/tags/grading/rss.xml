Just saw this:
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Evaluation
metric idea: take snapshots of students&amp;#39; grades each week
(specifically, the grade they actually see in your LMS). How well do
these correlate with your final assigned grade? Were students getting
good estimates?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Austin Cory Bart (@AustinCorgiBart) &lt;a

charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It made me think of a couple of conversations I had with more senior
teachers early in my career.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They&amp;#39;d tell me &amp;#34;by and large, you know what the kids are going to get
after a few week.&amp;#34; By and large they were right. Sure there were some
kids that would turn it on midway and raise end up earning a higher
grade and some who fell off a cliff but for the most part, you knew
pretty early. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you don&amp;#39;t need assessments along the way - both
to inform the student on how they&amp;#39;re doing and to inform both teacher
and student on how to best proceed in order to benefit the student. Of
course, sometimes, even when you present some students will their dire
situations they can remain in denial for a remarkable period of time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At Stuy, the standing grading policy was 2 full period exams each marking
period - this meant at least 6 a semester. Add to that a final which
usually counted as two tests and we had more than enough to drop the
lowest grade - a practice followed by many teachers. Depending on
subject you&amp;#39;d also add in papers, projects, quizes, Homework,
participation and anything else you&amp;#39;d like weighted in a variety of ways.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As an interesting aside, I was able to evaluate my senior classes at Stuy
entirely on projects - no tests but not my sophomore classes. Stuy
students were so conditioned on exams that they really needed them to
keep themselves honest. It took time to ween them off. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started at Seward Park High School and that school had a similar policy. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event, those teachers that told me that you&amp;#39;d know the final
grades early on were pretty spot on. A number of times I tried an
experiment - for final grades, I&amp;#39;d first write down what I thought the
grades would be and then I ran all the assessments through the
weighted average formula. The &amp;#34;guesses&amp;#34; were almost always pretty spot
on.  I also compared the final grades to the second marking period
grades. I chose the second because the first marking period grades
were just letters - E for excellent, S satisfactory, N needs
improvement, and U. There was some movement but it was more from my
grading up or down due to the amrking period rather than a real
change. I would grade down in the second marking period and up in the
third.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This isn&amp;#39;t to say that Cory&amp;#39;s suggestion doesn&amp;#39;t make sense and it
also doesn&amp;#39;t mean that I or other teachers are fabulous estimators -
for all I know, I was biasing some subjective students grades based on
some preconceived notion I wasn&amp;#39;t aware of making the final grade a
self fulfilling prophecy. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event, I was able to do this when I was teaching in high school
but not so far in college. Maybe it&amp;#39;s because I&amp;#39;ve only been at Hunter
for three years and I developed my high school chops over
decades. Maybe it&amp;#39;s because I have far less contact time with the
students - 2 days a week for an hour fifteen vs five days a week for
43 minutes a shot. It could be that there were more opportunities for
assessment in high school due to more contact time. I&amp;#39;m really not
sure. Something to ponder further.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unit Tests Grading Workflow</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/unit-tests-grading-workflow/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/unit-tests-grading-workflow/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve talked before about unit testing (&lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/testing-testing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/testing-part2&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). My premise is
that in addition to being an important industry technique, it&amp;#39;s a
sound practice for students studying CS. I also contend that it can
make grading easier on the teacher. Maybe not as easy as an
auto-grader but those have &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-10-16-graders.html/#.WtplHHXwZhE&#34;&gt;their own problems&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since I spent most of today grading I thought I&amp;#39;d share my current
workflow and how unit tests have made me more efficient.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have each student make a single GitHub repo for all individual
homeworks, labs and small projects. They&amp;#39;ll make additional repos for
larger and group projects. They fill out a Google form to give me the
repo link. I download the form and end up with a CSV file something like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-csv&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-csv&#34; data-lang=&#34;csv&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-csv&#34; data-lang=&#34;csv&#34;&gt;Doe, John, git@github.com:johndoe/mymoework.git
Doe, Jane, git@github.com:janedoe/labs.git
etc.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My goal is to clone each students repo into a directory and then
throughout the term, they add assignments to their own repos using the
names and specifications I give them. For example, after assigning
three assignments, I could pull everything from their repos and I
would have a directory structure something like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;example&#34;&gt;
hw
├── doe_jane
│   ├── hw_01
│   ├── hw_02
│   └── hw_03
│
└── doe_john
├── hw_01
└── hw_02
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To get there, I have to change the csv file to a small shell script:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-bash&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;git clone git@github.com:johndoe/mymoework.git doe_john
git clone git@github.com:janedoe/labs.git doe_jane
etc.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I usually do this in Emacs with a macro.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now I&amp;#39;m ready to go.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Whenever there&amp;#39;s a new assignment, I just have to update all the
repos. I go into the root hw directory and loop through all the
subdirectoryes:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-bash&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;cs /path/to/hw_root
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; i in &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;ls&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
cd /path/to/hw_root/$i
git pull
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At this point I could go into each repo but we can do better. Since I
have all of my students submit a Makefile with a default target to
build an executable named &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; and also a target named &lt;code&gt;tests&lt;/code&gt; which
will build an executable to run the unit tests named &lt;code&gt;tests&lt;/code&gt; I do this
instead of a straight pull:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-bash&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;cs /path/to/hw_root
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; i in &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;ls&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
cd /path/to/hw_root/$i
git pull
cd hw_03 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# or whatever assignment I&amp;#39;m grading&lt;/span&gt;
make tests
make
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, if I want, I can go into each directory, run the tests by typing
&lt;code&gt;./tests&lt;/code&gt;  and the hw or project with &lt;code&gt;./main&lt;/code&gt;. I can also add a
couple of lines to the for loop above like:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-bash&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;echo &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;$i&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt; Test Report\n----------------\n&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /path/to/hw_root/test_report
./tests &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /path/to/hw_root/test_rport
echo &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;----------------------\n\n&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This gives me a single file with everyone&amp;#39;s test results. Either by
doing this or by running the tests in each folder manually I can
quickly see what works and what doesn&amp;#39;t.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I&amp;#39;m doing this, I have Emacs up and with &lt;strong&gt;dired mode&lt;/strong&gt; and more
specifically &lt;strong&gt;ag-dired-regexp&lt;/strong&gt; which lets me easily
navigate to any student&amp;#39;s files. Combined with the test results I can
quickly evaluate the entire assignment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Put all of this together and it makes grading somewhat bearable. I can
work through well written, correct assignments extremely quickly and
drill down into the other projects efficiently as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
