      <title>Using Emacs 43 - Music with MPD</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I like to listen to music at work. Sometimes I just stream from
YouTube, Soundcloud, Spotify or some other online source but if you&amp;#39;re
a person of a certain age, like me, you probably have quite an mp3
collection. All those CDs that have been ripped not to mention some
converted vinyl.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I used to use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.musicpd.org/&#34;&gt;Music Player Daemon&lt;/a&gt; or MPD back in the day. It would
run in the background and you could connect to it using lots of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.musicpd.org/clients/&#34;&gt;clients&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I was running Ubuntu and Mint Linux, I had some trouble setting
up MPD but the process is much smoother using Manjaro which is Arch
based and I&amp;#39;m currently enjoying.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s a video on how I set up MPD and also use Emacs to control it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Coincidentally, on the same day I recorded this, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDEtZ7AKmwS0_GNJog01D2g/feed&#34;&gt;Uncle Dave&lt;/a&gt; put up a
similar &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTVN8UDScqk&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. Dave also sets up MPD on an Arch based linux but he
uses EMMS for his player. I ultimately end up with Simple-MPC with
briefs stops at the built in MPC mode and Mingus along the way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy.
&lt;/p&gt;
