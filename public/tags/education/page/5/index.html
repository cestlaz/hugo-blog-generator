        AP scores just came out. As usual, I see the posts and take part in conversations where teachers talk about their results. Some are happy about their results, some aren&#39;t, some don&#39;t really care.  I just want to make a plea to all AP teachers out there:  Don&#39;t let your value be dictated by the college board or any other exam.  I never really cared much about my students&#39; actual AP scores.

        Is it easier to take CS people and teach them to teach or is it easier to take teachers and teach them CS?  The question gets batted around from time to time.

        Back in February, I shared my thoughts on losing CS teachers to the tech industy. TL;DR - I don&#39;t think it will be a CS Ed problem.  That said, I do think that it will be hard to find good CS teachers but the reason is because it will get harder and harder to find good teachers in general.  There are plenty of reasons why it&#39;s harder to become a career teacher but I don&#39;t want to talk about those today.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        The hot debate this past week in NY Education circles is Mayoral Control. When I started teaching, New York City schools were controlled by the Board of Education. The board appointed a chancellor. The system was supposed to balance community control as well as some centralized decision making. The system was created in the late 60s and was entrenched through my schooling. By the time I was a teacher I think it was pretty much a given that the system didn&#39;t work.

        Tomorrow morning I fly out to Seattle for SIGCSE 2017. For those of you not in the CS Education space, SIGCSE is the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) special interest group for computer science education.  I&#39;ve wanted to go for years but have never been able. It&#39;s hard for a high school teacher to miss a week in mid March, particularly in places with a school calendar similar to New York.

        If we properly prepare CS teachers, won&#39;t they just jump ship and take tech industry jobs?   I hear that a lot.  Tech pays big. Teaching? Not so much. Tech workers are respected and have flexible jobs. Teaching? Again, not so much.  Those chanting these refrains advocate the current simple teacher &#34;training&#34; - scripted lessons, minimal pedagogical content knowledge, even less real content knowledge. That will keep them in the classroom.

        Scheme is one of the languages used in Stuy&#39;s intro CS course. Like any other language, there are pros and cons of using it to introduce students to CS. Here are some of the reasons why I like Scheme as a first language and why despite that, I don&#39;t recommend it in many cases.  Scheme certainly isn&#39;t mainstream. That&#39;s not the main reason why I like it but it is a side benefit.

        I was catching up with the team at Stuy the other day and they mentioned that they were periodically getting pushback on their choice of languages, particularly in the intro class. The pushback was mostly in the form of &#34;why don&#39;t you start them with Javascript?&#34;  Back in the day, when I created our intro class where we use Scheme, NetLogo and then later Python, I&#39;d get similar pushback but then it was &#34;why not Java?
