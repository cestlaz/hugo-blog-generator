        I&#39;m guessing my views on this aren&#39;t very popular -that&#39;s OK, every community needs a curmudgeon.  A few years ago, I cautioned if we weren&#39;t careful, once the big players got involved, CS Ed would go the way of other disciplines, and not in a good way. It looks like indeed we&#39;re well on our way down that road.  I&#39;ve ranted before about things like non-profits, drop in and summer programs.

        I didn&#39;t know Hunter College had computer science.   I heard that refrain more than once during my fall visits to high schools. Part of the reason for this is due to Hunter CS&#39;s low profile and small size in spite of its high quality.  Part, though, was also because of some misconceptions about Computer Science programs. I&#39;d hear things like &#34;but they only offer a BA not a BS,&#34; or &#34;but Hunter isn&#39;t an engineering school.

        The other day, a friend posited a question on Facebook (paraphrased):   If called upon, would you take a job in an administration who&#39;s policies you strongly disagreed with?   Would you go work for an administration that you reviled in order to get a seat at the table? To try to affect change from the inside or would you consider yourself a sellout or worse, publicly promote positions you disagree with.

        This old article has been reposted a few times in my circles over the past few weeks http://educationnext.org/facadeofexcellence/. It&#39;s from 2003 and complains about the lack of flexibility schools had back then with regard to hiring and salary. The article is old and out of date and the seniority system no longer holds for hiring but it does for lay offs. The salary scale from back then, though, is still in place.

        Over on Facebook, my Alma Mater and long time employer, Stuyvesant High School seems to be making a big push to up it&#39;s Regeneron Science Talent Search game. For those of you who aren&#39;t familiar, that&#39;s the latest incarnation of the Westinghouse Science Talent Search from back in my day.  It seems that Stuyvesant hasn&#39;t had that many semi finalists, finalists, and winners over the past few years and isn&#39;t happy about it.

        If you know me you know that my morning reads include a visit over to avc.com, Today, Fred&#39;s post talked about development and progress, evolution, if you would, in the city. Although not directly related, it got me thinking about gentrification.  To me, gentrification all too often seems to result in pushing out people and business that were there during the hard times.  We don&#39;t need to force out long time residents that can no longer make rent - we need to uplift communities with pathways to towards greater economic opportunity.

This morning, I read a viewpoint by Jeremy Scott and Alan Bundy on a program in Scotland. If you&#39;re an ACM member, and if you&#39;re a CS practitioner, student, academic, or teacher you should be, you can read the piece for details.

        Earlier today I read this post by Eliot Horowitz, founder and CTO of MongoDB.

Eliot, of course is discussing this as it applies to MongoDB and it&#39;s well worth a read but it got me thinking about the ever popular need to &#34;disrupt&#34; education.
