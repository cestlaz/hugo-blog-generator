      <title>Hunter College CS Teacher Certification - Final Project Fun Time</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-presentations/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2020 10:09:25 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Well, we just delivered the last formal piece of instruction for the
summer intensive. Writing this post between visits to breakout rooms
as the cohort works on their final projects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tomorrow and Thursday will be presentation time. Each group will give
spend thirty minutes teaching us all about some topic in CS along with
the plan for how we could teach the topic to our kids. We&amp;#39;ve got a few
more things to talk about as a group but it&amp;#39;s mostly time to sit back
and enjoy the show.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s been a long hard month for JonAlf Topher and me. A lot of work
goes in to a first time program and when you&amp;#39;re meeting every day all
day with off hours student support there&amp;#39;s not a lot of time for the
inevitable steering that comes with something new.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now though we can sit back and enjoy some presentations by some great
teachers and provide some meaningful feedback. We&amp;#39;ve got a nice list
of topics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Blockchain
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Genetic Algorithms
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Data Mining
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Machine Learning
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Natural Language Processing
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Public Key Encryption
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Data Visualization
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Classic AI - Decision Trees
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Classic AI - search
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Databases / SQL
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Obviously we&amp;#39;re not going to learn everything about topics like NLP or
ML but rather a single unit that can be done in a lass.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the end, the idea is that every cohort member will have a nice set
of topics and support materials from which to choose for their classes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Should be a lot of fun.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hunter&#39;s CS Teacher Certification program Week 2</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-week-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Jul 2020 10:31:53 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-week-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Time for some thoughts after week 2.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since this is the inaugural edition of our program and there was no
way to really know what the cohort would be like we&amp;#39;ve been adjusting
on the fly. This was expected but we&amp;#39;re finally starting to settle
in. We&amp;#39;re still finding more zoom heavy days but as we move towards
the end of our data structures segment there should be fewer of those.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The cohort is progressing nicely. They&amp;#39;re working hard - we&amp;#39;ve got
some members who are former CS majors or otherwise came in with a
strong CS background but many were relative beginners. They&amp;#39;re all
coming along. We have to remind them that some topics just take
time. I&amp;#39;ve taught these subjects for years at Stuy but also at Hunter
College and NYU and recursion just takes time. So do Linked Lists and
dynamic data structures. It&amp;#39;s typical for CS majors not to be really
comfortable with them for a couple of years. I think I was near the
end of my college days before I&amp;#39;d roll out a pointer based solution to
a problem with the same comfort as with an array. So, the long and
short is that they&amp;#39;re doing great.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When we started, we tried to integrate a discussion of pedagogy with
the CS but found that we were expecting too much as the CS was new to
a large portion of the group. We decided instead to model assorted
teaching techniques but keep the analysis and discussion mostly to the
CS. Last Friday though we spent most of the morning looking back at
the pedagogy. It was a rich discussion. We loved that many of the
teachers commented on &amp;#34;when we modeled&amp;#34; one technique or another. We
ended up spending a good amount of time talking about scaffolding and
code skeletons, code reading and tracing, live coding and a bunch of
others. What was also cool was that some of the techniques we modeled
didn&amp;#39;t come up in our discussion originally (we had to interject them)
and some things we did unintentionally were also highlighted by the
cohort. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was a fun and productive morning. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another thing that came out of the discussion was our use of
technology but I&amp;#39;m saving that for another post. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, I&amp;#39;m remembering that a month long summer intensive is, well,
intensive. It&amp;#39;s really draining. After Friday&amp;#39;s session was done and
JonAlf, Topher and I debriefed, I just crashed for the night and
pretty much took Saturday off save making one video that we&amp;#39;ll need on
Monday. It&amp;#39;s also hard on the students - 12 credits in one month. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That said, we&amp;#39;re chugging along and they&amp;#39;re doing great. More
confident than ever that we&amp;#39;re going to have a 21 new leaders in CS Ed
in NY come the program&amp;#39;s conclusion.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hunter&#39;s CS Teacher Certification program  Week 1</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-week-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 13:48:21 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-week-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Time for an update on our NY State Teacher Certification Program. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We kicked off on Monday. Twenty two students working with three
instructors from 9:00 - 3:00 every day. We&amp;#39;ve been using a combination
of synchronous with Zoom and async using Slack and GitHub
discussions. We&amp;#39;re using GitHub as our main platform.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Day 0 was very Zoom heavy but we&amp;#39;re trying to balance one big Zoom
session a day combined with other work so as to minimize fatigue. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Due to our time constraints we had some prework before we officially
started. We had to debrief on that at the start and then also had to
deliver new instruction and all that made for a rough first day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Things got better in day 1. We were able to do one zoom session in the
morning to set the stage on 2D arrays and were able to work more
independently with slack support in the afternoon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On Day 2 I finally got to teach as I had been running a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teaching-cs-in-all-the-grades/&#34;&gt;Computational
Thinking&lt;/a&gt; workshop during days 0 and 1. I led the morning session on
Conway&amp;#39;s Game of Life which led to a coding project in the afternoon. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today we flipped the script doing self directed work in the morning
and then got together to go over objects and classes in the afternoon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While there&amp;#39;s more to tweak I&amp;#39;m very happy with how things are
going. We have a great cohort. In addition to supporting each other in
class they&amp;#39;ve started to organize their own study groups and sessions
both off hours and during our independant work. I haven&amp;#39;t said
anything about this nor have I intruded as I think it&amp;#39;s healthy for
the cohort to have their own self directed space. I&amp;#39;m glad it&amp;#39;s
happening without me having to prod behind the scenes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I&amp;#39;m very happy with how it&amp;#39;s gone so far there are some areas of
concern. Since this is a new program with an unknown cohort we&amp;#39;re
figuring out a lot on the fly. We&amp;#39;re doing better on the format and
pacing of activities but I feel we can still do better. With this in
mind we&amp;#39;re all having an online discussion throughout the weekend
about how to adjust and by we I mean the entire cohort and all the
instructors. If you&amp;#39;ve got a cohort of 22 experienced teachers you&amp;#39;re
foolish not to exploit their expertise. I&amp;#39;m also a little concerned
about the methods component. We&amp;#39;re already integrating some things -
live coding and subgoal labeling for example but some of the methods I
wanted to cover just don&amp;#39;t fit well in a remote model and we also have
to be careful about not overloading the teachers while many are just
learning the CS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next week we&amp;#39;ll start getting into data structures. We&amp;#39;ve got four
more weeks but we&amp;#39;re well on our way.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Education is not a spectator sport</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/education-not-spec-sport/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2020 08:07:26 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/education-not-spec-sport/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
As many of you know, the CS Education programs I designed here at
Hunter were finally approved by NY State late last year. We&amp;#39;re
planning to get started this summer. I&amp;#39;ve received many questions
about the program and will write up the details here sooner or later
but one question I frequently get is &amp;#34;will it be offered online?&amp;#34; This
is also something I&amp;#39;ve been asked more than once internal to Hunter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some of these requests make sense - we&amp;#39;re in the heart of NYC so
someone out on Long Island or further afield upstate won&amp;#39;t be able to
take our courses in person. This is the advantage of online
education. You can partake, or probably more often, consume it from
anywhere. Leaving out completion rates, that makes things very
attractive. Online is also very popular with bean counters. With it
you can set up practically unlimited class sizes. Lots of potential
profits. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, is it better?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While there are certainly many things you can learn online, is it the
same? Some argue that if a professor is straight out lecturing you
might as well watch the video. Probably true but is a dynamic
professor lecturing online the same as in person?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is a recorded concert the same as attending live? What about a
Broadway show? Sporting event?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll listen to music at home, watch a ballgame or even a recording of
a live show but it isn&amp;#39;t the same. Even when presenter-audience
interaction and audience-audience interaction is at a minimum - say a
classical concert, the live experience is both different, superior,
and more memorable than the memorex.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, there&amp;#39;s certainly value added by augmenting classes with online
content but all too often it&amp;#39;s used for cost cutting or profit
making. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://dianeravitch.net/2019/07/18/oklahoma-legislator-questions-why-state-is-giving-millions-to-virtual-charter-school/&#34;&gt;Virtual&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://dianeravitch.net/2019/08/14/ohio-gets-another-virtual-charter-school/&#34;&gt;Cyber&lt;/a&gt; Charter schools for details.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the day education is not a spectator sport.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 It&amp;#39;s built on the relationship between student, teacher, and
classmates. You can get some of that online and online is great when
there are truly no other alternatives. If we can ever figure out
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/communicating-with_students/&#34;&gt;online engagement&lt;/a&gt;, then technology will be even better at augmenting
(not replacing) good, live instruction. I&amp;#39;m certainly going to look
into offering parts of my classes remotely specifically for people
outside of NY City but we&amp;#39;re a long way from remote education being
even close to as good as in person.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teacher Centric Teaching</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-centric-teaching/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2020 08:27:09 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-centric-teaching/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Every few years the experts give us some new magic bullet, some new
 &lt;del&gt;teaching fad&lt;/del&gt; research based pedagogical technique. Teachers are
 trained in it, forced to use it - frequently as a one size fits
 all. If we do, we&amp;#39;re good teachers, if we don&amp;#39;t we get the dreaded
 ineffective on our annual ratings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was reminded of this when reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/guzdial&#34;&gt;Mark Guzdial&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s recent blog post on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://computinged.wordpress.com/2020/01/13/computing-education-lessons-learned-from-the-2010s-what-i-got-wrong/&#34;&gt;things he got wrong&lt;/a&gt; in Computing Education. It&amp;#39;s a really great
post. Mark mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)&#34;&gt;constructivism&lt;/a&gt; and it made me think of a few
years ago when constructivism was all the rage. If you didn&amp;#39;t set your
class up for &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_learning&#34;&gt;discovery learning&lt;/a&gt; all the time you were clearly a bad
teacher. I&amp;#39;d sit on on CS PD sessions, listen to principals and
supervisors talk about what they wanted to see in classes and on and
on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you weren&amp;#39;t a constructivist educator you weren&amp;#39;t a good educator.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course a few years earlier it was something else.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back when I started it was cooperative learning and
cooperative learning isn&amp;#39;t just group work - you had to follow the
formula. Each student in a group had a role, there were specific
stages of work and everything had to be just so.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There were other fads along the way. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you were lucky and had a good supervisor you didn&amp;#39;t have to worry
about the fads, the research, the nonsense. You could focus on your
development as a teacher. They might work with you on questioning, for
instance - regardless of the flavor of the month, a teacher will ask
questions and facilitate discussion and they will surely insulate you
from whatever nonsense the bean counters want to see as long as you&amp;#39;re
doing right by your students. On the other hand, a bad supervisor
would mean stressful set up observations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even without Mark&amp;#39;s post, I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about this a lot since
we&amp;#39;re about to launch our CS Teacher Certification programs at
Hunter so I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about these fads from a teacher
preparation point of view. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many of these fads have some value - they&amp;#39;re tools in the toolbelt to
be used as needed. The problem is that supervisors, and in my
experience, professional development and teacher preparation programs
make teaching 100% about the student. While the student is in fact the
customer and who&amp;#39;s development is the goal of our work, you can&amp;#39;t
ignore other factors. Environment and resources are two of these other
factors and a big one is the teachers individual strengths,
weaknesses, and tendencies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cooperative Learning never really worked for me - at least not whole
hog. As a &amp;#34;Cooperative Learning teacher&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;d be meh at best. On the
other hand, I&amp;#39;ve taken plays from the cooperative learning playbook
and applied them as I&amp;#39;ve seen useful. Sometimes it didn&amp;#39;t work,
sometimes to great effect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a teacher, I always took the advice of one of my early fencing
mentors. I was receiving conflicting advice from multiple well
respected coaches and more experienced fencers. My mentor said &amp;#34;listen
to what they all have to say, think about it, figure out what best
will work for you and do that.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As to running my teacher prep programs, I&amp;#39;m going to do my best to
make sure that we do recognize that teachers bring different things to
the table and it will my job to help them maximize their
effectiveness. This means that we can&amp;#39;t blindly follow the favored
teaching techniques du jour but rather we have to look at all sorts of
methods and combine them with our teachers strengths, abilities, and
tendencies, and their specific classroom situations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It should be fun.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Proof By Authority</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/proof-by-authority/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 07:00:12 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/proof-by-authority/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
No,I&amp;#39;m not talking about&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority&#34;&gt;Argument from Authority&lt;/a&gt; - something that very
much plagues CS Education and education in general where an annointed
few who may, or may not really know what they&amp;#39;re talking about are
given creedence because they&amp;#39;ve been there the longest, work for the
companies with the biggest names, have the economic backing  or
otherwise have been given the stage. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m talking about Proof by Authority which I fondly remember from
those silly &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~fleck/proof.html&#34;&gt;Proof techniques&lt;/a&gt; lists that went around in the
day. Techniques like:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Technique&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Example&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Proof by Intimidation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Trivial&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Proof by example&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The author solves for n - 2…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Proof by funding&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How the Bill Gates Foundation be wrong&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and many many more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Proof by authority was basically &amp;#34;I saw Dr. Gershon in the elevator
and she said….&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What made me think og this was this Tweet by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/b0rk&#34;&gt;Julia Evans&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;i&amp;#39;m not
sure if this advice is too obvious/basic but I really like to approach
confusing debugging situations by first looking at where my
understanding of the system is fuzzy, not by immediately trying to
tackle the bug&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 🔎Julia Evans🔍 (@b0rk) &lt;a
href=&#34;https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1143313949640810498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;June
25, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async
src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34;
charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know Julia personally, but we have mutual friends and I&amp;#39;ve been following
her online for a while. She makes cool &amp;#34;zines&amp;#34; and interesting blog
posts about a variety of tech type topics leaning towards the systems
side. Her latest post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/06/23/a-few-debugging-resources/&#34;&gt;debugging&lt;/a&gt; is well worth a read.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What caught my eye was &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m not sure if this advice is too
obvious/basic…&amp;#34; It isn&amp;#39;t. As an educator I&amp;#39;ve found that to others,
what&amp;#39;s obvious to us is not always obvious or clear to others. What I
also got to thinking about was the fact that if a student follows Julia,
they&amp;#39;re, in many cases, more likely to listen to her rather than her
teacher because Julia&amp;#39;s a known and respected expert in the field and
a teacher is well, just a teacher. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This further reminded me of something that happened early on in my
career. I was a reasonably popular teacher but I didn&amp;#39;t have that much
of a reputation being fairly new. I would try to add real world  best practices to
my classes but I could tell that many of the students weren&amp;#39;t really
buying it. Mid semester, a friend came to town. He was a long time
Microsoft employee. He started right after college in the late 80&amp;#39;s
and had been there ever since. He gave a guest talk in my classes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the things I remember Danny saying in the class was that &amp;#34;Stuy
wasn&amp;#39;t special because of the teachers, but rather because of the
students.&amp;#34; He was right, but I, um &amp;#34;Thanks, Danny, you know, I&amp;#39;m a
teacher and right here in the room :-)&amp;#34; On the other hand, in later
talks he always did say to listen to what I had to say. I guess during
the first talk he didn&amp;#39;t really know what I brought to the table as a
teahcer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other thing is that Danny talked about a number of best practices
both in his talk and during Q&amp;amp;A. In all cases, what he said mirrored
what I had been telling my students all year and none of it was
planned.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not only did the kids pay more attention to what Danny had to say than
what I had previously tried to say but from that point on, they paid
more attention to my asides on what is done in the &amp;#34;real world.&amp;#34; I had
been authenticated by a top level Microsoft engineer. Proof by
Authority.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since those early days, I&amp;#39;ve developed my own reputation. My students
graduated and went on to success both in and outside of CS. They
both provided the information I needed to know how best to prepare my
students and also verified that I was doing it. Over time I needed
outside verification less and less but was able to get and rely on
outside information more and more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I saw Julia&amp;#39;s tweet it made me think that having respected
industry people share their thoughts on what works for them in clear
concise ways is not only valuable directly but can also be of value
indirectly when used wisely by teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Predicting Grades</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/predicting-grades/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Just saw this:
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Evaluation
metric idea: take snapshots of students&amp;#39; grades each week
(specifically, the grade they actually see in your LMS). How well do
these correlate with your final assigned grade? Were students getting
good estimates?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Austin Cory Bart (@AustinCorgiBart) &lt;a
href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AustinCorgiBart/status/1129743671639838720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;May

src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34;
charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It made me think of a couple of conversations I had with more senior
teachers early in my career.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They&amp;#39;d tell me &amp;#34;by and large, you know what the kids are going to get
after a few week.&amp;#34; By and large they were right. Sure there were some
kids that would turn it on midway and raise end up earning a higher
grade and some who fell off a cliff but for the most part, you knew
pretty early. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you don&amp;#39;t need assessments along the way - both
to inform the student on how they&amp;#39;re doing and to inform both teacher
and student on how to best proceed in order to benefit the student. Of
course, sometimes, even when you present some students will their dire
situations they can remain in denial for a remarkable period of time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At Stuy, the standing grading policy was 2 full period exams each marking
period - this meant at least 6 a semester. Add to that a final which
usually counted as two tests and we had more than enough to drop the
lowest grade - a practice followed by many teachers. Depending on
subject you&amp;#39;d also add in papers, projects, quizes, Homework,
participation and anything else you&amp;#39;d like weighted in a variety of ways.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As an interesting aside, I was able to evaluate my senior classes at Stuy
entirely on projects - no tests but not my sophomore classes. Stuy
students were so conditioned on exams that they really needed them to
keep themselves honest. It took time to ween them off. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started at Seward Park High School and that school had a similar policy. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event, those teachers that told me that you&amp;#39;d know the final
grades early on were pretty spot on. A number of times I tried an
experiment - for final grades, I&amp;#39;d first write down what I thought the
grades would be and then I ran all the assessments through the
weighted average formula. The &amp;#34;guesses&amp;#34; were almost always pretty spot
on.  I also compared the final grades to the second marking period
grades. I chose the second because the first marking period grades
were just letters - E for excellent, S satisfactory, N needs
improvement, and U. There was some movement but it was more from my
grading up or down due to the amrking period rather than a real
change. I would grade down in the second marking period and up in the
third.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This isn&amp;#39;t to say that Cory&amp;#39;s suggestion doesn&amp;#39;t make sense and it
also doesn&amp;#39;t mean that I or other teachers are fabulous estimators -
for all I know, I was biasing some subjective students grades based on
some preconceived notion I wasn&amp;#39;t aware of making the final grade a
self fulfilling prophecy. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event, I was able to do this when I was teaching in high school
but not so far in college. Maybe it&amp;#39;s because I&amp;#39;ve only been at Hunter
for three years and I developed my high school chops over
decades. Maybe it&amp;#39;s because I have far less contact time with the
students - 2 days a week for an hour fifteen vs five days a week for
43 minutes a shot. It could be that there were more opportunities for
assessment in high school due to more contact time. I&amp;#39;m really not
sure. Something to ponder further.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Hunter Daedalus Fall 2019 recruiting class</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/daedalus-class-2019/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2019 08:25:12 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/daedalus-class-2019/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Now that high school seniors have all committed to their respective
colleges I though I&amp;#39;d share some information on Hunter&amp;#39;s incoming
Daedalus (honors CS) cohort.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I joke about the first cohort saying that nobody applied to the
program. That&amp;#39;s kind of true. I jointed Hunter a little over three
years ago in late January. That was after high school seniors had
already applied to college and at that time the program didn&amp;#39;t
exist. We found the first cohort by looking at students who had
already applied to Hunter not expecting Daedalus to exist.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was 12 kids and we&amp;#39;ve lost a few since then. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The second cohort consisted of 24 students. We started adding
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_E._Macaulay_Honors_College&#34;&gt;Macaulay&lt;/a&gt; students into the mix. Macaulay is a CUNY wide honors
scholarship program. Each campus has a cohort and it was part of an
effort to bring CUNY back to it&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;glory days&amp;#34; before open
enrollment. The Macaulay kids saw that Daedalus was the place to be
for CS in NYC and Hunter and wanted in. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Third year, we were up to 44 students. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, in our fourth year we&amp;#39;re up to 50 which is a little over
capacity - at least until I can find and hire a partner in crime  (and
I am looking).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some other stats:

&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also have stats on grades and test scores as well as the number of
offers an the percent of acceptances. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some thoughts on the stats:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I try to spend as much time as I can doing outreach. This is horribly
inefficient but it&amp;#39;s slowly getting the word out. I might spend most
of a day trekking out into the boroughs to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/fall-2018-tour-revisited/&#34;&gt;talk to a class&lt;/a&gt; or a few
classes at some school knowing that there will probably be very few
fits for my program. I think I&amp;#39;m bringing important information to all
of the kids but it&amp;#39;s a low yield activity. Right now our biggest
feeder schools are Stuyvesant, Brooklyn Tech, and Bronx Science. Next
is Midwood. This makes sense as they&amp;#39;re all &lt;strong&gt;large&lt;/strong&gt; schools and they
all have established CS classes. They&amp;#39;ll probably continue to be the
biggest feeders but I&amp;#39;m delighted by the fact that I&amp;#39;m getting
students from 17 other schools including a couple from outside of
NYC. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m less happy with the gender distribution. Twenty five percent isn&amp;#39;t
bad compared to the national numbers but we should be doing
better. It&amp;#39;s a tough nut to crack. When I visit to schools I&amp;#39;m
normally sent to the CS classes so I&amp;#39;m already getting a gender skewed
audience. Not sure the best approach to work on this. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, I&amp;#39;m getting to enough of a general audience to have
roughly a 50/50 split of students with APCS-A or beyond or what I
would call a beginner. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I get to know this new group and find out why they applied to
Hunter Daedalus and ultimately decided to attend I&amp;#39;m hoping to be able
to better fine tune my recruiting approach and outreach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a bottom line I&amp;#39;m going to continue to work to make Hunter&amp;#39;s
Daedalus program the place to be for CS education in NY so that kids
can get a top flight experience without paying a quarter of a million
dollars.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SIGCSE 2019 - the keynotes</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/sigcse-2019-keynotes/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2019 15:25:59 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/sigcse-2019-keynotes/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s that time of the year to write a series of blog posts about
SIGCSE. I thought I&amp;#39;d start with one on the keynotes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There were four keynote speakers. Marie desJardins, Gloria Townsend,
Mark Guzdial, and Blair Taylor. I wasn&amp;#39;t at the first timer&amp;#39;s lunch
where Townsend spoke so I won&amp;#39;t talk at all about that keynote.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m also not going to summarize the talks. Andy Ko wrote up a terrific
summary of his &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/sigcse-2019-trip-report-celebrating-50-years-b3460835a09a&#34;&gt;SIGCSE experience&lt;/a&gt; and did a much better job giving
overviews to the keynotes than I ever could so I&amp;#39;ll just refer you to
Andy&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/sigcse-2019-trip-report-celebrating-50-years-b3460835a09a&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, I&amp;#39;m just going to talk a bit about what they
left me thinking about. It might be something that&amp;#39;s pretty tangential
to the actual talk but hey, it&amp;#39;s the direction that the speaker sent
my brain to follow.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Marie des Jardin - the pinch hitter
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marie desJardins wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to be the keynote. She was filling in
for a flu ridden &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_A._Hrabowski_III&#34;&gt;Freeman Hrabowski&lt;/a&gt; at the last minute and she did a
more than admirable job.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The big line for me was her plea for us not to create &amp;#34;weed out&amp;#34;
courses but rather to create &amp;#34;launch&amp;#34; courses. I think this resonated
with many in the audience. It got me thinking about something that&amp;#39;s
been a concern of mine for a while. We see a lot of examples of making
student&amp;#39;s first CS experience more gentle and more varied. Probably
the biggest example is APCS-P but you can also find it in many college
CS0 classes. Hunter&amp;#39;s no exception - we&amp;#39;re now in the second year of a
more varied CS0 class (although truth be told, our problem
wasn&amp;#39;t so much that our old CS0 was a gatekeeper but more that
students hardly did any programming). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started to become aware of the problem as I would hear stories of
kids who did Girls Who Code programs who then dropped out of CS
classes that were too hard and then later when my former students at
Harvard told me that many kids &amp;#34;dropped like flies&amp;#34; in the class after
CS50. I&amp;#39;ve also seen these problems at Hunter but at least here I know
we&amp;#39;re working on it. Having a more accessible entry point is terrific
but not if you just set the kids up to fail one step down the line. It
seems that not enough people are looking at the complete path: from
first course to last and the transitions in between. This is a hidden
danger. We can proudly say that diversity and enrollments are up based
on those first experiences and no one&amp;#39;s the wiser that we&amp;#39;re killing
the kids later on. We have to do better.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Mark Guzdial - the outstanding contributer
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mark was this year&amp;#39;s winner of SIGCSE&amp;#39;s Award for Outstanding
Contribution to CS Education. A well deserved award. Mark&amp;#39;s talk was
terrific and similar to the one he gave at the Code and Beyond
conference in NY which I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/thoughts-on-code-and-beyond-ct/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As with the previous keynote you can get a great summary if you read
Andy&amp;#39;s post linked above.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One point Mark made was that he felt that all students should learn
programming but if I remember the talk correctly he didn&amp;#39;t make a
strong statement about all students learning CS. He also said that
first course our CS majors take shouldn&amp;#39;t be the same as the first
course for non majors. I see where Mark&amp;#39;s coming from I&amp;#39;m not sure I
agree. Well, I do agree given what a first CS course for a major
typically looks like versus what a never-CS major might need for life but
the few CS0 for non major courses I&amp;#39;ve seen don&amp;#39;t leave their students
with enough to continue on to the CS major or a minor (which could be
valuable to a HUGE swath of students) so they end up taking the CS0
for CS majors anyway. This means one more course and one more
semester. More cost and more time spent. I&amp;#39;ll say that I do agree with
Mark UNLESS you can design a course that can address the needs of both
parties and the truth is I think you can. We did it at Stuy. Students
come back with that having been their only course and talk of its
usefulness and utility and students come back having used it to launch
a tech career in later high school, college, and beyond. What we built
isn&amp;#39;t perfect and is for a particular population but as proof of
concept it&amp;#39;s convinced me that a single course for both can be done
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another one of Mark&amp;#39;s big points was taking CS into other subject
areas. I love this and I love when he said (apologies if the quote&amp;#39;s a
little off) &amp;#34;They need things and we can build stuff&amp;#34; as a call to
action to partner with and to develop the languages and tools needed
to support a new vision of CS embedded in other subject areas.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My thoughts here are that as a community we are ignoring the realities
of K12 education. Mark mentioned Bootstrap World, a sprogram both he
and I like very much. It is embedded in Algebra classes and uses CS in
Racket (nee Scheme) to support learning said algebra. Mark noted that
Racket looks like Algebra and that&amp;#39;s one of the reasons Bootstrap
works. Another fact often left out is that algebra is frequently
taught either over two years or with a double period allocated to
it. It is given more time than most classes and that allows teachers to experiment
a bit more with instruction. Even if we develop more tools like
Bootstrap that align themselves to teaching other subjects those
subject teachers might not have the time to dedicate to the new
tool. Why not? That&amp;#39;s another thing Mark indirectly mentioned. At one
point he said that we might have to &amp;#34;take a step back&amp;#34; first in terms
of results and quite frankly, K12 teachers sometimes can&amp;#39;t take that
chance. In addition to not wanting to give their current students a
worse experience even with the promise that future classes would get a
better one they have to face the specter of high stakes testing. If
I&amp;#39;m using a new CS tool in a history class and my student&amp;#39;s test
results go down, they might have to repeat the class and the teacher
could put their license in jeopardy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the end I loved just about everything Mark had to say but it still
got me thinking about a lot and to me that&amp;#39;s one of the hallmarks of a
great talk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
Blair Taylor - the controversy
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Blair Taylor gave the final keynote and this one had some controversy
around it. Andy&amp;#39;s blog post again summarizes things well. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My only take on the content is that the talk was more about
Dr. Taylor&amp;#39;s journey and less about Cyber Security (I hate it that
it&amp;#39;s now just being called &amp;#34;cyber&amp;#34;) but that was fine. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What I want to talk about here is not so much the controversy over how
some people took parts of Dr. Taylor&amp;#39;s talk and the Q&amp;amp;A at the end but
rather the fact that more and more recently I&amp;#39;ve felt that as a
community we can&amp;#39;t talk about difficult issues concerning gender,
race, and the like. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I consider myself an ally to under represented and under served groups
but have found myself in situations recently where unless I 100%
parrot one side&amp;#39;s extreme view I&amp;#39;m accused of sexism or racism at
which point ANYTHING I say is treated as such. One is not allowed to
see any nuance in what is a very complex topic. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At one point, the speaker made a joke. She prefaced it with something
like &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m going to tell this offensive joke&amp;#34; and that she could,
presumably because she is a women. The joke fell flat (although I&amp;#39;ve
told the story of the keynote to a few women in tech and they chuckled
and said they actually kind of liked the joke). My take was that the
speaker was setting the stage to maybe dive into a difficult
conversation. My take was also that some members of the audience right
then and there decided that the speaker was wrong about all things. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After the talk I was a bit more convinced that this was the case as I
read a tweet stream explaining what happened that included the joke
but none of the context for the reader to make an informed decision. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the end, I felt that Dr. Taylor has honestly worked for under
represented groups and while this might be unpopular, her pragmatism of
sometimes swallowing an insult and &amp;#34;having a sense of humor&amp;#34; is the
right thing to do. Unfortunately, Dr. Taylor misread the audience and that
some people decided somewhere in her talk that even though she was
working to empower women in her own way, it wasn&amp;#39;t &amp;#34;my way&amp;#34; so it was
wrong. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The situation was unfortunate and my big fear is that as a community
we still have a long way to go before we can have these conversations
and personally, as someone who considers themselves an ally of the
undeserved I&amp;#39;m becoming more gun shy of partaking in discussions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
That&amp;#39;s all for now.
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, that&amp;#39;s my take on the keynotes. Much more to come on the
conference in future posts. 
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thoughts On Code And Beyond - Computational Thinking</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/thoughts-on-code-and-beyond-ct/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2019 17:48:27 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/thoughts-on-code-and-beyond-ct/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The theme of this year&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/i/moments/1084877641285541889&#34;&gt;To Code and Beyond&lt;/a&gt; was Computational
Thinking. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/guzdial&#34;&gt;Mark Guzdial&lt;/a&gt; gave the keynote. While the talk isn&amp;#39;t
currently online, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3uCb-95fFE&amp;amp;t=5s&#34;&gt;this talk&lt;/a&gt; that Mark gave last March. It&amp;#39;s
not the same but the second halves are and well worth a look.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the first half, Mark talked about other types of &amp;#34;thinking.&amp;#34;
Scientific thinking, engineering thinking and even historical
thinking. All had a good amount of overlap with both each other and
with computational thinking even as we haven&amp;#39;t yet settled on what
computational thinking actually is.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This overlap is why I think that bringing CS into the primary grades
gives us an opportunity to reduce the achievement gap between rich and
poor. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve already said that I&amp;#39;m not sold on hardcore CS and programming in
the early grades but rather it&amp;#39;s CT - the problem solving and
methodologies of CS that can effectively be part of the earlier
grades.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, that&amp;#39;s easier said than done. While there has been some
pushback recently we still have far too much emphasis on standardized
tests and elementary school teachers are way overworked. Trying to get
already overburdened teachers to add in a whole new subject area is a
big ask. The opportunity is that we might be able to develop aspects
of CT in a way that supports what elementary teachers are already
doing, possibly under the unlabeled guise of scientific thinking,
historical thinking, engineering thinking or some other thinking.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is already going on to a certain extent with individual teachers
at individual schools. Logic games and problem solving techniques have
always been explored by elementary school teachers who have freedom
from tightly packed test based curricula. These could be considered CT
and you could also add data collection and processing and I&amp;#39;m sure
many other things as well. This is where CS/CT can fit in the
elementary schools without adding to the teacher&amp;#39;s current
load. What&amp;#39;s more, if we can figure out how to incorporate these CT
concepts to support the subject matter already being studied we could
help close the gap between the haves and the have nots.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve said many times before that I&amp;#39;m not an elementary school
specialist but I still suspect this is the approach for CS in the
primary grades at least for the near term. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve already got a pretty full plate between my work with Hunters
Daedalus CS honors program along with our pre-service programs being
very close to going live but I&amp;#39;m also hoping to do some work in
relating to this in the near future.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is There a First Grade Machine Learning Achievement Gap?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/is-there-a-first-grade-ml-achievement-gap/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Jan 2019 15:24:16 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/is-there-a-first-grade-ml-achievement-gap/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Today was the fifth &amp;#34;To Code and Beyond&amp;#34; - a one day conference
hosted at Cornell Technion and once again Diane Levitt put together
a great show. The theme was Computational Thinking and the day
consisted of a variety of talks, panels, and activities. I plan on
writing about one panel in particular but for today I wanted to
address something that came up as a question. One attendee asked a
panel about the achievement gap - the fact that when the CS movement got
started in NY some of the more innovative and interesting work was
being done with some of our most vulnerable students. Recently, he
heard about a student who was doing Machine Learning in early
elementary school - first grade. The concern
he had was that when we started the less affluent populations might
have even been pulling ahead but now he&amp;#39;s concerned that the gap
between have and have nots will continue to grow even in this new
field.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not so concerned about the ML gap in the early grades and I
still think that we still have an opportunity to lessen the gap
between the haves and have nots with CS and more specifically CT.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was reminded about when I started fencing. I first picked up a foil
in 11th grade. Stuy had a senior heavy team that year. I was the only
new junior and there were a bunch of new sophomores. The following
year, we were the starting lineup. We were raw but we still managed
second place in the city. Most of us continued on to fence in USFA
events and then in college. I remember one of the first events we went
to. It was the under 20 qualifiers for the Junior Olympics National
Championships. There were a couple of superstars who recently came
over from eastern bloc countries there. Also a bunch of
fencers we didn&amp;#39;t know but we knew that they&amp;#39;d been fencing for
years - since they were 8, 9, 10. &amp;#34;They&amp;#39;ve been fencing for
years. We&amp;#39;ve only been doing it for one. How can we ever compete?&amp;#34;
I remember Jordan saying &amp;#34;Yeah, they&amp;#39;ve fenced for years but probably
a day or two a week, we&amp;#39;ve been doing it intensely every day for a
year and a half.&amp;#34; He also noted that when they were in their early
years their bodies probably weren&amp;#39;t coordinated enough to really
develop so much. He was right. The superstars dominated but then we
were very much in the mix and in fact took most of the qualifying
spots. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also thought about teaching CS at Stuy. There were always kid who
came in to class with prior experience. That was clear on day one and
for the first few weeks. By the end of the first semester you woudn&amp;#39;t
know it based on overall class performance. The newcomers caught up
pretty quickly. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is why I&amp;#39; not really concerned when I hear about a school doing
Machine Learning in first grade. How much can they really do and how
deep is it? Is the kid even really ready for it or are they just going
through the motions? Or, are they just doing something they&amp;#39;ve always
done in first grade and are just labelling it ML.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think that last option is fairly likely. It&amp;#39;s also why I think we
still have an opportunity to close the achievement gap as part of the
CS / CT movement. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When people ask me about CS in the early grades I first tell them that
I&amp;#39;m not an early grade specialist. I follow this by stating that I
think that well resourced schools have been doing thing that we now
consider CT for years - logic, problem solving, puzzles, etc.When a
group of students solve a problem and describe a solution that
includes repetition it used to be just problem solving. Now it&amp;#39;s
computation thinking. Sure, we can tease it out, formalize it and
expand on it but the schools and teachers with the resources and
freedom have already been doing this. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With the CS For All movement, we have an opportunity to bring this to
all our students not just the well to do ones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course this is easier said than done. We have to prepare them to
identify these CT practices and actively develop these skills in their
students. This means giving teachers the time, resources, and training
and not shorten the already tight tether to standardized multiple
choice tests. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At times I&amp;#39;ve been disappointed with the overall K12 CS Ed
movement. We&amp;#39;ve made great strides coming from nowhere to where we are
but as a community we missed the opportunity to bypass the mistakes
and bad ideas that teachers of other disciplines are plagued with. 
We still have this chance with Computational Thinking and the early
grades.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I hope we do it right.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Happy New Year 2019</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/new-year-2019/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 09:55:01 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/new-year-2019/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve never been much of a New Years person. I get up really early and
so don&amp;#39;t usually stay up late and more to the point, as any teacher
knows, the year really goes from September through June with that
really long much needed  weekend that you regular folks call July and
August tacked on to separate years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This whole January first thing is really more  of a half time break or
perhaps an intermission.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regardless, I did start the calendar year productively - it was
warm enough for a run and on my way back got my first &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.citibikenyc.com/bikeangels/&#34;&gt;Bike Angel&lt;/a&gt; point
of the month and year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since I see January 1 as more of a mid year point than a start, I&amp;#39;m
not going to reflect back on what was or project what will be but I do
have a few projects that I want to make some headway on before classes
resum in a few weeks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First and foremost, I&amp;#39;m teaching Data Structures for the first time at
Hunter. Sure, I&amp;#39;ve taught it dozens of times but this will be
different. I haven&amp;#39;t done it in C++ since 2003 and teaching it in
college twice a week Mon/Thu for about 1:15 is not the same as high
school where we meet every day for 0:43. I&amp;#39;ve already been boning up
on my C++. Templates are much more of a pain than I remember them and
I still much prefer toString to operator overloading. I think once
I&amp;#39;ve written some more code and am back up to speed I&amp;#39;ll have a lot of
fun with the class.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other big project is that I want to make some progress on an
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/time-to-create-an-ethics-course/&#34;&gt;Ethics course&lt;/a&gt; that I want to have as part of my soon to be approved (I
hope) pre-service programs. I also want to make it available to
undergrads. I&amp;#39;ve been collecting thoughts and ideas for a couple of
months now and while I still believe that ethics is too important to
just be contained within a course - it must be woven through all our
courses, I do think I&amp;#39;ve got an overall plan that will result in a
very solid course.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are a couple of other projects I&amp;#39;m working on that I Can&amp;#39;t talk
about right now but I have no doubt I&amp;#39;ll be keeping myself busy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So to all the teachers out there, Happy Half Time and to everyone
else, Happy New Year.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sloan awards for excellence in teaching science and mathematics</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/sloan-awards-2018/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2018 12:52:44 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/sloan-awards-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I spent yesterday evening at the Cooper Union in their &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Union#The_Foundation_Building&amp;#39;s_Great_Hall&#34;&gt;Great
Hall&lt;/a&gt;, a place famous for Abraham Lincoln&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Union_speech#External_links&#34;&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; that some say
propelled him to the presidency.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was there in the audience watching as the Sloan Foundation and the
Fund for the City of New York awarded seven public school teachers
with an ward for &amp;#34;Excellence in the Teaching of Science and
Mathematics.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was their to see my friend Dave Deutsch, a long time public school
physics teacher receive the honor. Here&amp;#39;s a brief clip about Dave:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;iframe src=&amp;#34;&lt;a href=&#34;https://player.vimeo.com/video/304871223&#34;&gt;https://player.vimeo.com/video/304871223&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;640&amp;#34;
height=&amp;#34;360&amp;#34; frameborder=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can read Dave&amp;#39;s blurb as well as blurbs and videos for all of the
recipients &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fcny.org/fcny/core/sae/2018_winners/#david-deutsch&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve never taught with Dave but I&amp;#39;ve known him for a couple of decades
and he&amp;#39;s a teacher&amp;#39;s teacher. He and Devorah cut their teeth teaching
together at the Manhattan Center for Science and Math. Dave&amp;#39;s still
there. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dave&amp;#39;s also not the guy that normally gets awards. It&amp;#39;s not because he
doesn&amp;#39;t deserve them - he&amp;#39;s probably the best physics / science
teacher I know. It&amp;#39;s that he never toots his own horn, he&amp;#39;s not the
over the top super charismatic popular teacher who seems great in the
moment but in the long run might not be, and he never looks for the
spotlight. He just goes about his business of connecting, inspiring,
and truly caring about his kids. His value as an educator can be seen
not only in the short term in his classes but in the long run through
his former students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He&amp;#39;s the best.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over the years I tried to pull Dave over to Stuy or involve him in
other projects but he&amp;#39;s always stayed true to Manhattan Center and
it&amp;#39;s population even with the school&amp;#39;s toxic administration (it&amp;#39;s
worth noting that Dave&amp;#39;s video is the only one that didn&amp;#39;t include the
school&amp;#39;s principal lauding the recipient and was the only principal
not present at the festivities).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event, Dave&amp;#39;s a true champion for the public school students of
NYC and a true hero. There are a small handful of teachers that I
really look up to and Dave Deutsch is one of them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s to Dave and other teachers who never get the recognition they
deserve because they&amp;#39;re too busy doing the good work rather than self
promoting.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Email Policy</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/email-policy/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 19:36:37 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/email-policy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I saw this tweet the day along with the ensuing thread:
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Seriously, who emails a professor with words like &amp;quot;u&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;plz hlp&amp;quot;? Am I allowed to put language in my syllabus that penalizes students for obnoxious, intentional misspellings? Maybe: -1% to your course grade multiplied by the edit distance of the word with its correction?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Austin Cory Bart (@AustinCorgiBart) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AustinCorgiBart/status/1068386945854779392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;November 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34;
charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I wanted to reply but as usual, I decided to reply in a blog post so
that it doesn&amp;#39;t get lost in the Twitterverse. This way I can go back
and read this post in five years and say &amp;#34;what was I thinking!!!!&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve never gotten an email like the one Austin described. The closest
was back in the early days of email when kids had email addresses like
 &lt;strong&gt;koolwarezduud@hotmailcom&lt;/strong&gt;. That didn&amp;#39;t last long. Just ask what
they would think if they were a college admissions person or an
interviewer for a job and recieved an email from &lt;strong&gt;koolwarezdude&lt;/strong&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That said, even though I haven&amp;#39;t gotten emails with &amp;#34;u&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;plz hlp&amp;#34; I
do have to train my students to use email correctly so there might be
some parallels between my case and experiences and Austin&amp;#39;s.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For years I&amp;#39;ve used a mailing list for class communication. I&amp;#39;ve tried
alternatives like Slack and Piazza but always come back to an old
school mailing list. For years I used &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.list.org/&#34;&gt;Mailman&lt;/a&gt; but most recently I&amp;#39;ve
been using Google Groups. I always give my students the rules at the
beginning of the class:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The list can be used for anything related to class or CS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Things that are interesting to the community but not class or CS
related are also OK. Things like if a student is on a team that has
a big competition coming up or that there are free or cheap tickets
to a show or museum are also ok.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The usual rules for civility and respect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s all pretty low key, informal and open.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The big thing I tell them is that the &lt;strong&gt;only things&lt;/strong&gt; they should email
me directly about are things that are specific to the sender and
me. Things like grade related questions, a request for a
recommendation letter etc.. If it&amp;#39;s a question about the class
material, the tools, etc. I expect the email to go to the list not
me. I give three reasons for this
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Other class members could benefit from the question and answers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you email me only I can answer the question and only when I get
  to it. If you email the list, there are many more people who can
  potentially answer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If it&amp;#39;s a tools question, particularly Mac related It&amp;#39;s unlikely
I&amp;#39;ll know the answer but almost certainly someone in the class
will,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tell my classes that if they email me directly with something that
should go to the mailing list, I&amp;#39;ll ignore the email.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Predictably, at first students email me directly. The first couple of
times, I&amp;#39;ll answer the question by emailing the full list. I&amp;#39;ll say
something like &amp;#34;someone emailed me &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#34; give the answer  and also
remind them that emails like that should go to the list.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This usually clears things up for most of the students but some will
continue to email me. My next step is to reply to their email telling
them to repost to the group. If they do, I&amp;#39;ll answer (usually giving a
bit of time to hope that a classmate chimes in first). If they don&amp;#39;t
then the question won&amp;#39;t get a response.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Any emails that come directly to me after phase 2 go into the trash.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll also sometimes redirect questions I get after class to the
mailing list. Particularly if I think that the answer can benefit more
than the asking student or if the answer should remain accessible for a
longer period of time. This came up just the other day when a student
had an issue with their editor saving source files in RTF. I didn&amp;#39;t
have the answer and I also thought that the answer to this would be a
good thing for more students to see and also for the answer to be
searchable should it come up later. The student posted to the list and
another one of the students answered. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All in all I think this works pretty well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now if only I could get more actual student engagement online…
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PD in NYC</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pd-in-nyc/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Nov 2018 19:43:36 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pd-in-nyc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I spent this past Saturday morning up at the Microsoft building in
Times Square. What was I doing there? &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/aankit?lang=en&#34;&gt;Aankit Patel&lt;/a&gt; invited me to check
out the professional development that he and his team organized for
the teachers involved in the assorted CSforAllNYC programs that his
office runs. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Wow.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lots of great things going on. I was only able to stay for a couple of
hours but I spent some time in two rooms run by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tealsk12.org/&#34;&gt;TEALS&lt;/a&gt;, a room of &lt;a href=&#34;https://bjc.berkeley.edu/&#34;&gt;BJC&lt;/a&gt;
teachers, a group working with &lt;a href=&#34;https://p5js.org&#34;&gt;p5.js&lt;/a&gt;, one doing physical computing and
a bunch more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While there was good content all around I was really impressed with
the sense of community in many of the rooms. One of the hardest parts
of being a computer science teacher in K12 is that you&amp;#39;re frequently
the only CS teacher in your school. That can be an awfully lonely
existence. It&amp;#39;s hard to be the only teacher. No one to bounce lesson
ideas off of or to debrief with and if you leave your school they&amp;#39;re
left in the lurch. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s simply amazing that all these NYC teachers have opportunities
like this past weekends PD and the communty it provides. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, teachers who are not part of city programs like
SEP or TEALS don&amp;#39;t have these opportunities and at Hunter we&amp;#39;re trying
to do our piece to help solve that problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A few months ago I wrote about our plans to roll out once a month
professional development sessions for CTLE hours specifically aimed at
teachers who are ready for the next step. Those who are already
comfortable with the first courses and student experiences. I&amp;#39;m
describing the sessions as being for high school teachers teaching
APCS-A, similar or beyond.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Were hosting our first session on December 13th. There will be a
couple of presentations or activities to get us started but the bulk
of the time will be about planning the rest of the sessions which will
run until the end of the school year and the hope is that we will
cover both content beyond the basics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, if you&amp;#39;re a public school CS teacher in NYC (and need CTLE hours)
and you&amp;#39;re ready for something more advanced than the usual PD
opportunities, why don&amp;#39;t you join us. Just sign up &lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/forms/FJDyCx7qFec1yPjr1&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Space is
limited so if we fill, we&amp;#39;ll add you to the waitlist and we&amp;#39;ll work on
trying to find a bigger space to acomodate more teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking forward to getting this thing started!!!!
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>When the students know more than the teacher</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/students-know-more/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Oct 2018 16:07:09 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/students-know-more/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;ve heard it many times with computer science - &amp;#34;the kids know more
than the teacher.&amp;#34; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the one hand, the truth is that this isn&amp;#39;t so much the case. Kids
might use computers all the time but they don&amp;#39;t necessarily know
much about them or about computer science (&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/oldblog/keyboarding-dig-divite/&#34;&gt;link 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-01-15-kids-know-nuttin.html/&#34;&gt;link 2&lt;/a&gt;). Then
you have students who think they know all about CS but really
don&amp;#39;t. They might have picked up a bit of coding somewhere but more
often than not, the knowledge is pretty superficial.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, you do have some cases where the students or a
subset of them do know more than the teacher. As K12 CS Education is
fairly nascent many of our teachers are brand new to the subject
matter. You might have kids who&amp;#39;s parents have a background and teach
them, kids who&amp;#39;s previous school had a solid program or you might have
some kids that are in that minority of people who can do it all on
their own. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In some cases, this problem will work itself out over time. States are
starting to require certification to teach computer science. Some of
these states have requirements that when met will result in teachers
who have a solid background in CS. In these cases, the problem will
eventually mostly be solved. Of course this will take years if not
decades and in states with weaker requirements the issue will never
disappear.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The issue of having students knowing more than the teacher isn&amp;#39;t
always a problem. A solid teacher can make sure a kid that&amp;#39;s ahead of
the class doesn&amp;#39;t dominate and intimidate the rest of the class and as
long as the teacher adds some value to that student things can work
out. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event, I was thinking earlier today that as our subject area
gains traction and starts to mature, perhaps we can learn from other
fields where students knowing more than teachers is not that uncommon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The subjects that come to mind for me are art and music. Even though
NY has decimated it&amp;#39;s programs, there are still a few out there. When
I grew up and also through my children&amp;#39;s years in school there were
always students in all our music classes that were exceptional and well
beyond their respective teachers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I never gave it much thought until now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know that the disciplines are different but I wonder if there&amp;#39;s
something us CS teachers can learn from music and art teachers in
terms of dealing with this issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just some food for thought.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Talking about CS teacher certification at CSTA 2018</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/csta-2018/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
As I mentioned in my last post, this coming weekend is the Computer
Science Teachers Association (CSTA) conference. I&amp;#39;ve been a member of
CSTA since the beginning but this will be only the second time I&amp;#39;ve
made it to the annual conference.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The CSTA conference might be the largest conference specifically for
k12 computer science teachers and that makes it different from
conferences like SIGCSE which is for CS education and education
research at all levels or ISTE which seems to be more of an Ed Tech
conference.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I really enjoyed the conference last year but as the sessions seemed
to be weighted towards beginning CS teachers and towards the CSTA
standards I found most of the value in the &amp;#34;hallway track&amp;#34; when I got
to meet and chat with CS teachers from all over the country.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Glancing at the program, there looks to be a bunch of interesting
sessions and this time more sessions that I think I&amp;#39;ll personally be
interested in .
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m also giving a talk. New York State just approved and created K12
Computer Science Teacher Certification and we&amp;#39;re currently making
plans to roll out our Masters and Certificate programs for CS teachers
as soon as we get state approval. The Masters program will be largely
for preservice teacher candidates and the certificate program for in
service teachers certified in other areas.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The talk will cover a bit of the history of CS Education in New York,
what the state is doing and mostly what where building at Hunter and
why. It should be a fun talk. I&amp;#39;m hoping for some people from other
states attend so we can have a rich discussion during the session.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, if you&amp;#39;re going to be at the CSTA conference, I&amp;#39;d love to see
you either at my session or at the conference in general. I&amp;#39;ll be
spending most of my non session time there with my friends at GitHub
education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For those of you can&amp;#39;t make it, I hope to blog about the weekend and I
hope others do as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Giving control of NYC&#39;s specialized schools to a political appointee</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/shsat-part2/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/shsat-part2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday I shared my thoughts on Bill de Blasio&amp;#39;s plans to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; the
selection criteria for New York City&amp;#39;s specialized high schools. If
you haven&amp;#39;t read the post, you can find it &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/shsat/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was going to get back to CS and CS Ed related blogging today but
there&amp;#39;s more to the story.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In spite of what BdB stated, it&amp;#39;s not enough for him to switch to another
measure - the middle school state exam along with some modifiers. This
is about ending the exam altogether and not replacing it with anything
better. Here&amp;#39;s a link to information on the proposed legislation for
&lt;a href=&#34;https://legiscan.com/NY/bill/A10427/2017&#34;&gt;New York Assembly Bill 10427&lt;/a&gt; including links to the actual text.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s a lot of beurobabble but the end game is to basically allow
the chancellor (not sure if this means city or state) to do whatever
they want.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here are some of the key points:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Seats would ultimately go to the top 5 to 7 percent of each middle school&amp;#39;s
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
class.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These students would have to also be classified in the top 25% city wide.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Top is defined by a composite score of multiple measures as
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
determined by the chancellor which means anything goes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Remaining seats will be filled by
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
lottery of all students with a 3.7 GPA or greater.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s not clear how the students would be allocated to each of the
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
specialized schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what does this all mean?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Multiple measures could mean the state test + average. It could mean
average + recommendation. It could be shoe size + favorite color. The
chancellor also decides how to weight these multiple measures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This means that the politicians can do whatever they want to paint any
picture they want regardless of how their ideological and political
games hurt kids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Any teacher, in fact, any rational adult  will tell you that middle
schools are not interchangeable. The top students at one middle school
are typically not at the same level as top students at another
one. I&amp;#39;m sure you can cluster middle schools in terms of the students
they graduate, what the students know and can do and the clusters will
likely fall on economic lines. This is the problem that BdB should be
addressing not how to rig the specialized school admissions stats.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if this is done right, you&amp;#39;re assuming an even distribution of
top gifted students across all the middle schools. If one school has
higher concentration of gifted students, they&amp;#39;re out of luck. The end
result is that if you attend an SP or other gifted program for eighth
grade you&amp;#39;ll likely be locked out of the specialized schools. What if
a particular middle school is attractive to all of our top math team
talent? Only a couple will get in to the specialized schools under the
new system since each school is allocated a fixed number of slots.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I guess this does make sense if you don&amp;#39;t believe in gifted students
or gifted education but then why not just get rid of the specialized
schools to begin with rather than playing these games. This &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34;
will result in parents having to decide - do I send my kids to the
gifted middle school program and hurt their chances to get into a
specialized high school or do I try to find the lowest performing
school I can find and have my kid stand out. This is pretty messed up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the day, though, you have to remember that any change to
the process can help one group and hurt another. Stuy, for example has
46% of it&amp;#39;s students on free or reduced lunch and is about 70%
Asian. If in the new system you&amp;#39;re increasing the percent population
of an under represented group, you&amp;#39;re likely reducing the percentage
of Asian students. So, you&amp;#39;re creating opportunities for a number of as of yet
undetermined students (who might not be properly prepared for the
experience) at the expense of economically disadvantaged Asian
students who have proven to be prepared for the experience. Wouldn&amp;#39;t
a better solution be to fix the opportunities presented at the middle
schools rather than rig the system of high school acceptance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Going further, a response on another blog noted that BdB probably
refused to do anything with the admissions criteria of the non big
three because they all had numbers that he would consider more
diverse. The commenter provided the Black / Latino percentages, I added the
free and reduced lunch numbers:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border-spacing=&#34;10px&#34; frame=&#34;border&#34;&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;School&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Percent Black / Latino&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Free / Reduced Lunch&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Brooklyn Latin&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;28%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;61%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;HSMSE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;26%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;46%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;HSAS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;25%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Queens Sci&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;64%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All the more reason to run some tests or analysis there. Of course, if
you look further you&amp;#39;ll note that HSAS only has 25% of its students on
free or reduced lunch so is it really doing better than Stuy or Sci
with ~45% low income students  each  or Brooklyn Tech which supports
62% or are we to say that there&amp;#39;s low income and then there&amp;#39;s the
right low income?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Certainly the education system needs work but the proposed legislation
is not a solution. It&amp;#39;s taking a flawed but objective measure and
replacing it with essentially chancellor&amp;#39;s discretion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the legislation passes, by the year 2022 we will have admissions to
what used to be some of the nations finest high schools determined by
a political appointee rather than an objective test.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s a shame. It was very important to my wife and me to have our kids
go to public schools and I was very happy to have been able to
navigate the system with them from first grade through high school
graduation with only a few bumps along the way. With this nonsense
from the political left and the privatization push from the political
right (or actually both sides) pretty soon there will be nothing left.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Changing Admissions to the NYC Specialized High Schools</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/shsat/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/shsat/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, Bill de Blasio, the current Mayor of New York City outlined
how he would &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; our specialized schools. The schools he was
referring to were the &amp;#34;big three&amp;#34; of Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, and
Brooklyn Tech and then five additional schools - The High School  for
Math Science and Engineering at CCNY, The High School for American
Studies at Lehman, Brooklyn Latin, The Queens Arts and Science High
School at
York College, and Staten Island Tech.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All use a single SAT style test, the SHSAT, for admission. The Big Three are
locked into that system unless there are changes made by the state
legislature. The Mayor can make changes to the admissions criteria of
the other five on his own.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problem, as stated by Chalkbeat writers Alex Zimmerman and  Monica
Disare is that:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The city’s specialized high schools — considered some of the crown
jewels of New York City’s education system — accept students based on
a single test score. Over the last decade, they have come under fire
for offering admissions to few students of color: While two-thirds of
city students are black or Hispanic, only about 10 percent of
admissions offers to those schools go to black or Hispanic students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I normally don&amp;#39;t write about things like this but given my history at
and with Stuyvesant I thought I should.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before getting started, my biases - I believe in public schools, not
charters, I also believe that a system should have gifted programs and
magnet schools and also a mix of large comprehensive schools and
smaller niche ones. Additionally, while I do believe in gifted
programs I&amp;#39;m not sure at what point it makes sense to start offering
them. When we were looking at elementary schools for our own kids we
opted for a neighborhood public school rather than applying to the
district gifted program as we felt it offered a better overall
education. On the other hand, had our kids not made Stuyvesant, I&amp;#39;m
not sure what we would have done. Part of that was due to the fact
that the Bloomberg administration destroyed just about all the large
comprehensive schools so, other than that large test schools and
LaGuardia, good luck finding a school that was strong in the
humanities, sciences and offered a robust music program.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
The overall picture
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For reference, here are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theschoolboards.com/showthread.php/4324-Specialized-High-School-SHSAT-Cutoff-Scores-for-2018&#34;&gt;unofficial cutoff scores&lt;/a&gt; for the specialized
schools from 2018 along with the NY State data on free and reduced
lunch for 2017. Note that there&amp;#39;s overlap between the schools. I
separated out SI Tech since geography probably affects it&amp;#39;s numbers
more than the other schools and I separated the big three from the
remaining four because I think the three are all substantially larger. The
free and reduced lunch percent is important because I believe an
entire school qualifies for Title I funding if the number&amp;#39;s
over 40 so while these schools are not populated entirely by low
income students, all but HSAS has a substantial number and there&amp;#39;s a
chance, some say a good one that at best BdB&amp;#39;s plans will merely
shuffle which low income kids get in rather than actually solving the
root problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
The plan
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
Part 1 - test prep
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s idea here is that test prep is rampant for SHSAT and that the
test can be gamed. This may or may not be true but if it is then it&amp;#39;s
safe to assume that a lot of low income kids are doing test
prep either by prioritizing test prep programs in family budgets,
working off of an SHSAT test prep book or by attending a middle school
that has some form of prep.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There has long been a program on the books called &amp;#34;The Discovery
Program&amp;#34; which has a free city run test prep component and also a
summer component. The summer component is for low income students who
score within &amp;#34;a few points&amp;#34; of the school in question&amp;#39;s cutoff
score. At the end of the summer, I believe the students retest and in
general make the school in question.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This program is a good thing and should be reinstated&lt;/strong&gt; but I don&amp;#39;t
know if it will result in the changes that BdB is looking for. More
likely Stuy will get its discovery kids from Science and Science from
Tech. As there are already many low income students at all of the
schools there&amp;#39;s no indication that this would increase the number of
under represented groups which is BdB&amp;#39;s goal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s also worth noting that there&amp;#39;s a sizable chunk of Brooklyn Tech
students that don&amp;#39;t perform particularly well on regents exams.
Everyone knows I&amp;#39;m not a fan of standardized tests and I don&amp;#39;t
believe that students that score a &amp;#34;few points&amp;#34; lower on the SHSAT are
any less qualified to be in a specialized school but at the lowest
performing end of these schools, one has to ask how specialized is it
really?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
Part 2 - use state test scores instead of the SHSAT
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This &lt;strong&gt;could be&lt;/strong&gt; a &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; good thing with one major caveat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Twenty one middle schools produce over half the students that
ultimately are accepted to the specialized schools. For the rest,
there are a few reasons
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many students don&amp;#39;t take the SHSAT.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There have been stories of schools steering kids away from the
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
specialized schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s no culture in those schools of striving for specialized
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
school acceptance or attendance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The academic programs at those schools don&amp;#39;t prepare students for
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
the SHSAT exam for reasons that we&amp;#39;re not going to delve into here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All students already take the NY State middle school Math and English
exams. Yes, it would further raise the stakes for those exams but it
would ensure that the specialized schools are on the map for everyone,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The big question here is &amp;#34;do the current state exams cover enough
material in enough depth to select and differentiate for gifted
programs.&amp;#34; I don&amp;#39;t know the answer to this question. If they don&amp;#39;t
then using state test scores will be a disaster. If they do, then they
could be a suitable alternative.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-5&#34;&gt;
Part 3 - admissions from every middle school
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is the third part of BdB&amp;#39;s proposal - guarantee admissions to the
top 10% of students at every middle school.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This could be a real disaster either for the students or for the
schools. There&amp;#39;s no question that students coming out of different
middle schools are at different levels of preparedness for the
specialized schools. Arguably the most obvious difference is that some
middle schools offer algebra and others don&amp;#39;t.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For better or worse, the specialized school&amp;#39;s curricula, classes, and
overall programs have evolved hand in hand with the exam. If you all
of a sudden end up placing a large number of students with a
different and arguable weaker academic profile into these schools one
of two things will happen. Either the students will struggle immensely
or the school will have to lower its standards. There&amp;#39;s no two ways
about it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you set standards for academic preparedness for the specialized
schools either by making a hard cutoff on an exam score be it state or
SHSAT and then spread those acceptances across all the schools maybe
it could work. If not, you&amp;#39;re setting up students with high grades at
schools with weak programs up for failure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another problem is what to do with non-public school students -
private schools, charters which take public money but act as private
schools, parochial, and home school students. Where do they fall in to
this equation?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-6&#34;&gt;
Is one measure bad?
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So there you have my thoughts on BdB&amp;#39;s specific proposals but I also
want to address his contention that a single measure is bad and makes
the comparison to colleges where they by and large use multiple
measures. This is a ridiculous comparison. Yes, colleges look at
multiple measures but after watching decades of Stuy students go off
to college, it&amp;#39;s clear to me that the process is by no means fair or
consistent. Elite schools can easily game their acceptances and
they still can have 100% of their applicants with off the charts SAT
scores.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A single test might not be ideal but it can only be gamed by test prep
and test prep can be as cheap as buying a test prep book.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As to other measures that come up from time to time - interviews,
portfolios, essays - who does that help? The low income kid or the
well to do one?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re going to add another measure for admission it has to be
something that can&amp;#39;t be gamed or politically influenced,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-7&#34;&gt;
Alternatives
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Should the city address the fact that there are groups that are under
represented at the specialized schools? Certainly, or rather, the city
should address deficiencies in opportunities that are like the causes
of this under representation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Should the city be doing things differently? Also yes. Here are some
thoughts on what the city can and should be doing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-8&#34;&gt;
Do the experiments in the non-big three.
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are five specialized schools that aren&amp;#39;t covered by state
legislation. Why not run your experiments there. You&amp;#39;ve got  the big
three as a control group and what&amp;#39;s more if you look at the
&amp;#34;acceptance score windows&amp;#34; in the table above, you&amp;#39;ll see that there&amp;#39;s
enough overlap that you can probably get some real data out of these
experiments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why not change the admissions criteria for one or two of them and see
how it goes before jumping in whole hog. Figure out if anything works first.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-9&#34;&gt;
Check existing data
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;ve got SHSAT results and State Test score results along with
student grades for years. Why not study correlations between
them. Rather than making a specious claim about middle school grades
in NYC Public Schools vs state tests vs the SHSAT, run the
numbers. Take a look at student high school performance based on these
predictions. This shouldn&amp;#39;t be guess work and city should have the
data to do better.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-10&#34;&gt;
Fix the middle schools
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This one is more pie in the sky because no politician really wants to
take this one but you&amp;#39;ve got to look at what&amp;#39;s going on in the middle
schools and why.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tweeted this the other day:
&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;would love to see this experiment - take the entire staff / faculty / admin of one of the 20 or so middle schools that are the primary feeders to the spec schls and swap them with another middle school and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/1003074760786501632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;June 3, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The truth is that if you did this, the high performing school would
probably continue to be high performing and the low performing one
would still struggle. There&amp;#39;s only so much a teacher can do. A school
with a disadvantaged population needs the resources to succeed - lower
class sizes for a start. Add wraparound services, extensive after
school and weekend opportunities - make the schools a part of the
community and maybe we can get somewhere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another question relating to our schools in general is to look at
attrition rates to private schools - how many students in our under
represented groups are being siphoned off to private schools on
scholarship. I don&amp;#39;t have any data for this. It could be an
insignificant amount or it could go a long way in explaining the
downturn in the numbers over the decades.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-11&#34;&gt;
So where are we
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are a lot of changes I&amp;#39;d love to see in our public schools and I
do believe BdB&amp;#39;s heart is in the right place. I&amp;#39;m concerned that some
of the solutions that he and other politicians come up with will hurt
the current low income students at the specialized schools and
unintentionally advantage the well to do while not helping those that
at least BdB may honestly want to help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He should enact Discovery and research the State Tests but proceed
with caution. The test schools have always been and continue to be a
gateway for poor and immigrant students and any changes that are
proposed should be weighed carefully and &lt;strong&gt;tested&lt;/strong&gt; before taking steps
that could real harm when good is intended.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
I tweeted this the other day:
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Why don&amp;#39;t so many  teachers and professors understand that the test or assignment you can do in 15 minutes will take your beginning students at least an hour and probably a lot more to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/986609723557404673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;April 18, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What led to the tweet was a discussion I was having with some students
about not having enough time on tests which led to a discussion of
having to drop everything to spend every waking hour on a project.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s talk about tests.
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not saying that tests are the best forms of assessment - most of
the time I&amp;#39;d much rather have students work on projects. There are,
however, times when tests make sense or are otherwise appropriate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event, writing a test is hard. Rather, writing good test is
hard. It&amp;#39;s certianly easy enough to put a bunch of multiple choice or
short answer questions on paper and it&amp;#39;s easy enough to give a hard
equation to solve or some code to write but creating a good test is a
task and half. You first have to figure out what you&amp;#39;re trying to
assess - memory, thought process, synthesizing concepts? Then you want
to construct questions that give you insights into your students
knowledge and thought process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some things that I consider when putting together a test:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Does it ramp up in difficulty - that is, are there some &amp;#34;gimme
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
questions&amp;#34; and some challenges.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Are questions all or nothing - if a kid doesn&amp;#39;t see things my way
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
are they dead in the water.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Will the test repeatedly penalize or reward the same concept over
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and over again on the test.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Do I cover all the concepts I want to assess.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Do you make kids waste time with boilerplate code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Do the questions take so long to read and digest that there&amp;#39;s little
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
time to form and write down answers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Do the answers convey anything about the students thought process or
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
just correctness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is it easy or impossible to grade and grade fairly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about length? To me a well crafted test should be completed by
the average student with a few minutes to spare - enough time to check
a couple of answers. This is not to say that they&amp;#39;ll ace the exam,
just finish it. Far too many teachers make tests an assessment of
speed and accuracy at speed rather than understanding. That might
actually be important in certain contexts - preparing for the APCS-A
multiple choice section as an example but in general, it&amp;#39;s not a good
way of assessing what a student really knows.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s also important that the the average student can achieve a score
that you expect from an average student. That&amp;#39;s probably in the 80s on
a 0-100 scale or a B. Yes, I know, C is supposed to be average but
with grade inflation being what it is…
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You should &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; give an assessment where the average score is
something like 17 out of 100 with the top student earning a 37. Sure,
you can curve it but it also places a lot of stress on the
students. You might do this from time to time - you might misjudge the
difficulty of a test or your class but it shouldn&amp;#39;t be a regular
occurence. Teachers sometimes forget about the psychological affect
that a unfair test can have on a student even if the teacher &amp;#34;fixes&amp;#34; it
after the fact.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Don&amp;#39;t be afraid to experiment or have some fun.
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s also ok to try different things. One year, having just completed
a unit on Cellualar Automata I decided to give a quiz. I figured it
would take the kids 10 to 15 minutes so I gave them 30. The quiz was
something like the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You have 30 minutes to compose something on a sheet of paper that when
I review it convinces me that you know something about the Cellular
Automata Unit we just completed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some kids loved the quiz, some hated it. The ones that hated it had
been trained for years as expert standardized test takers and this
level of freedom really freaked the out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another time, I gave a multi page test of serious questions mixed with
crazy shenanigans. Question one would be some CS problem followed by
some instructions like &amp;#34;stand up, do 5 jumping jacks and sit down&amp;#34; or
&amp;#34;shout out your favorite olde timey exclamation&amp;#34; or even &amp;#34;stand up, if
or when you see another student standing, switch seats with the and
continue the test.&amp;#34; The test started with explicit instructions not to
read ahead but to read and do each question in order. The last page
was the answer key and I asked the kids to self-grade. Interestingly
enough the grading was pretty honest. After that one, I received a few
apology emails from kids who read to the end first encouraging me to
give them failing grades for cheating. Wow, I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting
that. The test was something of an end of year goof. The CS questions
were really easy - I wanted to reward them with something silly and
easy - a guaranteed A after a year of hard work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
Tests to drive instruction and future practice
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a final point to ponder, tests shouldn&amp;#39;t only be about grades. A
well crafted test should drive instruction. Kids will get answers
wrong - will your questions be crafted so that you can gain insights
into why the got them wrong.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In an early class you might notice things like:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
kids printing rather than returning answers
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
kids not understanding scope
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
kids having difficulty with idioms like &lt;code&gt;i=i+1&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
kids needing more scaffolding to approach a problem
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This can drive instruction moving forward.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over time you&amp;#39;ll also learn how to fine tune your tests and other
assessments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
Next time, we&amp;#39;ll talk about projects
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unless of course I get distracted by another blog topic or shiny
object.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tools and Complexity</title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/tools-and-complexity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alfredtwo&#34;&gt;Alfred Thompson&lt;/a&gt; wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2018/04/thoughts-on-where-cs-education-tools.html&#34;&gt;CS education tools&lt;/a&gt; earlier today. I&amp;#39;ve
also been meaning to write on the topic but from a different point of
view.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I do my best to keep up with the latest and greatest in the CS world
both on the academic side as well as the professional one. That&amp;#39;s not
really possible, but I do my best. When I have a small project to work
on I&amp;#39;ll some times use it as an excuse to play with some recent
technology. Over December, I wanted to write an application viewer to
use for company / student internship matching. I started by looking at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://reactjs.org/&#34;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; but ended up using &lt;a href=&#34;https://vuejs.org/&#34;&gt;Vue.js&lt;/a&gt; which I liked much more for a variety
of reasons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The viewer served it&amp;#39;s purpose but I think it can be turned into a
much more comprehensive student / employer internship platform. I
tried to steal a few minutes over this past week&amp;#39;s spring break to
start a rewrite using another toolset, Clojure, Clojurescript and
Reagent. I&amp;#39;m really liking the Clojure stack and using
Emacs and Cider for the IDE is really blowing me away.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What I&amp;#39;ve noticed is that for every new language of framework you also
have to learn a whole set of ancillary tools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It didn&amp;#39;t used to be that way. Back in the day, things were much
simpler. I remembering doing work at Goldman Sachs, it was as simple
as typing something on the command line like &lt;code&gt;cc file1.c file2.c
file3.c&lt;/code&gt;. I of course had to be cutting edge and use fancy modern
tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/make/&#34;&gt;Make&lt;/a&gt;. What&amp;#39;s more, the tools I used in industry were very
similar to what I used in college.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We now live in very different times.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you go to the getting started guides for React or Vue it&amp;#39;s pretty easy to
get hello world up and running but beyond that you start to fall in to
the Javascript tooling hole. To start you need either &lt;strong&gt;npm&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;yarn&lt;/strong&gt;
just to manage packages and dependencies. Then you need a build system
or bundler like &lt;strong&gt;webpack&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;browserify&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;parcel&lt;/strong&gt; and that&amp;#39;s not even
considering older options like &lt;strong&gt;gulp&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;grunt&lt;/strong&gt; and ancillary tools
like &lt;strong&gt;babel&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A typical React or Vue project is going to need a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/krasimir/react-webpack-starter/blob/master/package.json&#34;&gt;project.json&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/krasimir/react-webpack-starter/blob/master/webpack.config.js&#34;&gt;webpack.config.js&lt;/a&gt; file and sometimes some other files as well. Check
out the links. They&amp;#39;re from a simple project template I found
online. Far from simple.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I was playing with Vue.js a couple of months ago, I ended up
using Webpack to convert the source code into the final JS, take care
of live-reloading, and in general manage the project. I still have no
idea how most of it works. I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s just me but I&amp;#39;m very
uncomfortable relying on tools that I really don&amp;#39;t fully understand to
build my systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Clojure world is little better with Leiningen and Boot. If you
don&amp;#39;t believe me, try to make heads or tails of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bhauman/figwheel-template/blob/master/src/leiningen/new/figwheel/project.clj&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While it&amp;#39;s true that as a professional you&amp;#39;ll likely use one set of
tools on a day to day basis and you&amp;#39;ll eventually get to know them
that doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s not a good idea to prepare kids for what&amp;#39;s to
come.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the K12 side we have drag and drop languages, specialized learning
IDEs like BlueJ, simple cut down IDEs like Dr Racket and completely
online environments like repl.it. All great starter tools that
insulate beginners from the complexities to come. College&amp;#39;s
might get closer to the &amp;#34;real world&amp;#34; but just a tad.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I like many of the tools used in K12
classes and there&amp;#39;s far too much complexity in the professional world to
throw at beginners. If we look at a student&amp;#39;s entire school
career, classes are already so packed with material it would be hard to
really prepare kids for the real world within their classes. You could
take that tried and true teacher / professor technique of just
requiring it and having the kids figure it out on their own but that&amp;#39;s
really just downright abusive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t have an answer for this one.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have my kids use tools like Git and GitHub early along with using
testing frameworks and external libraries. I also try to move my
students to a general purpose programmable platform like Emacs or
Vim. I think these are sound practices but students will still have a
big learning curve when they finally get to industry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What I really would love it to see the tooling become simpler and
documentation better. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel&#34;&gt;Parcel&lt;/a&gt;, a Javascript bundler is one of the newer
kids on the block and is much simpler and cleaner than alternatives
like Webpack. The new version of Clojure has it&amp;#39;s own command line
tool which is also simpler than the alternatives. Maybe we are already
moving in the right direction and this entire rant will become moot in a couple of years.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ethics In CS Education</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ethics-in-cs/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ethics-in-cs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to write about ethics in CS education for a
while. Probably since I saw &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/business/computer-science-ethics-courses.html?smid=fb-share&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; in the NY Times but got sidetracked.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was reminded when I saw this tweet by Hadi the other day:
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;This message is bigger than Facebook. Computer science faces an ethics crisis. That’s why &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/codeorg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@codeorg&lt;/a&gt; covers ethics and digital citizenship in our computer science courses. (And we’re thankful that most of the largest tech companies support us) &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/roSkAzANQM&#34;&gt;https://t.co/roSkAzANQM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Hadi Partovi (@hadip) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hadip/status/977673429485731840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;March 24, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think we can all agree that bringing ethics and digital citizenship
and, frankly, citizenship in general to our students is important. What I wonder is
what approaches will lead to meaningful results and what methods will
lead us to checking off the &amp;#34;covered that&amp;#34; box.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m skeptical of throwing an ethics course into the curriculum as some
places seem to be doing. A class might be required, might fulfill an
elective requirement or it might just be an extra course. If it&amp;#39;s
required, what does it replace or are you just going to add more to
the student load. If it fulfills an elective credit, will it be
perceived as &amp;#34;the easy course&amp;#34; as opposed to say, theory and if it&amp;#39;s
just an extra course, who&amp;#39;s going to take it? Will it just become
preaching to the choir.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Better is what Hadi mentioned in his tweet - embed ethics throughout
all of your courses and while I think this type of embedding is
important and I&amp;#39;d argue necessary, I&amp;#39;m still betting it won&amp;#39;t be
enough to make a difference.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When teaching a course, teachers cover the curriculum but when you
drill down to where they focus their time, it comes down to:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
what they think is important for the kids to know.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
what they think the kids will need for that high stakes exam.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If a teacher feels embedding ethical concerns is important they&amp;#39;ll
spend time on it, if not, it will be lip service. Even if it&amp;#39;s on the
high stakes exam, unless the teacher really believes that this is
important it will just be teaching to the test.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;d argue that it has to go even further since teachers can only do so
much. How many schools have honor codes and how many of us know
graduates from those schools who exhibit less than ethical behaviour.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So what do we do?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Well, of course we do have to embed ethical concerns across the
curriculum. Teachers should be armed with both the materials and time
needed to address ethical concerns but beyond that, we need teachers
for which ethical CS is important.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ed_saber&#34;&gt;Saber Khan&lt;/a&gt; has been facilitating a monthly #ethicalCS
twitter chat for close to a year now. I don&amp;#39;t take part in too many
twitter chats but do recognize that they&amp;#39;re important in raising both
awareness and community. I&amp;#39;ve also seen ethical CS issues more
frequently appear as conference sessions and professional development.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next big step is to start at the beginning - pre service teacher
training and in my opinion, not with a course but rather embedding
ethical issues throughout teacher preparation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we want to crack this nut it can&amp;#39;t just be from curriculum and from
the choir. Pre service CS teacher training is in it&amp;#39;s infancy and has
not yet really found its form.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Much to my chagrin, a lot of CS Ed has gone the way of other Ed: Math
Ed, Science Ed, etc. and not in a good way. Let&amp;#39;s see if we can make
sure that pre service CS teacher preparation develops to attract and
create great teachers for which ethical CS is part of their core.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Prestigious Competitons And High Schools</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/on-prestigious-competitons-and-high-schools/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/on-prestigious-competitons-and-high-schools/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The ACM recently announced this year&amp;#39;s winners of the Cutler-Bell
Prize in High School Computing. Over on his blog, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alfredtwo&#34;&gt;Alfred Thompson&lt;/a&gt;
noted that the winners were either from independent or magnet public
schools. Alfred also noted that most of the winners of prestigious
science competitions like the Regeneron Science Talent Search (nee
Intel, nee Westinghouse) were from public magnet schools. In &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2018/03/impressive-high-school-computer-science.html%0A&#34;&gt;his post&lt;/a&gt;,
Alfred ruminates on this and wonders &amp;#34;how to we add the flexibility
and support to more students at more schools?&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As someone who spent over 25 years at Stuyvesant, arguably the
granddaddy of these public magnet schools, I wanted to share some
thoughts. I can only share my experiences from Stuy along with what I
know from a few other schools but I still hope this is worth a read.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Regeneron competitions under it&amp;#39;s various names is the oldest and
most established of these competition so it&amp;#39;s pretty easy to get some
data. Stuy is at or near the top of the list in terms of Regeneron
finalists and semi finalists. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneron_Science_Talent_Search&#34;&gt;Wikipediapage&lt;/a&gt; lists Stuy as second
to Montgomery Blair with 22 finalists to 40 but the data only goes
back to 1999. I personally know of at least 7 more finalists from my
early years at Stuy, 4 more from the early 90s, 8 more listed under
the page&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;notable&amp;#34; entries and who kows how many from the 80s and
earlier.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stuy had a strong run of finalists in the early 90&amp;#39;s and the early
2000&amp;#39;s but there has been a fall off in recent years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s look at what makes Stuy &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; and then at the fall off.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In terms of money, Stuy gets a basic budget similar to other NYC
public schools plus some extra due to the extra graduation
requirements (other schools get extra money for an assortment of
reasons). I seem to recall that the Parents Association raises
somewhere in the low to mid six figures and the Alumni Association has
been historically dysfunctional as a fundraising body.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, it&amp;#39;s not money.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Flexible scheduling? That&amp;#39;s something that Alfred mentioned. Stuy kids
have super packed programs. Some kids take 10 classes a day with no
lunch so that&amp;#39;s not it either.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teachers? Stuy gets its teachers the same way as other public
schools and just like other public schools they have some terrific
teachers and some absolute disasters. Stuy also gets a slice of a
particular class of teacher that starts their career at Stuy, never
learns to teach because the kids figure it out but thinks they&amp;#39;re gods
gift to teaching.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, no, it&amp;#39;s not the teachers, at least not on the whole.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what does Stuy do?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It collects talent and this is the same thing that the other magnet
schools and the elite private schools do as well. Get a bunch of
bright, hard working, motivated kids together and good things
happen. It gets high achieving students from a combination of entrance
exam, reputation, and location [fn::That said, students have also been
drawn to Stuy for the CS program which is fairly unique and also for a
couple of specific math teachers.].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not arguing against this – I think there is a need for public
magnet schools like Stuy but I think it&amp;#39;s important to recognize that
this is a major contributor to competition results and doesn&amp;#39;t
necessarily say anything about the school in terms of leadership or
instruction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s similar to a college coach who gets the best recruits. Are they
really a great coach? Can they develop talent or are they just getting
the best talent and getting out of the way. Who&amp;#39;s the better coach?
The one who gets all the 5 star recruits every years and frequently
wins it all or the coach who gets 3 star recruits, doesn&amp;#39;t win as much
but develops those 3 stars to a point where they can compete against the 5 star
programs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s the starting point but then there&amp;#39;s the targeting of the top
prospects. Stuy had a run of finalists during the early 2000s. At the
time, a friend of mine ran the math research program. His strategy? He
would scour the school for the kids most likely to win the
competition, get those kids into his class, and hook them  up with
professors with the most promising project potential. It worked
more often than not. Contrast that to what I did when I ran our CS
research program. I didn&amp;#39;t take the program seriously for a variety of
reasons but my job was to give EVERY kid in my class the opportunity
to explore some aspect of CS. I had a few semi-finalists which is
neither here nor there but never the stream of winners that my friend
had.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking back to Stuy&amp;#39;s earlier success, we had a Bio Chair who ran a
similar program. I knew people in that program from when I was a
student. The top talent was recruited and nurtured, the rest, pretty
much ignored. Makes a school look good but not really the hallmark of
a great school
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Other schools had a similar strategy. Back in the &amp;#39;80s Cardozo - a
neighborhood high school in Bayside Queens had a great run of
Westinghouse results but that&amp;#39;s because the science chair at the time
had a similar program - rope in the top talent early (sophomore year)
and nurture them. After a while the school got a reputation and would
then attract more &amp;#34;science talent.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stuy&amp;#39;s had a falloff in finalists in recent years and I believe that&amp;#39;s
due to not having anyone focusing on recruiting kids specifically for
results. Personally, I think this is a good thing but others
disagree. A school with one finalist is perceived to be better than a
school that gives a great research experience to every student but
produces no finalists. In recent years, there&amp;#39;s been talk of &amp;#34;what
can we do to get more winners again.&amp;#34; I think that&amp;#39;s a shame, the
conversation should always be &amp;#34;what can we do to improve the
educational experience we offer all of our students.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
None of this is to take away from any of the winners of  any of these
competitions. All the finalists and winners I&amp;#39;ve known have been
exceptional intellects and top people in their fields. This is just a
commentary on what role a school does, should, and shouldn&amp;#39;t play.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my early years at Stuy, I worked with our top kids on CS
competitions, The kids would place very well in the USACO competitions
throughout the year. One year we entered the ACSL and I realized that
I had a choice - focus on the top handful of kids to make a winning
team that could compete for the title or focus on all the kids but not
expect that great single result. I realized that the top kids
would probably be alright without that extra attention.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I still think I did right by those kids but that realization also led
me to design my intro class, hack required CS into Stuy and probably
end up positively affecting far more students than if I just focused
on the top percent of a percent.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sigcse2018 Making theory more acccesible</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse2018-theory/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse2018-theory/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Next up from SIGCSE 2018 is John MacCormick&amp;#39;s session on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3159557&#34;&gt;Strategies for Baing the CS Theory Course on Non-decision Problems&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
MacCormicks&amp;#39;s stance is that CS theory  is tough the first time around
and using non-decision problems is a viable approach to make theory
more accessible to beginners. As MacCormick said in his paper:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
… a decision problem may ask the yes/no question, &amp;#34;Does this graph
have a Hamilton cycle?&amp;#34; The corresponding non-decision problem is,
&amp;#34;Please give me a Hamilton cycle of this graph if it has one.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This leads to writing programs to explore concepts in CS theory rather
than just living in the world of proof.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
MacCormick goes on to say that:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For this audience, the key advantage of non-decision problems
is that they are more realistic: they match the previous programming
and algorithms experience of undergraduates more closely.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I love the idea. Writing a program can make an abstract problem more
concrete and can lead to better understanding for those of us who are
less math inclined.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My next thought was that this shouldn&amp;#39;t just be a change implemented
in theory courses. Some of these ideas should move down to more
introductory CS classes. Not the hardcore stuff but light
introductions to the topics so that we can layer the learning. If we
introduce some of these concepts in CS 1 classes then when they get to
the theory class it won&amp;#39;t be the students first rodeo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve had success with this when teaching recursion early. I&amp;#39;ve also
done it with other concepts. When we teach the Towers of Hanoi, yes,
it&amp;#39;s a nice recursion problem but really it&amp;#39;s to get the students
thinking about run time and a bit of proof. likewise, when we do a
maze solver in NetLogo we&amp;#39;re alluding to dynamic programming, search,
and path finding.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t have too much more to say on this topic right now. I&amp;#39;m not
enough of a theory guy to sensibly design these experiences. The good
news is that MacCormick has written an soon to be released &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/What-Can-Computed-Practical-Computation/dp/0691170665/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; on the subject. I
signed up for a reviewer copy at SIGCSE and look forward to receiving
a copy. Once I do I hope to be able to find some gems that I can work
into CS 1 experiences.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How my views on education research were shaped</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/practitioners-and-researchers/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/practitioners-and-researchers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
After reading a couple of comments on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse2018-code-tracing/&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; where I talked a
bit about practitioners vs researchers I thought I&amp;#39;d expand and
expound a bit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While there are education researchers that I very much respect,
overall, I&amp;#39;m skeptical of education research. Note
that I&amp;#39;m not talking specifically about CS Ed research but rather
education research in general.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s go back to the beginning. I entered teaching from
industry. Goldman Sachs to be specific. I started in a shortage area -
math and barely had the credentials to do so. The transcript evaluator
at the DOE counted my Algorithms and Numerical Methods courses as Math
courses to get me over the credit hump.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I had zero ed courses under my belt and was thrown into the
fire. Fortunately, I landed in a school, Seward Park High School, with
a very supportive faculty. I wouldn&amp;#39;t have survived my first year
without Mike G, Bruce B, Jonathan G, and many others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then, I had to start taking education credits to make my license
permanent. Some classes were taught by professors some by
adjuncts. The adjuncts were invariably experienced teachers and the
professors were research faculty. In many classes, I had to read the
latest research.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I found that what &amp;#34;the research&amp;#34; told us to do was contrary to what
some of the best teachers did in practice. I kept hearing about the
&amp;#34;right&amp;#34; way to teach but it frequently didn&amp;#39;t jive with reality. When
the true way worked, circumstances were right and the technique
aligned with the teacher&amp;#39;s natural tendencies. When it didn&amp;#39;t, why
not? Many reasons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
lack of prep time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
too many students (per class, per day, per term)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
different populations than the one researched
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
factors the researcher didn&amp;#39;t include (and there are tons of them)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
teachers with different personalities and skill sets
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and each of the above points opens up to scores of specifics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This theme continued throughout my career. I&amp;#39;d ask teachers in other
subject areas about the current state of the art research. What was
the current trends in their fields. Generally the best teachers would
summarize what was going on and then either say that it didn&amp;#39;t work
for them or that if it did, they didn&amp;#39;t take it seriously because in
five or ten years &amp;#34;the research&amp;#34; would tell them to do something
different and then they would all of a sudden be bad teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was another point. The right way to do it has changed over and
over during my career.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then there&amp;#39;s the reproducibility problem. Apparently it&amp;#39;s pretty bad
in education research. I mentioned in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse2018-code-tracing&#34;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; that when a
researched does it once on a small group it&amp;#39;s research but when a
teacher did it over and over it&amp;#39;s an anecdote.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I was young I would listen to a master teacher tell me about how
he set up some experience - the one I&amp;#39;m remembering now is an
experiential / discovery lesson on triangle geometry. He&amp;#39;d talk about
all the hard work that went into prepping his class for this type of
lesson as well as the prep time for the lesson itself. He told me how
he did it four years ago and it was great but then the year after it
fell flat and how he changed it for the next year. How it worked in
third period but not seventh and why he thought it played out the way
it did. That&amp;#39;s a lot more reproduction than most &amp;#39;research&amp;#39; actually
gets and this is what a master teacher does all the time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, I got tired of hearing how to do it by people who don&amp;#39;t
actually have to. If you&amp;#39;re going to talk the talk, you should walk
the walk. As a side, this problem is really bad with &amp;#34;thought leaders.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All this sounds like I&amp;#39;m really down on education research or at least
the overarching system. I probably am but there are many education
researchers doing great work and I respect them immensely.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They know they don&amp;#39;t have a magic bullet:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is what I tried with this population at this time and this is
what happened. You might want to try it or a variation on it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s a far cry from &amp;#34;here&amp;#39;s how to teach&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The researchers who acknowledge that their experience as college
researchers or even teaching faculty are different from a k12 teacher
and that no matter how hard they try to work out all the variables
they can only ever account for a tiny fraction of them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The key is that they&amp;#39;re adding another drop into the bucket of
knowledge. Over time it adds up. I have great respect for everyone
doing this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These researchers have to keep prodding us teachers to re-evaluate our
practice and then either take or incorporate the research or reject it
after determining if it would be good or not for our population. At
the same time, it&amp;#39;s up to practitioners to keep pushing back against
magic bullet research and the one true way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We all have a role to play in this game.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fixing the Absent Teacher Reserve (ATR) situation</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/atrs/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/atrs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In the New York City department of education a recurring hot topic is
the Absent Teacher Reserve or ATR pool.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A teacher or administrator in the ATR pool is a licensed, most likely
tenured teacher not assigned permanently to a school. Each year these
educators get shuttled from school to school and denied a chance to
actually settle in a position.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The ATR pool was created under the Bloomberg administration. Prior to
that, when there was an opening school transfers were basically
seniority based and when school had too many teachers the least senior
was excessed or basically out of a job until a school with an opening
could be found. The Bloomberg plan allowed teachers to use criteria
other than seniority for transfers but so as not to violate the
contract agreed to by both parties, teachers who were excessed, as
they might not be least senior, were kept on as employees and put in
the pool.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
ATR&amp;#39;s would rotate from school to school. Sometimes for a couple of
week but more recently for a year at a time. When at a school for only
a couple of weeks they could only be used as subs or for grunt work
but even when there for a year they&amp;#39;re treated like second class
citizens.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The ATR pool grew in size when the Bloomberg/Klein DOE went on the war
path, set schools up to fail and closed them left and right. If you
had the bad luck being at a close out school when it closed then, hello
ATR pool.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over the years, the press, ed reformers and politicians have unfairly
bashed this group of educators. They&amp;#39;ve falsely claimed that these are
criminal teachers or unsatisfactory teachers. That&amp;#39;s a blatant
lie. Teachers up on charges are removed from schools and await a
hearing in another draconian process set up to violate teacher&amp;#39;s
rights. If a teacher is ultimately found guilty, they are disciplined
or fired. If exonerated, they&amp;#39;re returned to their schools. In any
case they&amp;#39;re not ATRs. Teachers that are repeatedly found to be
unsatisfactory are likewise removed (although the process here is
ridiculous and unfair as well).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
ATRs like any pool of teachers run the gamut. Some are great, some are
poor, many will fall in between. All are stigmatized and treated like
damaged goods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
People ask, how can a good teacher get into the ATR pool? As I said,
be at a closeout school. In the year before I was able to bring my friend
and former colleague JonAlf over to Stuy, he was at Brandeis High
School - a
closeout school. I tried to bring him over that year but his principal
wouldn&amp;#39;t release him. Had I not been successful in bringing him over
the following year he might very well have ended up in the ATR pool
and he&amp;#39;s one of the best teachers I know. What about the teacher that
doesn&amp;#39;t want to abandon those kids that the DOE abandoned when they
decided to close the school. That martyr teacher surely ends up in the
ATR pool but that&amp;#39;s the type of dedicated teacher every principal
should want.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So now we have a bunch of stigmatized teachers looking for work in a
system that won&amp;#39;t give them a chance. Not only due to them being
considered &amp;#34;damaged goods&amp;#34; but also because they&amp;#39;re expensive to
hire.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When a school gets an ATR to them, it&amp;#39;s free - the cost isn&amp;#39;t added to
their budget - they keep them as extra manpower for the year and then
throw them out with the trash. At times, they get some credit for
keeping them a second year and even beyond they can get rid of them
whenever they want. Great way to bust the contract.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A clear example of this is Stuy&amp;#39;s  current math chair. He&amp;#39;s an ATR
Assistant Principal. They got him for free for the first year and I
believe at a 50% discount for the second and even now they can dump
him whenever they want. This is rubbish – he&amp;#39;s either good enough for
the position or he&amp;#39;s not. If he is, he should be given the job for
real and if he isn&amp;#39;t then what is he still doing there. I&amp;#39;m not making
any value judgment on him or the department but it&amp;#39;s either one or the
other.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, a big reason for this ATR mess is about budgets and money. The
problem is that it&amp;#39;s a big lie.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The DOE pretends the we have a situation like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/atr1.png&#34; alt=&#34;/img/atr1.png&#34; title=&#34;/img/atr1.png&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; height=&#34;250&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The DOE has money and schools have money. The schools pay for their
teachers, supplies, and everything else but the ATRS are paid for by
the DOE. Of course this isn&amp;#39;t the case. The truth is that the DOE pays
for everything:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/atr2.png&#34; alt=&#34;/img/atr2.png&#34; title=&#34;/img/atr2.png&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; height=&#34;250&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
ALL the money comes from the DOE.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the past the DOE has come up with poorly conceived and poorly
received plans on how to deal with the ATR situation but it&amp;#39;s really
quite simple.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Start by recognizing that ALL the money comes from the DOE. Once you
do that you can address the problem:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Assign the ATR to a school
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the school likes the ATR and the ATR likes the school, they keep
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
them and the DOE picks up the tab or rather adjusts the schools
budget to compensate. The DOE will continue to do so until a real
opening occurs at the school in the ATR&amp;#39;s area at which point the
ATR fills the position officially and the budget is readjusted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the school or ATR don&amp;#39;t like each other the ATR gets rotated,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
however you create a 3 strikes (or maybe 2 or 4 or some number)
rule.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the school keeps sending away ATRs semester after semester hit
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
them with a penalty or force an ATR placement when they have an
opening (assuming the ATR is amenable).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the ATR keeps declining positions after a set number of
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
schools force the placement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s it. Simple and solves the problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New York State moving forward with CS Teacher Certification</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ny-cs-certificate/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ny-cs-certificate/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Last April I woke up early and trekked up to Albany along with a few
of my Hunter College colleagues to share our thoughts on K12 Computer
Science teacher certification with the Board of Regents. We gave a
presentation to the Regents Higher Education Committee and afterwards
had a chance to talk with some of the Regents as well as other members
of the New York State Department of Education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I left feeling that our proposals were well received and I think
everyone present - both the Hunter and NYSED contingents hoped that
things would move forward on this important issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fast forward to today, December 8, 2017. I was up at the crack
of dawn. Driving in the dark in the snow from NYC to Albany to once
again attend a Board of Regents Higher Education Committee
meeting. This time, the agenda item was:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Proposed Amendments to Part 30 of the Regents Rules and Section 52.21
and Part 80 the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education Relating
to a New Certification Area and Tenure Area for Computer Science
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No discussion or debate this time around just the proposal. If I
understand the process correctly, this should come up again at the
March meeting at which point it will be voted on. If approved, it
looks like we&amp;#39;ll have a pathway towards certification for CS teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven&amp;#39;t had a chance to dive into the details but at the meeting a
few key points came up:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As the proposal indicates this will be a subject area in which a
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
teacher can be certified and be awarded tenure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There will be a traditional pathway for new teachers - Bachelors /
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Masters degree
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There will be an alternative pathway for people entering from the
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
workforce
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There will be an extension for teachers with another license so they
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
won&amp;#39;t have to give up tenure in their current license.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There will be an &amp;#34;individual evaluation&amp;#34; pathway which sounds to me
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
like it could catch people who fall through the cracks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There looks to be a sensible ramp up period - until September 2022
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s a grandfathering provision that looks to last 10 years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This sounds like a smart sensible plan. Multiple pathways, shallow
ramp up and provisions to protect existing teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, the devil is in the details. What&amp;#39;s an approved program?
Can a grandfathered teacher teach all CS classes or just intro ones?
etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I said, I haven&amp;#39;t had a chance to dive into the details yet but
this is very exciting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Prior to the meeting I was chatting with a few other people
attending. One, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uft.org/&#34;&gt;UFT&lt;/a&gt; representative was very excited about the
prospect. Another contingent, a group from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nysut.org/&#34;&gt;NYSUT&lt;/a&gt; was very much against
a new certification area. Their position was that this would create a
teacher shortage because no one would have a CS license and no one
would get one due to the difference in salary between teaching and the
tech industry. I&amp;#39;ve already written on how I feel that this is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/will-we-lose-cs-teachers-to-industry&#34;&gt;red
herring&lt;/a&gt;. What shocked me though was their feeling that &amp;#34;we already
have many non-CS teachers effectively teaching CS across the
state. They&amp;#39;re doing a great job and don&amp;#39;t need any additional content
or pedagogical knowledge.&amp;#34; I think they&amp;#39;re wrong and I also think that
when we as a community talk about how our summer professional
development is all that&amp;#39;s needed, we undercut CS education and
the teaching profession as a whole.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event this was a big step for New York. I tried to individually
thank as many of the participants as I could for helping shepherd this
along but could only speak to a few so I&amp;#39;ll just give a blanket thank
you here to the NY State Board of Regents, Board of Education and
State Education department.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Professional Development beyond Scratch</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/election-day-pd-2017/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/election-day-pd-2017/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Today was Election Day. One of the few days each year when students
stay home and teachers spend all day attending what is generously
known as professional development.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Years ago I was in a room with a few colleagues when my friend Dave -
one of the best math teachers I know said &amp;#34;you know, every time we
have a PD day in NJ and my wife and I have to scramble to take care of
the kids I get a little annoyed but then think I shouldn&amp;#39;t get annoyed
since they&amp;#39;re spending the day doing all sorts of valuable PD.&amp;#34; He
then said &amp;#34;but then I realize that their PD is probably about as
useful as our PD and I get really angry.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There you have it. This is not to say that there is no good PD but it
seems that the professional development opportunities provided by our
schools have over the years ranged from useless to insulting with
maybe a small bright spot here and there. Historically it&amp;#39;s been worse
for CS teachers because we get lumped in with math teachers and have
to spend the day learning about tools and techniques we&amp;#39;ll never use
or discussing curricula we never teach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, when I spoke to JonAlf about rescuing the Stuy teachers for the
day and hosting them at Hunter, he and the other CS teachers were
pretty excited. It wasn&amp;#39;t as though I had the magic PD answer but I
was going to provide a space and we&amp;#39;d figure out together what would
be productive and valuable for them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As it turns out, I&amp;#39;ve been spending a good amount of time these past
few weeks visiting high schools to talk about Hunter CS and when I was
at Bronx Science the topic of Election Day PD came up and I thought
that it would be nice to get the Bronx Science and Stuy teachers
together. After thinking about it more, I recalled that there were few
good PD opportunities for CS teachers who taught advanced classes as
opposed to all the CS PD floating around these days at more of a
beginner level.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I thought that we could change this. In the end, I hosted PD today and
had teachers from Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, Brooklyn Tech, and the
Manhattan Hunter Science High School in attendance. I invited teachers
from a few more schools but in the end we had those four schools and
seventeen teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The original agenda was:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
09:00 - 10:00 : Each school describes it&amp;#39;s program and courses
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
10:00 - 11:00 : An intro to Git and GitHub for the classroom
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
10:00 - 11:45 : Sharing neat lessons
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
11:45 - 12:00 : Presentation by &lt;a href=&#34;http://chicktech.org&#34;&gt;ChickTech&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
12:00 - 01:00 : Lunch
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
01:00 - End   : Small group lesson and curriculum work
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Oh boy did I mess up on the timing. The description and
discussion of school programs took all morning. It was interesting to
hear how each school&amp;#39;s program evolved and how they fit into the
school&amp;#39;s culture. Brooklyn Tech, for instance is a school where
students declare majors. This has a big impact on what classes kids
have to take and are able to take. This is very different from Stuy or
Science where kids programs are more open ended or MHSHS which is a
much smaller school and has restrictions related to size. It was also
interesting to note Brooklyn Tech&amp;#39;s decision to have every student
take APCS-P. Interesting because Brooklyn Tech is one of the country&amp;#39;s
largest high schools and most of them should have done well on the
exam. That gave NYC around 1,400 passing AP scores in one shot. On
the other hand none of the other schools present today offered APCS-P
but did have their own intro CS class that students took prior to
APCS-A.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We finished the morning with a visit by Heather from
&lt;a href=&#34;http://chicktech.org&#34;&gt;ChickTech&lt;/a&gt;. ChickTech is a non-profit dedicated to retaining women in
Tech. It works with both girls in K12 and also those in industry. My
hope was to get a conversation started and see if there were some
potential avenues of partnership between the organization and the
schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After lunch, the group decided that we should do the Git/GitHub
workshop and JonAlf obliged.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Overall I think the day was a success.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My hope is that today&amp;#39;s attendees can form a core group of CS teachers
who teach more advanced courses and we can form something of a support
group for each other.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I plan to try to facilitate future meetings and hopefully we&amp;#39;ll be
able to attract more teachers to our group.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All in all I&amp;#39;m very happy with how the day went.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>There&#39;s always something to learn (from your students)</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/when-they-change-the-script/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/when-they-change-the-script/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
One thing I&amp;#39;ve learned from teaching is that there&amp;#39;s always something
new to learn. For the kids, yes, but I&amp;#39;m talking about for the
teacher.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other day, I taught a lesson I&amp;#39;ve taught many times. Find the mode
of a data set. That&amp;#39;s the problem that they solve but the lesson is
really about run time complexity, hidden complexity and using data
structures in alternate ways.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I blogged about this &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-03-23-Who_won_the_election-Quadratic_to_Linear_Time.md&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; so you can get an earlier take there
although the code isn&amp;#39;t formatted correctly due to blog conversions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As with the last time, the students  had already written code to find
the largest value in a list and also to find the frequency of an item
in a list.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-python&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They had to write mode prior to the class. In the past, students would
generally come up with something like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-python&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They&amp;#39;d use their existing knowledge and the &amp;#39;find the largest&amp;#39; idiom
to find the mode by:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
find the frequency of the first item and assume it&amp;#39;s the mode so far
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
for each item in the list
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
find the frequency of that idem
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
if it occurs more than the mode so far then it becomes the new
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
mode so far
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s a lot of good in this solution. The kids incrementally develop
a solution, they use and exctend code and concepts they already know
and understand and it&amp;#39;s clear and understandable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We would then run the code on larger and larger data sets and notice
that it gets slow pretty quickly. This leads to an informal discussion
of run time and the fact that there&amp;#39;s hidden complexity – the call to
&lt;code&gt;freq&lt;/code&gt; in the main loop introduces a linear component so we have a
loop within a loop and an N^2 routine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The big takeaway is get a feel for run time and to be aware of hidden
complexity. We then move to a linear solution by using a list as
buckets. You can read more about that in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-03-23-Who_won_the_election-Quadratic_to_Linear_Time.md&#34;&gt;original post&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What was interesting this time around was that most of the kids came
up with a solution more like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-python&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Instead of calculating the frequency inside the loop they made a list
of frequencies. &lt;code&gt;freq[0]&lt;/code&gt; had the frequency of &lt;code&gt;l[0]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;freq[1]&lt;/code&gt; the
frequency of &lt;code&gt;l[1]&lt;/code&gt; etc. They then loop through that &lt;code&gt;freq&lt;/code&gt; list to
find the largest element and that&amp;#39;s the index of the mode value in the
original list.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s functionally the same as the first solution but in some ways it&amp;#39;s
very different. They built the data set they needed ahead of time
instead of calculating the data on the fly and they used the concept
of parallel lists.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like the solution and it didn&amp;#39;t prevent us from getting to the run
time stuff but this did give me something to think about.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why did this class led them largely to a different solution than the
classes I&amp;#39;ve taught in the class. There are a lot of things to ponder
since it&amp;#39;s a college class that meets twice a week with kids from a
range of backgrounds (CS and otherwise) vs a high school class that
meets 5 days a week and the kids all had the same in class experience
prior to this lesson. Did I do something differently before hand? Some
assignments? Something I modeled?  I&amp;#39;m not sure but it&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;m
going to ponder.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It will interesting to see if this was a one shot deal and my current
class will solve problems as I predict moving forward or if I&amp;#39;m going
to get to see a lot of new things.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A test result is just a test result</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ap-results-measure-of-curriculum/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ap-results-measure-of-curriculum/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
This past weekend was &lt;a href=&#34;http://catskillsconf.com&#34;&gt;Catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt; - my favorite event of the
year. I spent the weekend up in Ulster County with a bunch of my
students. some great friends old and new, and Devorah. It was a great
weekend but I was mostly offline.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a result I missed a rather heated discussion in the CS Ed Facebook
groups. The debate was over whether or not Strong AP CSP exam results
are indicative of a good curriculum or good professional development (PD).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
TL;DR - NO!!!!!
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Further, anyone who thinks that a set of exam results can tell you
that a particular PD sequence or curriculum is good shouldn&amp;#39;t be
allowed to call themselves a teacher and I don&amp;#39;t want them anywhere
near my kids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I guess that language is strong, even for me but it&amp;#39;s true.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tests are designed to assess students and many tests don&amp;#39;t even do
that well. They shouldn&amp;#39;t be used to measure something further
removed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The last time this idea made its rounds was using student test results
for teacher evaluation. They do that in NY. A judge called the
practice &amp;#34;capricious&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;arbitrary.&amp;#34; My friend and former
colleague Gary Rubinstein showed a year or so ago that standardized
test scores varied enough from year to year so as to make the ratings
useless [fn::sorry, I just got back from the weekend trip and am too tired
to find the link. You can go to his site and search and while you&amp;#39;re
there, there&amp;#39;s lots of good stuff to read.]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using test scores to say a PD sequence is good? What if that PD
focused on test prep? What if it did nothing in particular? When I was
at Stuy and when I was at Seward Park the Calc teachers&amp;#39; students had
great AP results. I can tell you that none of those teachers had any
quality PD specific to AP Calc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Curriculum? My mentor and friend Danny Jaye told me many times - &amp;#34;A
great teacher can save a class from a  horrible curriculum but a great
curriculum will do nothing for a class with a horrible teacher.&amp;#34; He
was right. Again, what if the curriculum encourages test prep. What if
pressure on the teacher encourages them to focus on test prep
regardless of curriculum or PD (see my recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/standards-who-for&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An AP test measures one thing - how well the student did on the AP
test. There are so many variables that go into a class:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is it first period at 8:00am?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is it the last class of the day?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is it before lunch or right afterwards?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about right after Gym.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What&amp;#39;s the mix of students - every class is different
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is the teacher teaching the subject once a day? Two times? Five
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
times?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How large is the class
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How many other classes are the kids taking?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The list goes on and on. There are so many contributing factors that
you just can&amp;#39;t say &amp;#34;Good test results = good curriculum&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;good test
results = good PD.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Want to know if a curriculum is good - have experienced teachers who
know their subject run it a few times through and ask them. Same for
PD.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teachers know education a lot better than test makers, curriculum
developers and PD providers. How about listening to them for a change?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I Believe CS Teachers are Smart and Capable</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-teachers-smart/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-teachers-smart/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
People sometimes accuse me of being an elitist CS snob that I feel that CS
teachers have to have advanced CS degrees.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s not that at all. Rather, I feel that CS teachers are smart and
capable. Circumstances frequently result in a teacher in front of a CS
class with limited content and pedagogical content knowledge. It&amp;#39;s not
ideal but it&amp;#39;s reality. Of course I feel that we should do everything
to support and encourage these teachers but we should also insist that
after a reasonable period of time, they know their stuff.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is why I hate it when I hear people in the CS Ed community say
something is too hard. Git&amp;#39;s too hard. The command line is too
hard. Functional programming&amp;#39;s too hard [fn::whether or not any of
these topics are appropriate for a particular course is discussion for
another time]. That&amp;#39;s all nonsense. At last
year&amp;#39;s SIGCSE conference people from a state, I forget which, was
considering not using the Praxis exam for CS teacher certification
even though the state uses the Praxis exam for other subject
areas. They claimed that the praxis was too hard for CS teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/praxis.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/praxis.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/praxis.jpg&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven&amp;#39;t taken the Praxis exam but some friends have. It doesn&amp;#39;t
appear to be unreasonable at all[fn::although I&amp;#39;m not a big believer
in standardized exams for certification or in general.].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I can certainly understand a teacher not knowing much when they
start - thrown in due to necessity I think it&amp;#39;s ridiculous not to
insist that they ultimately get to real mastery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A math teacher generally has to know math beyond calculus. Science
teachers have to have gotten through Orgo. English teachers have to
understand Joyce. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THIS IS HARD STUFF!!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;[fn::There are plenty of
lousy teacher prep programs that don&amp;#39;t ensure teachers learn the
subject matter they should but the good ones do.]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think it&amp;#39;s insulting to say that CS teachers aren&amp;#39;t capable of doing
the same in their subject area.
&amp;#39;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is the new Secret Sauce ever better?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/is-the-new-secret-sauce-ever-better/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/is-the-new-secret-sauce-ever-better/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I read &lt;a href=&#34;http://nancyebailey.com/2017/09/05/xq-super-schools-business-working-to-end-public-high-schools/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; piece earlier today on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/NancyEBailey1&#34;&gt;Nancy Bailey&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s blog.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
TL;DR (although it really isn&amp;#39;t too long so you should read it) - it&amp;#39;s
on Laurene Powell Jobs, her efforts to &amp;#34;reform&amp;#34; education and why
she&amp;#39;s misguided as are most of the well to do non-educators working
hard to change and in many cases privatize public education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Laura posts a nice list of simple, common sense ways to improve
education. I&amp;#39;ll repost them here:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For years, research has shown that high school students need more sleep. They should have later start times. .
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Smaller class sizes would help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Make sure teachers don’t have so many preparation plans.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
End advanced placement classes (IMHO).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Improve career-technical classes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Provide rich extra-curricular activities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bring back life skill classes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Include a social justice curriculum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Include students on the disciplinary board.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Provide civics education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Make sure students get opportunities to participate in the arts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Work to include the community.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ensure students have access to counselors, and school support staff.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Every high school should have a great library, a real librarian, and technology and books.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looks very much like what those elite private schools that those rich
non-educators send their kids to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other day I also overheard a conversation between two
professors. One noted that they had just taught a course totally
online for the first time and that the professor really had fun doing
it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These got me thinking more about all the secret sauce and magic
bullets coming from tech to save education - things like MOOCS or  &amp;#34;personalized&amp;#34;
learning system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started to wonder - have these &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; been pushed on public
schools because they&amp;#39;re better or rather because they cut costs (or in
the slightly better case to reach a student that otherwise wouldn&amp;#39;t
have any opportunity which, in a way is generally cost related).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I couldn&amp;#39;t come up with a single instance. They&amp;#39;re always a way to
replace what I consider personalized instruction – you know, when a
teacher has a small class and can personally deal with, learn about,
interact with, and teach the child. Kids spend hours in front of a
screen instead of working with others. Kids do a MOOC (or maybe drop
out of a MOOC) so that you can have your student/teacher ratio reach
ridiculous levels. I&amp;#39;ve never seen any tech solution rolled out to
public schools because it&amp;#39;s better. Only to cut costs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How do I know that it&amp;#39;s not better? Well, we have Nancy&amp;#39;s list
above. It&amp;#39;s what those rich people pay all that money to the elite
private schools for.  If all these solutions the Jobs and Gates of the
world were so much better, wouldn&amp;#39;t they insist upon them  for their
own children?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just some Friday food for thought.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teaching APCS-A for the first time</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/teaching-ap-first-time/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/teaching-ap-first-time/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I got  an email from a friend the other day. Among other things, he
mentioned that he would be teaching APCS-A for the first time this
year. He&amp;#39;s a little trepidatious. He knows his stuff but he hasn&amp;#39;t
really done much using Java.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was going to respond in an email but thought I might share here
instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
TL;DR - for all you APCS teachers who are new or new to Java - learn
your core CS, lean on your resources and support and it&amp;#39;s OK to tell
your kids &amp;#34;I don&amp;#39;t know, I&amp;#39;ll get back to you.&amp;#34;. Don&amp;#39;t worry, you&amp;#39;ll be great.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first time I taught APCS was some time around 1991 or 1992. It was at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sewardparkhs.com/Famous-Alumni/&#34;&gt;Seward Park&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sewardparkhs.com/History/&#34;&gt;High School&lt;/a&gt;. It was the AB curriculum - that is one
semester of programming in Pascal and one semester of Data Structures
and Algorithms.  Being a computer science major the core material was
never a concern. I had taken APCS the first time it was offered in May
1984 in Pascal and while most of my college and pre-teaching professional work
was in C, my college started it&amp;#39;s CS sequence with Pascal. I was more
concerned with the actual teaching part. I had taught math for a year
and a half at that point but never CS and by any measure I was still
wet behind the ears. I never finished that first experience because I
was excessed to Stuy mid semester. I wasn&amp;#39;t particularly happy with my
performance but looking back, I think I did a pretty good job given
the situation and my experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After teaching math for a year and a half I was back in APCS at
Stuy. Still in Pascal. I spent the next few years figuring out how to
teach CS and APCS in particular along with starting a couple of new
classes. When the College Board decided to move the AP class to C++ I
was happy, sad and a little worried. Pascal had a bunch of limitations
but I had never used C++. True, I was a C programmer at heart but I
had never really done the OOP thing. I did, as it turned out, design a
number of my C systems in an Object Typed design: I would use a single
file per &amp;#34;class&amp;#34; where local variables were de facto instance
variables and functions in the file were methods and each file was a
singleton class. I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Analysis-Design-Applications-3rd/dp/020189551X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1503519770&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=Grady+Booch&#34;&gt;Booch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Software-Construction-Book-CD-ROM/dp/0136291554/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8&#34;&gt;Meyer&lt;/a&gt; on my own but I had no
schooling in OOP and no professional experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As it turned out, I didn&amp;#39;t have to worry. I knew my CS and while it
took me a while to become comfortable with OOP, the class, and of
course I knew this from the get go, started from nothing and built
up complexity a step at a time. The worst that might have happened is
that some of my solutions might have been more C-esque than C++.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The move to Java was a little more jarring. Now we had a totally new
language. I couldn&amp;#39;t fall back on C. It removed memory management and
explicit pointers and it had to be used in an Object Oriented
manner. I remember asking Mike Schidlowsky, a former student turned
friend who was the Java consultant on the Java edition of Sedgewick&amp;#39;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Robert-Sedgewick-Algorithms-Fundamentals-Structures/dp/B008VR3ZH4/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1503520269&amp;amp;sr=8-4&amp;amp;keywords=schidlowsky&#34;&gt;Algorithms&lt;/a&gt; book how to do something. It had to do with passing and
modifying arrays. In C there were a number of ways to accomplish what
I wanted to do. In Java, I couldn&amp;#39;t figure out how to do it the way I
wanted. My friend Mike told me &amp;#34;you just don&amp;#39;t do it that way in
Java.&amp;#34; Again, it turned out that I didn&amp;#39;t have to worry. The basic
coding was still the same as were the data structures and
algorithms. The only challenge was that I had to get into a Java OOP
mindset which it turned out wasn&amp;#39;t that hard.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I never really warmed up to OOP - I find other paradigms more
natural for me, I knew my CS and got more and more comfortable with
the Java (or C++) way of doing things as time wore on. Sometimes I
would say &amp;#34;I don&amp;#39;t know&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;let&amp;#39;s figure it out&amp;#34; but that&amp;#39;s OK.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Nowadays, there are many more resources available for CS teachers. If
you&amp;#39;re new, lean on them. Use the mailing lists, stackexchange,
facebook groups. Online resources like repl.it, codehs.com etc. Yes,
it&amp;#39;s true that you&amp;#39;ll be better next time around and even better years
down the road but right now, you&amp;#39;re probably better than you think.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A number of my former students volunteer for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tealsk12.org/&#34;&gt;TEALS&lt;/a&gt; - a really great
program that brings software engineers into the classroom to work with
non-CS teachers to deliver instruction. A number of my kids have
shared the following sentiment:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m really helping
the teacher to become self sufficient or if I&amp;#39;m a great teacher but I
do know one thing - while I&amp;#39;m there, the kids are getting a hell of a
lot more than if I wasn&amp;#39;t there.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
– Remember that as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Cost of AP Exams</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cost-of-ap-exams/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cost-of-ap-exams/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Now that I&amp;#39;m back from vacation and summer&amp;#39;s winding down I thought
I&amp;#39;d start getting back to more classroom related posts. I still have a
few summer topics I want to write about – standards and side projects
in particular but I&amp;#39;m also looking forward to talking more about the
classroom since, after all, at my core, I&amp;#39;m a teacher. When I saw &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2017/08/how_online_textbooks_could_help_more_students_take_ap_exams.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;
article in my inbox this morning I thought I&amp;#39;d talk about it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the piece, Lindsey Tepe since more kids are taking AP classes and
they&amp;#39;re very expensive, schools should look to lower other costs
related to AP classes so as to provide financial support so that
students can take that oh so important end of year exam:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While the College Board continues to reimburse about one-third of the
test cost for eligible low-income students, only about half of states
are now offering any further financial assistance for students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ms. Tepe&amp;#39;s solution? Lower text book costs. As a way of lowering
school costs, I&amp;#39;m all for it. I&amp;#39;ve used free online resources in lieu
of textbooks for years but the savings should go somewhere where it
can make a difference. Perhaps lowering class sizes. The fatal flaw in
Ms. Teps&amp;#39;s piece is that it continues spinning the misplaced narrative
that AP Exams are a very important part of a child&amp;#39;s education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s be reminded of something: The AP Exam is one thing - an exam - a
single test at the end of the year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The narrative is that students should take more and more AP classes,
that they&amp;#39;re somehow better for kids. Part of this is due to the
potential college credit and part is because the public has been
bamboozled by the ridiculous school ratings that give credit for AP
classes taken. Back in &amp;#34;the day,&amp;#34; AP classes were basically early
college. You could then argue that they were the most rigorous classes
offered in a school. AP Calc was basically college Calc. Same for
APCS-AB, AP-Bio and the rest. Now, with classes like APCS-P aimed to
be accessible to typical high school students in the lower grades,
they can&amp;#39;t (but still will) make that claim. In fact, at Stuy, my
former school, there are plenty of non AP classes that are more
rigorous than AP classes and the best AP teachers don&amp;#39;t always cover
the whole syllabus because they&amp;#39;re more concerned with their students
actually learning rather than scoring 5 on an exam.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the college credit front, if a student has a high probability of
saving money through AP credit then I&amp;#39;m all for it but otherwise, it&amp;#39;s
just money going to the college board.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It seems ridiculous for me to have to write this but the important
part of a class is, you know, the class. Not the single exam given by
an outside agency at the end and graded after the semester concludes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My suggestion? Offer college level work to students that are ready for
it but don&amp;#39;t push the AP exam. This would save a ton of money. What value
does the college board actually bring to the table? Remember, they&amp;#39;re
making a pretty penny on all of this testing. A math teacher should be
able to teach calculus with or without AP. A good text being used by
that teacher in class - be it free or paid for is actually much more
important to a student learning calculus than a single exam taken at
the end of the year. I&amp;#39;d go further and say that I&amp;#39;d trust the
teacher&amp;#39;s exam more than the college board&amp;#39;s. If a teacher knows the
math but needs to see some sample syllabi, they&amp;#39;re a web search
way. The same is true for most other college courses that have AP
equivalents and maybe even more so for computer science.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the day it should be about students learning not about
students taking high stakes exams.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ethics, Cybersecurity, ethics, curricula  and standards</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ethics-cybersecurity-curricla-standards/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ethics-cybersecurity-curricla-standards/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This morning, I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alfredtwo&#34;&gt;Alfred Thompson&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s post on &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/08/cybersecuritythis-summers-computer.html&#34;&gt;teaching
cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt;. as Alfred says, it&amp;#39;s something of a CS Ed buzzword this
summer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another hot topic in K12 CS Ed this summer is the inclusion of ethics
in our CS courses courtesy of efforts like the #ethicalCS twitter chat every
Wednesday at 8:00 Eastern time  hosted by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ed_saber&#34;&gt;Saber Khan&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Discussions about both topics include &amp;#34;where should we be doing this?&amp;#34;
&amp;#34;What should we be doing?&amp;#34; and of course &amp;#34;How?&amp;#34; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This got me thinking about designing curriculum from the top down -
that is, as dictated by outside forces: principals, superintendents,
states, industry or bottom up: a teacher sees a need and designs
something for their students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The best classes I&amp;#39;ve seen are those designed by a passionate teacher
from the ground up. I met  &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dougbergmanUSA&#34;&gt;Doug Bergman&lt;/a&gt; at this past year&amp;#39;s CSTA conference. He&amp;#39;s terrific. I
think he came to the conference wanting to find out more about what
cybersecurity really meant. By the second day, he was raving about all
the amazing possibilities. I&amp;#39;d love to be in the class he develops.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, when topics or standards are forced down from
above, I&amp;#39;ve seen something entirely different.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve observed and been involved in cybersecurity discussions  with CS
teachers. The discussion goes something like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Well, we do memory allocation in course XYZ so we can give a
homework assignment there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We can rewrite the story (theme) for the assignment in our data
structures class.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We already do a crypto assignment in algorithms so we&amp;#39;re already
doing it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve seen the same with groups of math teachers discussing
implementing common core. They talk about resequencing topics,
rewriting a few word problems or homework assignments but at the core,
the feeling is &amp;#34;we already know how to teach math.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It gets worse when there&amp;#39;s a standardized or high stakes test at the
end of the tunnel and you get the &amp;#34;you need this for the test&amp;#34; type
units.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This might not be as big of a problem in K12 CS right now because so many
teachers are just learning their craft but in established fields such
as math or college CS, when an edict comes from above telling a
teacher how to teach, unless the teacher really believes in it, the
teacher will only pay lip service to it. If it isn&amp;#39;t an issue in CS Ed
right now, it will eventually become one as our field develops legs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is arguably a bigger issue with Ethical CS than cybersecurity. If
the teacher doesn&amp;#39;t really believe it&amp;#39;s an important topic, we&amp;#39;ll get
lip service at best and in the case of ethics, unless the teacher
really believes it and models it, the students will be able to tell
that it&amp;#39;s a show.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t have an answer other than what my friend and mentor Herb
Greenhut told me many years ago &amp;#34;Solving the education problem is
easy. Hire good teachers and get the f*ck out of the way.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Back in May, I read this &lt;a href=&#34;http://avc.com/2017/05/grit/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about Angela Duckworth and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Grit-Passion-Perseverance-Angela-Duckworth-ebook/dp/B010MH9V3W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1501543669&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=Grit&#34;&gt;Grit&lt;/a&gt;. Grit
has become an education buzzword in the past few years so I figured I
should read Duckworth&amp;#39;s book. It took this long because there was a
long waiting list at the New York Public Library to get the ebook. I&amp;#39;m
still not quite finished with the book but I thought I&amp;#39;d share some of
my thoughts on the book and the buzz.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first big takeaway is &amp;#34;you can get much further with a kind word
and a gun than with a kind word alone.&amp;#34; Or in grit terms Duckworth
says a number of times that Grit is important but that other factors
such as talent do indeed come into play and towards the end of the
book she lists other character qualities that are arguably more
important than grit. I&amp;#39;ll get back to grit + other qualities towards
the end of this post.  On the buzz side, all of that&amp;#39;s forgotten - in
the ed reform world it&amp;#39;s all grit all the time. We must teach it at
our low income schools and we should include grit in our evaluation of
teachers and schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Duckworth recently has come out to say grit shouldn&amp;#39;t be used in
evaluating schools and teachers but as I mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/outside-influences-on-cs-ed/&#34;&gt;a few days ago&lt;/a&gt;,
ed reformers have ways of taking arguably good ideas and using them towards
awful ends.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So we have a basic premise that hard work and sticktoitiveness is
important but so is talent. Talent alone won&amp;#39;t get you as far as
talent and grit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So in spite of the &amp;#34;ed reformers&amp;#34; take on grit, given Duckworth&amp;#39;s
balanced perspective, I was hooked.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Where Duckworth started to lose me, however is when she dove into the
education landscape for examples.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First up is Teach for America. Certainly the founder, Wendy Kopp is
full of grit and Duckworth talks about teachers needing to be gritty
but when you talk about TFA, you&amp;#39;re talking about a group that:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
has a 5 week training program - not nearly enough to learn to teach
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
has a 2 year commitment before moving to &amp;#34;better things&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
encourages practices like scripted lessons
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
None of this sounds particularly gritty to me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Duckworth also highlights the KIPP charter chain as an terrific
example of grit and the success that follows. She touts KIPP&amp;#39;s
graduation rate neglecting to mention that like most other charters
claiming miracles, KIPP&amp;#39;s stats should be eyed with scrutiny (&lt;a href=&#34;http://garyrubinstein.teachforus.org/2011/07/08/kipp-on-trickin-looking-at-the-raw-data/&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://garyrubinstein.wordpress.com/2016/01/22/whatever-happened-to-kipp/%0A&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://garyrubinstein.wordpress.com/2017/04/28/4th-best-high-school-in-new-york-is-a-kipp-school-that-doesnt-exist/&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). I would have expected a researcher to dig a little deeper.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My friend, former colleague, and TFA alum Gary Rubinstein visited a
KIPP school in NY a few years ago. His take:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So what I saw there was not very impressive.  I didn’t see any classes
where teachers were getting that mythical period and half of growth in
one period.  I saw some good teaching, mostly average teaching, and
even some very bad teaching.  I saw a novice teacher struggle to
control a class of nine students.  They were walking all over him and
accomplished very little that period.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And in terms of KIPP&amp;#39;s grit training:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also saw the ‘grit’ training program which amounted to the students
getting the teacher to define very clearly how little homework they
would have to do to still get their candy bar rewards.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, Duckworth holds up Geoffrey Canada&amp;#39;s as another shiny example
failing to notice that again, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://garyrubinstein.teachforus.org/2013/05/12/canadas-legend-ary-ted-talk-lie/&#34;&gt;Emperor has no clothes&lt;/a&gt; and if you
look at attrition, the results are far from stellar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of this left me thinking that if Duckworth was so off base with
these three example where I have some details of the behind the scenes
going on, how much can I trust the rest of the book?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In spite of this, I still agreed with Duckworth&amp;#39;s basic premise so I
read on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Later in the book, Duckworth talks about developing grit. This quote struck me:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Like a lot of parents I had a strong intuition that grit is enahnced
by doing activities like ballet… or piano … or football…
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It struck me because it seemed funny coming from a researcher. It
reminded me of Christopher Alexander&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;A Timeless Way of Building,&amp;#34; a
book on architecture that is sometimes credit as the root source for
Object Oriented Programming. Alexander talks about how societies
throughout history and throughout the world &amp;#34;knew&amp;#34; how to build
certain structures – barns, homes with certain features, even
towns. Back in the day we didn&amp;#39;t have engineering and architecture
schools but we figured out how to do these things and we figured it
out pretty much universally. Duckworth is basically saying &amp;#34;parents
know.&amp;#34; It reminded me of my belief - &amp;#34;teachers know.&amp;#34; This applies to
teaching content and teaching skills like grit. You can&amp;#39;t script a
grit lesson. A good teacher knows when a student needs encouragement,
when a student needs to be coddled and when a student needs to be
redirected.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This post has been something of a ramble but I want to get back to
grit and other qualities and how people are talking about grit as the
be all and end all and not just a component.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over on &lt;a href=&#34;http://avc.com&#34;&gt;AVC&lt;/a&gt;, in the post that got me to read Grit, Fred closed with:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you hire and manage people, if you run start and run companies, if
you invest in people and their projects, then Grit is a book you
should read.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He&amp;#39;s absolutely right but remember the whole person and what you&amp;#39;ve
prescreened for before you consider grit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Way back when discussions were ongoing about the design for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.afsenyc.org/&#34;&gt;AFSE&lt;/a&gt; -
before the DOE stopped returning my emails and froze me out of the
process I was at am meeting. A bunch of tech industry heavy hitters
were there. We were arguing over admission screening - did the school
need one. My position was that if you wanted to produce &amp;#34;Google ready&amp;#34;
engineers after high school you needed one. If that wasn&amp;#39;t the goal
you didn&amp;#39;t. One of the DOE representatives posed a question to the
tech people: &amp;#34;what qualities do you look for in a hire?&amp;#34; This elicited
responses like hard working, able to work with others, able to
communicate. The DOE person was proud to have made his point that
these tech companies weren&amp;#39;t looking for talent, advanced skills
anything similar - grit was all you needed. I followed up - &amp;#34;and from
what schools do you look for the kids with these qualities?&amp;#34; - MIT,
Harvard, Cornell… and the tech people got it - they were already
screening for the academic stuff so all that was left to look for were
the other skills.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Should we look at grit? Certainly. Just remember that it&amp;#39;s a piece of
the puzzle just like everything else.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thoughts on non educator  influences on CS Education</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/outside-influences-on-cs-ed/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/outside-influences-on-cs-ed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/guzdial&#34;&gt;Mark Guzdial&lt;/a&gt; blogged about a NY Times piece discussing
&lt;a href=&#34;https://computinged.wordpress.com/2017/07/28/silicon-valley-pushing-coding-into-american-classrooms-through-code-org-nytimes/&#34;&gt;Silicon Valleys influence on education through Code.org&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mark questioned the validity of the piece. If you don&amp;#39;t read Mark&amp;#39;s
blog and you&amp;#39;re in CS Ed you probably should.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tried to leave a comment on Mark&amp;#39;s blog - not about the NY Times
article but rather my thoughts on why I think it&amp;#39;s important that we
remain wary and vigilant to industry and outsiders influence and
impact on CS education and on education in general.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know if my comment is sitting waiting for Mark to moderate or
if I&amp;#39;m experiencing WordPress weirdness but since it hasn&amp;#39;t shown up
there, I thought I&amp;#39;d share it here:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While the article might not make a strong case it&amp;#39;s important to be wary of outside influences on education policies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m a fan of a lot of what code.org does but speaking about outsiders in general…
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bill Gates and Co. directly or indirecty gave us such delights like stack ranking teachers, improving, I mean evaluating, I mean firing teachers based on test scores of students they don&amp;#39;t teach, more and more high stakes nonsense testing for kids, and  at least in NY the destruction of neighborhood schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They&amp;#39;ve also pushed the current charter movement that, aided by misleading stats appear successful but in truth are no better and frequently worse than public schools while not sharing back a single &amp;#34;best practice.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then we have private companies like the College Board and Pearson both of whom have an outsized influence on US Ed policy and curriculum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t doubt the good intentions of code.org - as I said, I&amp;#39;m a fan. I am concerned when they and others take actions that can affect ed policy. I&amp;#39;m concerned when code.org representative pushes students to take an AP exam - not a great CS course with a great CS teacher but the actual exam. I&amp;#39;m even more concerned when code.org offers free PD when a school signs up for the PSAT8/9 - another high stakes meaningless test at taxpayer expense. For code.org it&amp;#39;s a means to  get more CS ed out there. To me it&amp;#39;s setting up a new cash cow for the college board at my expense and at students expense.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve seen many Ed Tech people, armed with the best intentions, enter the lions den – a school, district, or municipality only to see their best intentions corrupted in the name of cost cutting, profits, or politics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Three strikes and you&#39;re out or third time&#39;s a charm</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/three-times/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/three-times/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CompSci4All/with_replies?lang=en&#34;&gt;Brenda Wilkerson&lt;/a&gt;, Director of CS and IT education for Chicago public
schools was one of the keynote speakers at this year&amp;#39;s CSTA
conference.  During her talk, she made a comment about it taking three
times through to get it right so if you&amp;#39;re working hard and struggling
in your first year of teaching CS, it&amp;#39;s not the time to give
up. Learning to teach takes time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
She&amp;#39;s absolutely correct. I saw this in myself and I&amp;#39;ve seen this in
many other young teachers. First year through, your job is to
survive. This is when you rely on colleagues lesson plans, it you can
you shadow another teacher and in general do your best to give what
you can to your students while making it through the semester.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then, I often see something interesting. Year two is frequently a step
back. It was for me and I&amp;#39;ve seen this in many young teachers in many
subject areas. I&amp;#39;m guessing this happens because we feel we have a
year under our belt and then we overreach while trying to be
innovative and more effective.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In year three things start to improve again and then, if the teacher
continues to work at their craft, there&amp;#39;s steady progress for years to
come. At the point, the teachers seem to better understand how to
experiment and grow as a teacher in a safer way while also
understanding that it&amp;#39;s OK to have a bad day or even a bad unit -
there&amp;#39;s usually time to recover.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s also interesting that while this progression is most obvious in
new teachers it also seems to take place with experienced teachers
teaching new courses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All this means that teaching CS or any new subject takes time, effort,
and patience. It means young teachers shouldn&amp;#39;t beat themselves up and
that supervisors need to be supportive and give the time and resources
to allow teachers to succeed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It also means that schools with high teacher churn - notably charter
chains create environments that are anything but conducive to allowing
society to build a cadre of expert teachers. It works for these
charter chains because they&amp;#39;re exploiting the fact that they require a
small number of teachers as compared to large urban public schools so
can burn through teachers like gasoline and the fact that they&amp;#39;re
judged only by standardized tests. The model is not sustainable if
privatizers get their wish and charters become the national norm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, it&amp;#39;s another reason for people to wise up to &amp;#34;leadership&amp;#34;
programs like Teach for America where candidates come in for a couple
years before moving on to &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; opportunities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, if the third time&amp;#39;s a charm, how about the flip side? After how long
a period of time should we expect CS teachers to really know their
subject area? I&amp;#39;d say three years is also probably right. Year one,
the teacher is just surviving but after that, I&amp;#39;d expect a teacher to
want to master their subject. When I taught math early on in my
career, I felt overmatched. Particularly at Stuyvesant. I was a CS
major, not a math major. What did I do? I sat in on colleagues
classes and did self study over the summer. Of course by the time I
got up to speed, at least to my standards, I was teaching compute
science.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, if you&amp;#39;re a new CS teacher, why not take CS101 and data structures
over the summer instead of doing another scripted PD? Between local
and community colleges, at least in urban areas, this shouldn&amp;#39;t be
a problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, is third time a charm? Three strikes and you&amp;#39;re out? A bit of
both?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We have to give our new CS teachers the time and support to learn to
teach and to learn the subject area but at the same time, I think it&amp;#39;s
reasonable to require that they do so given the resources.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CS Ed advocates should pay attention to greater ed issues</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-ed-and-all-ed/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-ed-and-all-ed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
For anyone involved in K12 CS education, the past few years have been
a wild ride. When I first tried to make inroads in the DOE decades ago
I couldn&amp;#39;t get through the door. Now, CS Education is everyone&amp;#39;s
darling. It&amp;#39;s really amazing. It&amp;#39;s been a combination of grass roots
efforts by teachers, non profit education efforts such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://teals12k.org&#34;&gt;TEALS&lt;/a&gt;, advocacy of
groups like &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.org&#34;&gt;Code.org&lt;/a&gt; and amazing individuals like &lt;a href=&#34;http://avc.com/2017/06/bearing-witness/&#34;&gt;Fred Wilson&lt;/a&gt; who has
probably done more to move the needle of CS Ed in NY than any other 10
people combined.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While everyone agrees that to do CS education right at the K12 level
we need great teachers and lots of them, everyone also knows that
teachers voices are often unheard. The voices with the greatest weight
belong to the large non-profits, principals, superintendents and
local politicians.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today&amp;#39;s post is a plea to those with voices to think about the effects
of their advocacy for CS Ed to the greater education landscape.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started thinking about this recently as I&amp;#39;ve been developing the
CS teacher certification programs for Hunter College. As I spoke to
people across the nation I found that many of the efforts to
developing teacher certification are what I call the &amp;#34;you take it you
teach it&amp;#34; model. You take an abbreviated version of APCS-A and APCS-P
and you&amp;#39;re a certified CS teacher. Just about every real educator feels
that this is ludicrous. Some feel that this can be a first step - get
these credentials to get in the door and then you have three to five
years to really learn your subject and craft. I&amp;#39;m good with that but I
have a problem with anyone who says &amp;#34;you take it you teach it&amp;#34; is good
enough and I&amp;#39;ve heard of a number of regions that are seriously
considering it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why is this so bad and, I&amp;#39;d argue, dangerous? Not merely because we&amp;#39;ll
end up with substandard CS teachers for the foreseeable future but
also because it undermines the teaching profession as a whole.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s no secret that public education is under attack. A number of
states including Wisconsin, Arizona, Oklahoma, New York and Michigan
have considered relaxing the standards to become a teacher to address
a teacher shortage. In their twisted logic, the politicians and
&amp;#34;reformers&amp;#34; say that we can&amp;#39;t find enough qualified teachers because
we&amp;#39;ve made it an untenable career so let&amp;#39;s lower standards. You can
argue that any current state&amp;#39;s requirements are overly cumbersome but
that&amp;#39;s another conversation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When CS Educators say that all that&amp;#39;s needed to teach CS is to sit in
on a two week APCS institute is saying that to teach any subject you
don&amp;#39;t need content expertise. This is dangerous to education as a
whole and when power players in the CS Ed movement don&amp;#39;t speak up
otherwise or even worse that the stance that &amp;#34;you take it you teach
it&amp;#34; is OK, we&amp;#39;re undermining teaching as a profession.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We need our heavy hitters to publicly and privately say that we need a
short term entry into the profession but we absolutely need plans and
pathways so that at the end of the day we have the best prepared
teachers in our schools for CS and for all subjects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another issue is when as CS Educators we don&amp;#39;t pay attention to the
whole child. I was at a meeting of CSTA people  from about thirty
states a few years ago. Someone asked &amp;#34;how can we advocate for CS when
the school might use it as an excuse to get rid of music?&amp;#34; Cameron
Wilson, at the time a lobbyist for the ACM said something to the
effect of &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m not concerned with other subjects, my concern is
getting CS into the schools.&amp;#34; I get it, he was employed to stump CS
but we have to remember that we&amp;#39;re only a piece of the puzzle. We want
a seat at the table but we have to make sure that the table is
populated with everyone needed to provide a great education for our
kids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A final issue I&amp;#39;ll mention here is how so many CS educators are so
close to the College Board. It was very disturbing that so many CS Ed
players were pushing for more students to take the APCS exam. Not the
class, not some other CS class but the APCS exam. AP is an extremely
controversial subject among teachers and many of us feel that too many
kids take too many AP classes and certainly too many exams. Remember,
the College Board is the organization that pushes things like the
PSAT8/9 another meaningless but high stakes exam inflicted upon our
kids at taxpayer expense. I understand that AP makes things easy -
they have courses, curricula, etc. but we&amp;#39;ve given the college board
an outsized influence on CS education and we&amp;#39;re not paying attention
to their outsized influence on education in general.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m just a small time teacher. I don&amp;#39;t have a national voice. I&amp;#39;m
urging those that do:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Look into what&amp;#39;s going on in greater education. Look at the way
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
public education has been under attack and why.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Look at the side affects of our choices - who we partner with and
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
what policies we push.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We might not agree on the right path but everyone with a voice in CS
Education should be having hard conversations about this and then
strongly advocating for the positions they feel correct.

      <title>A friendly reminder to use the right language when describing CS</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/languages-or-cs/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I was part of this conversation the other day:
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;When science teachers asked me if I taught AP Java I&amp;#39;d always respond by asking them if they taught AP Microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/883327927831711745&#34;&gt;July 7, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I always use that line to emphasize that I teach CS - a way of
thinking and problem solving and looking at the world. The languages
we use in our classes are tools to help us communicate ideas not the
ends but rather a means.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve spent the past couple of days at the CSTA conference. It&amp;#39;s been a
lot of fun. I&amp;#39;ve been spending the time with old friends and meeting
new ones and as everyone who knows me knows - I love talking shop.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I overheard a conversation today. One CS teacher describing what they
did to a few others. I overheard:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We teach Scratch then Swift and C++ and also teach Python
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I heard statements like this describing programs more than a couple of
times. I know we&amp;#39;re at a conference of CS Educators but even in this
community we have everything from beginners getting their feet wet to
hardcore computer scientists to everything in between.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We shouldn&amp;#39;t be teaching languages as an ends unto themselves and the
majority of us don&amp;#39;t.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What many of us do, though, is take the easy path and use the name of
a programming language to describe what we do rather than really
define what we do. This is why we hear &amp;#34;I teach Java&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;I teach a
class in Swift&amp;#34; even when the teacher teaching Java might really be
teaching Object Oriented program design and development or data
structures or something similar just using Java as the language or
tool.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I too fall into this trap but I try to catch myself. I try not to say
&amp;#34;I teach Scheme&amp;#34; but rather I&amp;#39;ll say &amp;#34;I teach Scheme. Actually, we&amp;#39;re
studying functional programming using Scheme as the language but for
convenience, I&amp;#39;ll just say Scheme for the rest of this talk….&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The words we use to describe our field set the tone. If we&amp;#39;re sloppy
and say &amp;#34;we teach Java,&amp;#34; it&amp;#39;s just like biology teacher saying &amp;#34;I
teach microscope.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As we try to define our field in the K12 space and seek equal footing
with established subject areas it&amp;#39;s important that we use the right
language so that other educators and policy makers don&amp;#39;t get the wrong
idea.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Self Certification - not a good idea</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/dont-self-certify/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/dont-self-certify/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
You&amp;#39;ve probably seen an image like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/dont-self-certify/self-signed.png&#34; alt=&#34;/img/dont-self-certify/self-signed.png&#34; title=&#34;/img/dont-self-certify/self-signed.png&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s what you see when you try to access a secure web site but the web
site itself certified itself as being secure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When people see this on a professional site it sets off all manner of
red flags. We feel much more comfortable when go to a site and we
don&amp;#39;t see that error. When we see the secure green lock in the url bar
indicating that this site is certified through an external trusted
source.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s take this a step further. If you needed surgery would you go to
a board certified surgeon or would you go to Dr. Nick Riviera or some
other &amp;#34;self certified&amp;#34; doctor? Likewise you wouldn&amp;#39;t want to be
represented in court by someone who hasn&amp;#39;t passed the bar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We might not feel that these certification and licensing processes are
perfect but when we need the services of a doctor or lawyer, we&amp;#39;re
happy these gatekeepers exist.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So we should all be extremely concerned with today&amp;#39;s announcement that
the deal for mayoral control just brokered in NYC came with strings
attached and one of those strings looks to open the doors to give some
charter chains the ability to self certify their teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s a story on it in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2017/07/06/with-city-charters-poised-to-win-certification-deal-education-schools-fret-113243&#34;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt; and one in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2017/07/06/some-charter-school-teachers-could-become-certified-without-a-masters-under-proposed-new-suny-rules/&#34;&gt;Chalkbeat&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One might think that some requirements to become a teacher are
ridiculous. I&amp;#39;ll get to them later  but this is really giving the fox
the keys to the henhouse.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Charters appear to have extremely high rates of teacher attrition so
it makes sense that they want to control their teacher pipeline. This
alone should be a red flag against self certification but what else
are charter chains known for?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Misleading stats - claiming amazing passing numbers on standardized
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
exams while neglecting to mention that somehow or other big blocks
of students were removed from the school prior to the test year
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shankerinstitute.org/blog/student-attrition-and-backfilling-success-academy-charter-schools-what-student-enrollment&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The gotta go list
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Forcing high levels of parent involvement (tough for single working
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
parents)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Charging &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/education/article/KIPP-schools-collected-millions-in-unallowable-11257006.php&#34;&gt;illegal fees&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Top this off with as taking resources from public schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Charters operate in anything but a transparent manner and we&amp;#39;re
expected to trust them to prepare &amp;#34;highly effective&amp;#34; teachers? I don&amp;#39;t
think so. Since there is no real accountability for charter schools -
they can easily game the system through student attrition, selective
admissions (by putting up barriers to enter the lottery) and test prep
they can pay lip service to teacher preparation and the public will be
none the wiser.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we had a reasonable way of holding principals accountable and no,
test scores are not the answer then we could pretty much do away
with teacher certification. If principals were held to task to run an
effective school, something we can easily define but not measure, then
they would have every incentive to hire the best
teachers. Unfortunately we&amp;#39;re nowhere near that place.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since we&amp;#39;re not, we&amp;#39;re left with the current systems of teacher
certification that has it&amp;#39;s own slew of problems. A big part of it, in
my opinion is that schools of education have lost the high
ground. While there are some institutions doing great work, reputation
wise, schools of education are held in very low regard. Strong
teachers trade stories of the watered down content classes and waste
of time classes where professors share their pet theories of
education. I can&amp;#39;t tell you how many times I&amp;#39;ve heard the new
definitive way to teach. At the same time, education research is
frequently held in low regard by teachers and the general public.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the one hand we have charters run by and support by non-educators
wanting us to trust them and on the other we have institutions that
are questioned by the teachers they produce and the general public.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What a mess.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know the answer. I&amp;#39;m working on teacher certifications
programs at Hunter and it&amp;#39;s a balancing act. How much content is
sufficient and how much is too much. Can any of the general content be
streamlined or is it all necessary. If it isn&amp;#39;t necessary do we need
it anyway to satisfy the bean counters?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you don&amp;#39;t have enough then we&amp;#39;re sending unprepared teachers into
the classroom. Too much and we&amp;#39;ll drive potential teachers away.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As computer science education is defining itself we see similar
struggles. We have some people advocating certifications analogous to
existing teacher certifications. On the other extreme we have
advocates for two weeks summer training and you&amp;#39;re a CS teacher. I&amp;#39;d
like to think that I&amp;#39;m advocating for the sweet spot. Strong content
knowledge not tied to a specific course and matching content related
pedagogy. Time will tell becomes the certification standard and time
will tell whose approach was right.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For now, it&amp;#39;s important not to give away the store. Private charter
schools should not be the driving force behind teacher certification
and they certainly shouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed to train their own teachers
and then &amp;#39;teach&amp;#39; our students without much greater scrutiny.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Addendum:
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m sure some of my friends will point out that private schools aren&amp;#39;t
held to any particular standard for teacher certification. This is
true but private schools don&amp;#39;t take public funds. Actually they do but
in my opinion, they shouldn&amp;#39;t. I maintain that charter schools are
publicly funded private schools in that they take public money but
operate as private entities. As such they should be held under the
greatest of scrutiny and standards – they aren&amp;#39;t
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Plea to AP teachers- don&#39;t measure yourself by your scores</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/teachers-you-arent-your-test-scores/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/teachers-you-arent-your-test-scores/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
AP scores just came out. As usual, I see the posts and take part in
conversations where teachers talk about their results. Some are happy
about their results, some aren&amp;#39;t, some don&amp;#39;t really care.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I just want to make a plea to all AP teachers out there:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t let your value be dictated by the college board or any other
exam.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I never really cared much about my students&amp;#39; actual AP scores. There
were a number of years when I never even saw the results. Of course, I
had a population that would do reasonably well regardless of teacher
so I was never placed under any pressure to &amp;#34;do better.&amp;#34; One year -
while the APCS-AB exam was still offered, my principal called me down
to discuss the results to see if we could get more kids scoring 4s and
5s (which most of the kids already did). I told him that I thought
we were doing fine, explained why I couldn&amp;#39;t advocate more teaching to
the test (such as more than paying lip service to the case study or
more rote practice on the multiple choice), and told him how I
measured our success as a program. He was happy with my answer and
that was that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The AP exam is one test on one day and in my opinion the least
valuable measure of my students&amp;#39; achievement. This is one of
the reasons I was so dismayed by the CSEd community&amp;#39;s efforts in
pushing the AP exams - not the class or the subject but the actual exam.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, how should you judge your success? That&amp;#39;s up to you. I can only
tell you how I judge myself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First and foremost - and I know this sounds cheesy - are you a &amp;#34;force
for good&amp;#34; in your student&amp;#39;s lives. Do you leave them in a better
place? Have you opened the door to a possible future for them? Have
you helped them grow? Beyond that, have they progressed in your
subject and as students in general.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve had kids &amp;#34;fail&amp;#34; the AP exam and go on to wonderful careers in
tech and come back to thank me for giving them their start. I&amp;#39;ve also
had kids that have gone into other fields but appreciate what we&amp;#39;ve
done for them. I&amp;#39;ve also had my failures and I do mean my
failures. Students I couldn&amp;#39;t reach or couldn&amp;#39;t figure out how to
help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As teachers, we work day to day trying to improve but we can get a
great overview of how we&amp;#39;re doing by using a much longer feedback
loop - looking at what our graduates are up to. When young teachers
would comment on former students coming back or running into them at
tech events that they would have graduates of their own in a few years
and invariably they do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To really evaluate how you&amp;#39;re doing you have to go with the long
game. Very few people get that. I remember talking to a Google
Executive while I was designing CAPE 2010. He said something to the
effect of &amp;#34;I know we won&amp;#39;t know if this program works for about ten
years but we&amp;#39;ll have to come up with something short term to satisfy
the powers that be.&amp;#34;  That so few &amp;#34;get it&amp;#34; and need instant feedback
is one of the reasons that our society is so test driven. We shouldn&amp;#39;t
be. Our focus should be on helping the students learn and progress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So don&amp;#39;t get distressed over AP results and don&amp;#39;t get to high on them
either. Certainly don&amp;#39;t use them to drive what and how you teach. Let
your students and your conscience be your guide.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CS Teachers - teacher first or content first</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/teacher-to-cs-or-cs-to-teacher/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/teacher-to-cs-or-cs-to-teacher/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Is it easier to take CS people and teach them to teach or is it easier
to take teachers and teach them CS?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The question gets batted around from time to time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This time via twitter:
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Some think it&amp;#39;s easier to teach a teacher to teach CS than to teach a CS pro to teach. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alfredtwo&#34;&gt;@alfredtwo&lt;/a&gt; is not one of them &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/QCUP8d8llZ&#34;&gt;https://t.co/QCUP8d8llZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Diane Levitt (@diane_levitt) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/diane_levitt/status/881874056911388673&#34;&gt;July 3, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Agreed. It takes a lot of work. More than a week long workshop.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Alfred Thompson (@alfredtwo) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alfredtwo/status/882243591090962432&#34;&gt;July 4, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34;
charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The conversation was referring to blog posts by &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/06/become-computer-science-teacher-in-five.html?spref=tw&amp;amp;m=1&#34;&gt;Alfred Thompson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gflint.wordpress.com/2017/06/20/a-week-of-in-service-another-python-course/&#34;&gt;Garth flint&lt;/a&gt;.
Alfred&amp;#39;s key point - one that I&amp;#39;ve spoken about before is that short
term professional development does not a CS teacher make.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As to the lead in question? I&amp;#39;ve seen both routes succeed and both
routes fail. Both can be heavy lifts but there&amp;#39;s a missing part of the
equation that&amp;#39;s never addressed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The claim is that it&amp;#39;s easier to teach CS to a non-CS teacher because
they already know how to teach. The problem is, particularly in the
later grades that teachers of different subject areas have very
different tool sets. Sure, there are common factors – get the kids
involved, layer, spiral, etc. but you don&amp;#39;t teach a CS lesson the same
way you teach a math lesson let alone a literature, history, language
lesson.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In a math class, it&amp;#39;s common to have students write solutions to
problems up on the board. If you try that in a CS class, you&amp;#39;ll be
waiting 20 minutes while the kids transcribe the problems. Likewise,
math homework will likely consist of a certain amount of repetitive
practice problems whereas a CS class won&amp;#39;t have something directly
analogous. This is not to say that you don&amp;#39;t have opportunities for
students to present at the board in CS class or that there isn&amp;#39;t
worthwhile homework but rather that even at this simple level, there
are differences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, if we&amp;#39;re going to teach a non-CS teacher the CS content, beyond
the challenge of giving them the necessary depth and breadth of
content knowledge we have to teach them how to teach CS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve inventoried some of the techniques my colleagues and I have used
in our classes and the collected methods could easily fill a couple of
graduate education courses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what&amp;#39;s the answer to the question? It doesn&amp;#39;t matter where you
start but if we want to do right by our kids we need to prepare them
in not two but three areas:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
CS Content
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
CS Pedagogy
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
General education and pedagogy
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Short term PD (professional development) won&amp;#39;t do it and neither will
scripts for &amp;#34;teachers&amp;#34; to follow. It&amp;#39;s going to take time, will, and
effort.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s hoping that municipalities look at the long game. It&amp;#39;s fine to
do PD now to get something started but it&amp;#39;s not enough. I wanted my
kids math teachers to know math and how to teach it. We should demand
no less from our CS teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Retaining Teachers</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/on-retaining-teachers/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/on-retaining-teachers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Back in February, I shared my thoughts on &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/will-we-lose-cs-teachers-to-industry&#34;&gt;losing CS teachers to the
tech industy&lt;/a&gt;. TL;DR - I don&amp;#39;t think it will be a CS Ed problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That said, I do think that it will be hard to find good CS teachers
but the reason is because it will get harder and harder to find good
teachers in general.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are plenty of reasons why it&amp;#39;s harder to become a
career teacher but I don&amp;#39;t want to talk about those today. There are
also plenty of powerful forces working to destroy public schools and
teaching as a career but this post isn&amp;#39;t about that either.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This post is my attempt to tell people what teachers are actually
looking for. Some people assert that merit pay or similar &amp;#34;real world&amp;#34;
incentives will keep good teachers teaching but teachers are a
different breed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, I can&amp;#39;t speak for all teachers but I can talk about myself
and teachers I&amp;#39;ve known and worked with over the years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I never thought I&amp;#39;d be a teacher, it was just something I tried when I
was dissatisfied with Wall Street. I tried it, it stuck. I didn&amp;#39;t feel
at the time that teaching was my calling but somehow or other, I made
a career of it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start, schools are not factories, companies, stores, or any other
type of business. Teachers spend most of their days with students and
little time with each other. Most of their time is allocated for
them. A high school teacher in NY will likely teach 5 class of 34 kids
each, have 1 period for lunch, 1 for preparation and 1 assigned to
some school task. You probably won&amp;#39;t see your supervisor much. Mostly
at monthly meetings and when they observe you. Observations are
ostensibly for teacher evaluation and improvement but the system is
does neither well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teachers also don&amp;#39;t have the same types of career paths as a other
professionals do. If you want to remain a classroom teacher, there is
no career path. You could become an assistant principal or principal
but those opportunities take you away from the kids and from your
subject area. They say teaching is a calling and for career classroom
teachers it probably is. For those who spent a few years in a
classroom and left for what they see as greener pastures, maybe not.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So instead teachers make a career by honing their craft, creating electives,
working with clubs and teams, or doing something similar that doesn&amp;#39;t
remove them from the classroom.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my case, I developed some electives and one thing led to another
and I ended up where I am today.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The career situation of the teacher is why things like merit pay never
work. As a teacher, I want, in fact need my colleagues to do well. I
might have your kids next year and if you do a poor job I&amp;#39;ll end up
suffering with the results. Sure, I&amp;#39;d like to be recognized as one of
the better teachers but it&amp;#39;s not healthy for my students, my school,
or my career if I&amp;#39;m pitted against my fellow teacher. We&amp;#39;re all in
this together.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teachers do accept merit pay when it&amp;#39;s forced on them though. As a
friend of mine once said - it&amp;#39;s like the teacher lottery - the way
they assign the merit bonuses are based on those bogus state exams so
the distribution is pretty random, one year I&amp;#39;ll get it, another year
someone else.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is not to say that teachers couldn&amp;#39;t use a higher salary but even
then, teachers are not driven by the same motivations as business
people. I don&amp;#39;t know of any teacher who feels that they&amp;#39;d work harder
for more pay or that they work any less hard if they&amp;#39;re paid less.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teachers work and fight for their kids because that&amp;#39;s what we
do. Right before I left Stuy for Hunter, the teachers and city agreed
to a new contract. All of a sudden I got a pay raise. I can tell you
that I was neither a better or worse of a teacher the day after the
contract went into affect than the day before.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My mentor and friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-11-07-rich-rich.html&#34;&gt;Richard Rothenberg&lt;/a&gt; talked to me about the deal we
make with society as teachers early in my career. He said, once you
get a few years in and have some seniority you&amp;#39;re pretty secure and
you&amp;#39;re only worry has to be teaching. We don&amp;#39;t do great in the good
times but we do OK. On the other hand, we still have jobs in the bad
times although, again, we don&amp;#39;t do great. We put in a lifetime of
service knowing that we won&amp;#39;t get any significant financial reward but
at the end of the day between our contributions and the city/state&amp;#39;s
investments we&amp;#39;ll get a pension and won&amp;#39;t be out in the cold in our
retirement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The point is that those of us meant to be teachers were never looking
for the fast track to the upper class. We work to make a difference
and want society to enable us to make that difference. Teachers don&amp;#39;t
have to be paid like they are in &amp;#34;the real world&amp;#34; but they do need to
put a roof over their heads, send their kids to college and have a
vacation now and again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s not too much to ask but in this day and age it&amp;#39;s apparently too
much to give.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mayoral Control - only when your guy&#39;s the mayor</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/mayoral-control/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/mayoral-control/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The hot debate this past week in NY Education circles is Mayoral
Control. When I started teaching, New York City schools were
controlled by the Board of Education. The board appointed a
chancellor. The system was supposed to balance community control as
well as some centralized decision making. The system was created in
the late 60s and was entrenched through my schooling. By the time I
was a teacher I think it was pretty much a given that the system
didn&amp;#39;t work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 2002, everything changed with Mayoral control under Michael
Bloomberg. Under mayoral control, the mayor appoints the chancellor
who appoints superintendents an on down the line. This was supposed to
create a chain of accountability leading up to and including the
mayor. To address concerns that parents voices would be heard, we had
the Panel for Educational Policy or PEP which was supposed to vet and
vote on policy and initiatives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sounds good.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, it was all a farce.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Parents may or may not have had a voice under the old system but they
certainly didn&amp;#39;t have a voice with mayoral control. The majority of
members of the panel were mayoral appointees and if they didn&amp;#39;t vote
100% in line with their masters wishes, they were removed for someone
who would. Schools were closed and initiatives were passed that were
wildly unpopular with parents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What did we get under mayoral control? There was some good, but we
also got:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
100% buy in to the pet education theories of non-educators like Bill
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
gates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
School leaders who barely taught and had little experience as
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
educators.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Destruction of neighborhood schools
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Destruction of just about all of the large comprehensive high schools
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Open doors for private charter schools that follow questionable
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
practices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Flawed (at best)  school and teacher evaluation models
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The ATR pool
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, reformers - those out to privatize education loved mayoral
control under Bloomberg. It destabilized teaching as a career
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Did results improve?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some would say yes but it&amp;#39;s debatable. Graduation rates and test
scores are controlled by the politicians. When you have tests made,
graded, and curved in secret (except for those charter schools that
are exempt or grade their own tests), you&amp;#39;ve got to question any gains
or losses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bloomberg&amp;#39;s failing was (and possibly still is) that he and his
appointees didn&amp;#39;t understand education or teachers. Education not a
business and can&amp;#39;t be treated the same way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Did this help with accountability? To quote Mr. Bloomberg: &amp;#34;They can
boo me at parades.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fast forward to the de Blasio administration. Personally, I was not a
fan of Bloomberg&amp;#39;s educational policy and I also feel that de Blasio&amp;#39;s
also doing a poor job. Regardless of my opinion, Mayoral control under
de Blasio has certainly felt more community friendly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This hasn&amp;#39;t sat well with the reformers upstate and while Michael
Bloomberg was granted mayoral control for his entire term, Bill de
Blasio has had to fight for it every year and every year control has
come with strings attached – generally involving the flow of money
into private charter schools - still with questionable practices and
results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The funny thing is that many of those saying mayoral control was bad
during the Bloomberg era say it&amp;#39;s a necessity now  and many against it
under Bloomberg are fans under de Blasio.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What&amp;#39;s even funnier, in a tragic way is that it isn&amp;#39;t really even
control. So much is really controlled in Albany under Governor
Cuomo. When de Blasio wanted to charge private charters for space
(rightfully so, in my opinion), Albany stepped in and gave the
charters a free pass. How is that mayoral control?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regardless of your political leanings, it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that mayoral
control is only a good thing when the mayor is your guy. We need
something brand new that supports our communities. I was at the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://personaldemocracy.com/conference&#34;&gt;Personal Democracy Forum 2017&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago and a recurring
theme, one which we really need now for our schools is:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;build with, not for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we don&amp;#39;t get there we&amp;#39;ll be stuck booing our politicians at parades.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SIGCSE 2017</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse-2017/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse-2017/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Tomorrow morning I fly out to Seattle for SIGCSE 2017. For those of
you not in the CS Education space, SIGCSE is the ACM (Association for
Computing Machinery) special interest group for computer science education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve wanted to go for years but have never been able. It&amp;#39;s hard for a
high school teacher to miss a week in mid March, particularly in
places with a school calendar similar to New York. NY city schools are
already closed for a week in February and then Spring Break is right
around the corner. If you&amp;#39;re teaching an AP course with the exam in
early May, losing a week in March is really not an option. Even if you
can take the time, you&amp;#39;ll probably have to foot the bill out of
pocket.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now that I&amp;#39;m at Hunter, I&amp;#39;ve got more flexibility in terms of schedule
and attending is probably even more important given my current roles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m looking forward to the talks and events but probably even more
looking forward to seeing old friends, meeting new ones and seeing
face to face friends that til now I&amp;#39;ve only known through the web.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On Saturday I&amp;#39;ll be part of a panel (thanks &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cscheerleader&#34;&gt;Ria&lt;/a&gt;) titled &amp;#34;Tools we
can&amp;#39;t live without.&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;ll probably talk about the way I use git and
GitHub and how I get my students up to speed but there are lots of
tools I can talk about.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I plan to write up a series of posts on how I use GitHub (and how it
evolved from other versioning systems) as well as thoughts about other
tools I&amp;#39;ve used and some I&amp;#39;ve struggled with.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re going to be at SIGCSE drop me a line, I&amp;#39;d love to connect.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Will we lose CS teachers to industry?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/draft-will-we-lose-cs-teachers-to-industry/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/draft-will-we-lose-cs-teachers-to-industry/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we properly prepare CS teachers, won&amp;#39;t they just jump ship and take
tech industry jobs?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I hear that a lot.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tech pays big. Teaching? Not so much. Tech workers are respected and
have flexible jobs. Teaching? Again, not so much.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Those chanting these refrains advocate the current simple teacher
&amp;#34;training&amp;#34; - scripted lessons, minimal pedagogical content knowledge,
even less real content knowledge. That  will keep them in the classroom.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They&amp;#39;re wrong.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
People fearing an exodus of prepared CS teachers don&amp;#39;t get
education. True, many young CS teachers will leave the profession but
that&amp;#39;s because &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;many young teachers leave the profession&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Why do young
teachers leave? Regardless of subject area some of the reasons are:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s much harder than everyone thinks it is
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Low pay
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lack of respect
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Overworked
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lack of autonomy
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Being scapegoated for poverty
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s become about testing, not teaching
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
None of these are unique to computer science teachers so the argument
that CS teachers who know too much will leave is really saying, &amp;#34;we
have to keep our teachers dumb enough to stay - make sure they don&amp;#39;t
have outside options&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;let&amp;#39;s make teaching a desirable
profession to be in.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, this is bred from a lack of understanding about what drives
teachers. It&amp;#39;s typical of politicians and business leaders and short
term temps like TFAers who came in for a cup of coffee and now know
how to solve the education problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teacher don&amp;#39;t become teachers to
get rich or to do better than the other guy – I know I didn&amp;#39;t. We
enter it to do good - to uplift the have nots. This is why business
models like stack ranking and bonus or merit pay just don&amp;#39;t work. A
school is a team and we&amp;#39;re all in it together. Our job is to take care
of our kids, not to be better than that other guy. We wish we had more
time to work together and to improve things for our entire population.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back to computer science.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My contention is that you might lose some teachers to industry but
they either weren&amp;#39;t meant to be teachers anyway or they couldn&amp;#39;t
afford to be teachers or the system beat them down. None of these are
reasons not to properly prepare them. Besides, all teachers in all
subject areas could work their way into an entry level tech job via a
summer coding boot camp.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We can also look to the past to allay concerns. While it&amp;#39;s true that
for hiring purposes, English teachers are a dime a dozen and
candidates typically
have fewer outside options (although great English teachers are harder
to find), Math and Science teachers generally have options. I know
many top Math and Science teachers who could easily get non teaching
jobs - the Math teachers in finance the science, certainly in
pharmaceutical companies over in NJ. These options exist yet we manage
to populate our classes with teachers. True, it&amp;#39;s difficult at times,
particularly in Physics, but these are due to the lack of respect
teaching gets as a profession.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we prepare CS teachers properly, yes, we&amp;#39;ll lose some, but we&amp;#39;ll
keep the ones we&amp;#39;re supposed to or if we lose them it will be due to
other factors. Additionally, by having proper CS teacher
preparation programs, we&amp;#39;ll also provide an entry path to those people
meant to be teachers but prior had no way of getting in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a nation, we&amp;#39;re moving away from prepared, knowledgeable teachers
and towards drill-masters. Let&amp;#39;s not let CS Education go the way of
all ed.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quality Devs and Coding Contests</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/quality-devs-and-coding-contests/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/quality-devs-and-coding-contests/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been planning to put together a response to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alfredtwo&#34;&gt;Alfred Thompson&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s
recent post - &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/02/software-developersquantity-vs-quality.html&#34;&gt;Software Developers - Quantity vs Quality&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
TL;DR, although it isn&amp;#39;t really long and I do encourage you to read
Alfred&amp;#39;s post: a couple of articles talk about how the U.S. has the most
people entering CS competitions like HackerRank but Americans are not
at the top of the leaderboard. does this mean that there&amp;#39;s less talent
in America? Does it even matter?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before getting to &amp;#34;does it matter,&amp;#34; I looked over at the Kaggle
leaderboards. Looking at their top 10, 2 were from the US - no other
country had more than 1. The 11th placing competitor was also from the
US and then 12 was from China, giving them 2 in the top 12.  I also
looked at recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://stats.ioinformatics.org/delegations/2016?sort=total_desc&#34;&gt;IOI results&lt;/a&gt; and a quick glance seems to indicate that
the USA seems to do reasonably well. In short, if you buy into ranking
a country by these types of individual results on specific
competitions then we&amp;#39;re doing fine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But, does filling the leaderboard mean a country&amp;#39;s producing the best
tech talent? Probably not.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Coding competitions focus on a specific skill set. There are problem
solving aspects but they also require speed, knowledge of data
structures and algorithms, and, yes, even accurate, fast typing
skills. They also require you work alone. They don&amp;#39;t encourage well
designed, architected, or written code, working on existing code bases
or working with a team.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over the years, I&amp;#39;ve known some very smart and talented individuals
who&amp;#39;ve excelled at these types of competitions. If you extend the pool
to math and science competitions, I&amp;#39;ve known quite a few. These
individuals have by and large done well for themselves but as a group,
you couldn&amp;#39;t call them more successful than any other subset of my
former students. A number of them have gone on and are doing well as
professors or programmers but, by and large, they&amp;#39;re not the ones
who&amp;#39;ve gone on to found companies and provide jobs for scores or even
hundreds of other people and they&amp;#39;re not necessarily the ones who&amp;#39;ve
led teams that have developed major platforms and projects[fn::Some
are but probably a smaller percent from that group than from the
general pool.]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t argue that people who populate competition leaderboards are
talented and a necessary part of our tech ecosystem but they&amp;#39;re only a
part. I probably want one of these programmers on my team, but not as
the entire team (see Fake Grimlock&amp;#39;s laws of startups - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/secret-laws-startups-part-2-build-right-team&#34;&gt;law 9&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;div align=&amp;#34;center&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/secret-laws-startups-part-2-build-right-team&#34;&gt;http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/secret-laws-startups-part-2-build-right-team&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;img width=&amp;#34;30%&amp;#34;,
src=&amp;#34;&lt;img src=&#34;http://media3.cdn.builtinchicago.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/Original/images/BATMAN-THEN-ROBIN.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;http://media3.cdn.builtinchicago.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/Original/images/BATMAN-THEN-ROBIN.jpg&#34; title=&#34;http://media3.cdn.builtinchicago.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/Original/images/BATMAN-THEN-ROBIN.jpg&#34; /&gt;&amp;#34;
/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Competitive programming is a piece of the puzzle as competitive
programmers are a part of the population. So are project based events
like &lt;a href=&#34;https://dreamitcodeitwinit.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;Dream it. Code it. Win it.&lt;/a&gt;, science fairs, and hackathons, which
can be either cooperative, competitive, or a combination.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What do we want? Balance. I think the Stuy program does it pretty
well. StuyCS graduates who wish to take part in coding competitions
can do so but if they want to excel at it, they have to work at it on
their own time. At the same time, the students learn how to work in
teams and take a project from idea to delivery all the while learning
some good academic CS and software engineering practices. They&amp;#39;ll
learn more in college on the academic side and the rest on the
job. I&amp;#39;d love to see better balance in the colleges between CS
programs preparing kids for graduate programs and CS programs that
prepare kids for industry. I&amp;#39;d also love to see CS minors that were
more targeted towards CS+X rather than half of a CS major targeting
students going to grad schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also think there&amp;#39;s a tremendous opportunity for community colleges
to fill the role currently occupied by code schools. They could more
easily strike a balance between academic depth and practical
preparation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m working on building Hunter College&amp;#39;s honors CS program and while I
can&amp;#39;t move the Hunter curriculum, I&amp;#39;m seeking that balance in my own
way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Will we get there? I don&amp;#39;t know. Given the way education works, I
figure at some point people will decide that we have to have more of a
presence on the CS leaderboards and we&amp;#39;ll see programs pop up with
that in mind. I have no doubt that when that happens, we&amp;#39;ll see many
more Americans near the top. We have a large enough population that
talent shouldn&amp;#39;t be in question. This will be great for students to
whom these competitions attract. It won&amp;#39;t do much, however for the
rest of the students. I&amp;#39;m not really concerned one way or
another. Unlike math, where there&amp;#39;s a natural progression through K12
math classes with math team and math competitions being a natural add
on, the driving forces in CS - be they from industry, government, or
academia don&amp;#39;t seem to have partaken in any code competition Kool-Aid
so code competitions won&amp;#39;t become a driving force in CS ed any time
soon.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Starting with scheme</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/staring-with-scheme/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/staring-with-scheme/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Scheme is one of the languages used in Stuy&amp;#39;s intro CS course. Like
any other language, there are pros and cons of using it to introduce
students to CS. Here are some of the reasons why I like Scheme as a
first language and why despite that,  I don&amp;#39;t recommend it in many
cases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Scheme certainly isn&amp;#39;t mainstream. That&amp;#39;s not the main reason why I
like it but it is a side benefit. It&amp;#39;s less likely kids come into
class knowing it which creates a level playing field. The few times
I&amp;#39;ve had a student with a background in Scheme, they&amp;#39;ve been good,
helpful kids rather than ones that tried to show off and dominate the
class.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like scheme because it&amp;#39;s simple. It looks different than other
languages but is &lt;code&gt;(+ 3 4)&lt;/code&gt; really that different than &lt;code&gt;add(3,4)&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;3+4&lt;/code&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We can tell kids &amp;#34;everything&amp;#39;s a function.&amp;#34; While technically not
true, and I tell my students that it isn&amp;#39;t, it&amp;#39;s close enough for our
purposes. Everything&amp;#39;s a function and the way we write a function is:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-scheme&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-scheme&#34; data-lang=&#34;scheme&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-scheme&#34; data-lang=&#34;scheme&#34;&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; a b &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Apply function &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;f&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on arguments &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b c …&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. So we have &lt;code&gt;(+ 2 3)&lt;/code&gt; to
add 2 and 3, &lt;code&gt;(and a b)&lt;/code&gt; for logical and &lt;code&gt;(= 3 4)&lt;/code&gt; to test to see if 3
is equal to 4, etc. We also have the same basic notation for things
like conditionals. In java, we might write:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-java&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In scheme, it would be:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-scheme&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-scheme&#34; data-lang=&#34;scheme&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-scheme&#34; data-lang=&#34;scheme&#34;&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;(&amp;gt; a &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even though we&amp;#39;re fudging the rules, we can lay out a handful of rules
for the kids such as lambda and define follow a similar form to create and
name functions:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-scheme&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-scheme&#34; data-lang=&#34;scheme&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-scheme&#34; data-lang=&#34;scheme&#34;&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;define &lt;/span&gt;add2 (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;lambda &lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; b) (+ a b)))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
where &lt;code&gt;(lambda (a b) (+ a b))&lt;/code&gt; returns a function that adds &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;code&gt;define&lt;/code&gt; associates it with the identifier &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;add2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Now we
can use the function: &lt;code&gt;(add2 5 10)&lt;/code&gt; which evaluates to 15.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With lambda, define, if, and a few more basics, it&amp;#39;s off to the
races. The simple, consistent syntax makes things easy for the kids
and the constrained tool set lets us focus their way of thinking.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course this wouldn&amp;#39;t work had DrScheme (now &lt;a href=&#34;https://racket-lang.org/&#34;&gt;Racket&lt;/a&gt;) not
existed. That gave us a nice learning IDE to work in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using Scheme, we can not only cover the basics like conditionals,
abstraction and such but also deeper concepts like recursion, map,
filter, and reduce. When we move on from Scheme, the kids also have a
frame of reference for all the other languages and paradigms they use.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are downsides, however. Outside help is harder to come by and
there is some pushback from parents and it isn&amp;#39;t as pretty and flashy
as some other tool-sets. Scheme worked at Stuy for a number of
reasons. When I created the class that used it, there were no good
pre-AP classes in the school and I had a pretty good reputation as a
teacher. The class also used multiple tools with &lt;a href=&#34;https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/&#34;&gt;NetLogo&lt;/a&gt; being the
primary other one and tackled a variety of CS and non CS topics.
First time through, reputation and buzz filled the classes and after
that, the class developed a solid enough reputation to fill itself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It also didn&amp;#39;t hurt that our program developed from the inside
out. First, we had APCS-AB on the books as a junior year course, then
I added our post AP senior year electives. Since it was easy to show
what the kids were already graduating with, it was easy to diffuse any
pushback from not using mainstream tools in the first class.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Scheme worked at Stuy and I feel that it still does. Would I use
Scheme for a first experience in a drop in program at an after-school
where kids might not come back if they don&amp;#39;t get to a payoff
immediately? Probably not. Would I recommend it at a school where I
want to integrate CS with some of the other subjects quickly, again,
probably not (except for integration with algebra where &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bootstrapworld.org/&#34;&gt;Bootstrapworld&lt;/a&gt;
is a terrific program).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event, if you&amp;#39;re a high school CS teacher and  haven&amp;#39;t played
with scheme  or some other functional language, I highly recommend
it - you might not actually ever teach it or use it but it can really
help develop you as a programmer and an educator.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selecting a starting language - why not Javascript</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/starting-with-js/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/starting-with-js/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I was catching up with the team at Stuy the other day and they
mentioned that they were periodically getting pushback on their choice
of languages, particularly in the intro class. The pushback was mostly
in the form of &amp;#34;why don&amp;#39;t you start them with Javascript?&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back in the day, when I created our intro class where we use Scheme,
NetLogo and then later Python, I&amp;#39;d get similar pushback but then it
was &amp;#34;why not Java?&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;why not C?&amp;#34;, or &amp;#34;whu not C++?&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We had a good discussion on this and I shared my thoughts as to why I
don&amp;#39;t like Javascript as a first language and I thought I&amp;#39;d share some
of them here. I&amp;#39;ll try to get around to the rationale behind Scheme
and NetLogo in a later post.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start, let me say that I &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Javascript -
particularly when approaching it as a functional language. I also
think every school and situation is different so there are likely
times when Javascript is the right beginner language for the job.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s dive in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why are some of the pluses for Javascript as an intro language.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ubiquity and availability:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you have a browser, you have Javascript - it&amp;#39;s also available
through online IDEs and online lightweight sites like &lt;a href=&#34;https://jsfiddle.net/&#34;&gt;JSFiddle&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Interactivity:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can tweak websites almost live, use the HTML5 canvas pretty
interactively and mode
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s mainstream
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s quick to get up and running
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is all true, but there are also downsides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of my big problems with Javascript is the lack of simple solid
educational tooling. I love to use tools like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drjava.org/&#34;&gt;DrJava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://drpython.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;DrPython&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://racket-lang.org/&#34;&gt;Racket&lt;/a&gt; (formerly DrScheme) with beginners. All simple learning
IDEs. True, you can use a simple online IDE but I haven&amp;#39;t found them
to have as strong a learning interface. They also, generally, keep you
in an oversimplified programming sandbox. There&amp;#39;s no clean transition
from the sandbox to the real deal - particularly given the non-trivial
state of js build tools and environments. These simple learning IDEs
set the stage and then we can transition to more powerful development environments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also prefer, where possible, to have kids learn locally so that they
can learn something about the underlying operating system even if
only at a user level.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A problem relating to the lack of tooling is the fact that a JS
program can fail to run and not give you any meaningful feedback at
all - this is a problem for a beginner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Javascript also has all sorts of wonkiness. We have &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;
which is pretty conventional, but then there&amp;#39;s also &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt;. We have
potentially confusing scoping issues and also some other real
weirdness:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-js&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34; data-lang=&#34;js&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For more, check out the this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. Start watching at about 1:20 -
it&amp;#39;s a riot.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of this weirdness actually makes sense - just not to a beginner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Javascript also gives plenty of freedom - there are many ways to do
things. This can be great for the developer but not necessarily ideal
for the learner. Loops, recursion, mapping functions - you name it,
Javascript&amp;#39;s got it. I like simpler languages for beginners because
it&amp;#39;s easier to get them thinking and problem solving in certain ways
when there tool set is somewhat restricted (more on that when I write
about Scheme).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, the fact that Javascript&amp;#39;s a mainstream language can be a
minus. Given its popularity, a beginner class could have at  least a
few kid who&amp;#39;ve at least played with the language. This can lead them
to think they know more than they do and more importantly, this can
be intimidating to the real newbies who develop the impression that
&amp;#34;everyone knows this but me.&amp;#34; A less mainstream language puts everyone
on a level playing field.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let me say again that I love javascript as a language and before a
student graduates Stuy they can learn all about Javascript, front end
development, some functional programming, and more. It&amp;#39;s just not the
right language to start with - at least not at Stuy.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Should CS Ed be in bed with the College Board</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-ed-in-bed-college-board/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-ed-in-bed-college-board/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m guessing my views  on this aren&amp;#39;t very popular -that&amp;#39;s OK, every
community needs a curmudgeon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A few years ago, I cautioned if we weren&amp;#39;t careful, once the big
players got involved, CS Ed would go the way of other disciplines, and
not in a good way. It looks like indeed we&amp;#39;re well on our way down
that road.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve ranted before about things like non-profits, drop in and summer
programs. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-07-learning-takes-time.html/#.WJXSS99vHmE&#34;&gt;STEM Oil Salesmen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-reference&#34;&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;footnote-reference-1&#34; href=&#34;#footnote-1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
selling easy fixes, exciting kids and parents, using the Think Method
just like Professor Harold Hill only to send the kids off where they
can blame a future teacher for failure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve also ranted about teacher preparation and how all the rage is
short term, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/scotland/#.WJXT999vHmE&#34;&gt;Superficial PD and scripted curricula&lt;/a&gt;  and my concern that
once the politicians can say CS is in the schools, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-03-04-expedient-vs-good.html/#.WJXT7d9vHmE&#34;&gt;we&amp;#39;ll be done&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been working towards getting CS to all students for most of my
career and while it&amp;#39;s wonderful to see us getting closer to the goal,
I&amp;#39;m seeing more and more signs that my caution is becoming
reality. and CS Ed is going the way of other Ed - aligned to testing
and more to the whims of the power players and politicians than to
teachers and students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other week I noticed, &lt;a href=&#34;http://teacherblog.code.org/post/156278055294/ap-cs-principles-could-make-history-how-can-we&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by Code.org trying to encourage
more students to take the APCSP exam - not encourage more students
take the class or some other class or to have more students be exposed
to CS but to actually sit for the APCSP exam. That post was followed
by &lt;a href=&#34;http://teacherblog.code.org/post/156689658029/ask-your-cs-principles-students-to-star-in-our&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; which also highlights actually taking the exam.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This didn&amp;#39;t sit well with me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What does the exam do for the kid? It doesn&amp;#39;t drive instruction - by
that time, any good teacher knows their student and is better served
by using their own &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ap-we-dont-trust-teachers/#.WJXbA99vHmE&#34;&gt;assessments&lt;/a&gt;. The college credit thing? I&amp;#39;m
skeptical. Fewer and fewer schools are giving credit for APCSA let
alone this new CS0 non major course. Blanket credit? Since full time
students pay for a range of credits, I&amp;#39;m still skeptical
here. Placement? It&amp;#39;s a course for non-majors - what exactly are you
placing out of?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Reasons not to take the exam?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If it doesn&amp;#39;t do anything for the kid, why take it
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stress of taking the exam
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are other ways of placing out of courses once in college
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Save the expense
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a general rule, I&amp;#39;m against forcing students to sit for
AP exams. At the extreme case, since we&amp;#39;ve been brainwashed to think
that a school that has lots of kids sitting for exams is good, I&amp;#39;ve
seen at least one case of a principal having all his kids sit for, and
just about all &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; AP Calculus - that is, get a 1 or 2 on the exam. This
principal had all his students take the exam, and only 2 scores were 3
or higher. This principal then parlayed his success into a higher
profile gig - he&amp;#39;s moved up in the world while setting up his students
to fail.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This follows last year&amp;#39;s announcement that code.org was &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-19-code-org-college-board.html/#.WJXbm99vHmE&#34;&gt;partnering with
the College Board&lt;/a&gt; - offering PD to teachers for free if the schools
signed up their students for the PSAT 8/9 - another meaningless
exam. So, we get teacher training light [fn::If you think that PD based
teacher training is OK, ask yourself if you want your own child&amp;#39;s
chemistry teacher to be a history teacher with a few weeks summer
training in chemistry] as long as the school pays for
the PSAT8/9 for every kid so that the kid can take yet another test
with really no value[fn::And I&amp;#39;m guessing the exam will be offered
during the day so teachers will proctor for free rather than be
allowed to, you know, teach their students.].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why should students pay for an AP exam that doesn&amp;#39;t do anything for
them? Why should Jane Q Taxpayer pay for exams that only server to
enrich the College Board.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
True, The College Board is a big player. They already have much more
influence of American High School education than they should. It&amp;#39;s
easy to climb on board the AP train for entre into our schools. The
question is, should we use positions of influence to push efforts that
might help our end but leave collateral damage to students and the public.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t doubt code.org&amp;#39;s sincerity in wanting good CS in all schools
nor the efforts or value as an advocate for CS Education. I&amp;#39;m
concerned that the desire to win big and win now is moving us in a
direction that we&amp;#39;ll regret years from now.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BS? - BA</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ba-bs/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ba-bs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t know Hunter College had computer science.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I heard that refrain more than once during my fall visits to high
schools. Part of the reason for this is due to Hunter CS&amp;#39;s low
profile and small size in spite of its high quality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part, though, was also because of some misconceptions about Computer
Science programs. I&amp;#39;d hear things like &amp;#34;but they only offer a BA not a
BS,&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;but Hunter isn&amp;#39;t an engineering school.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve come to realize that we have to do a better job educating kids as
to what can come next after high school.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure why many assume that CS has to be under
engineering. When I was applying to college, most of my choices were
Arts and Science schools offering BAs in CS. Maybe it&amp;#39;s because people don&amp;#39;t
disagregate STEM subjects. Even though it&amp;#39;s not a computer science
program many schools seem to associate FIRST robotics with computer
science. Likewise any class with even a modicum of coding becomes
computer science and as makerspaces and robotics are a percieved as
easy entry STEM classes that appear to be CS (something I&amp;#39;ll rant
about in a future post), CS becomes associated with engineering.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s easy enough to explain the difference between a BA in CS and a BS
in CS and it&amp;#39;s equally easy to show that you can have tremendous
success either way. All you have to do to show the validity of a BA in
CS is look at succesful people from places like NYU, Courant, Columbia
College (as opposed to Columbia Engineering), Cornell school of Arts
and Sciences, etc to balance successful people from the engineering schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I&amp;#39;m sure you know, I&amp;#39;m pretty high on Hunter CS and it&amp;#39;s certainly
one of the best value CS educations out there. Personally, I&amp;#39;m a big believer in a
liberal arts education but in any case, as a community we have to do a
better job educating the high schools so that graduating seniors are
best informed when deciding on their futures.

      <title>Selling out or getting a seat at the table</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/selling-out-or-a-seat-at-the-table/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/selling-out-or-a-seat-at-the-table/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The other day, a friend posited a question on Facebook (paraphrased):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If called upon, would you take a job in an administration who&amp;#39;s policies you strongly
disagreed with?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Would you go work for an administration that you reviled in order to
get a seat at the table? To try to affect change from the inside or
would you consider yourself a sellout or worse, publicly promote
positions you disagree with.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tough question.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The original question implied national level positions. I&amp;#39;ve never and
will never breath such rarefied air but I have had such experiences
closer to ground level, both with DOE projects and also in
conversations with some charter chains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My take?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyone that knows me knows that I&amp;#39;ve had various dealings with the NYC
DOE and also knows that those dealings never resulted in outcomes I
was happy with. Over my time at Stuy, I had many philosophical
differences with Tweed (a common nickname for the NYC DOE as they&amp;#39;re
housed in the old Tweed courthouse) and these were times where I tried
to play nice to have a seat at the table.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once I was at a meeting that also included a number of tech industry
heavy hitters. After the meeting, one came over to me. He knew me
by having worked with my former students. I knew him by reputation. He
asked &amp;#34;do they really want our thoughts on this or are we just here so
that they can do what they wanted in the first place and then parade us out
to say that they consulted experts in the tech industry?&amp;#34; I honestly
didn&amp;#39;t know at the time but I had my doubts as to the DOE&amp;#39;s sincerity
in being open to either my views or this CTO&amp;#39;s As it turned out, they
just did want to parade us. Later in the process, I was told in a back
room that it would be wise of me not to publicly voice my thoughts
about the direction of one particular project.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So there you have it. I was given a seat at the table but only as long
as my views mirrored the views of those in power. Not really much of a
seat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve also sat down with some charter chains - chains that I&amp;#39;ve been
more than happy to denounce publicly. Why did I take the meetings?
Mostly to find out if I was mistaken in my position and if so, maybe
I could help them. Every time I&amp;#39;ve had such a meeting, however, I&amp;#39;ve
left the table with my feelings unchanged and knowing that I would
never willingly help them as I felt their practices were harmful to
kids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In one case, I took the seat but failed to affect change. In the other
I refused the seat. I&amp;#39;ll always take a meeting and I&amp;#39;ll always work
with someone who wants to help kids and who has an open mind but I&amp;#39;ve
found that the more powerful the player, at least in education, the
more likely they are to just want confirmation of their own bias.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You might get a seat at the table but you also might end up lending
your reputation to a cause you don&amp;#39;t believe in.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Evaluate teachers like they do in the real world</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/evaluating-teachers/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 19 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/evaluating-teachers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This old article has been reposted a few times in my circles over the
past few weeks &lt;a href=&#34;http://educationnext.org/facadeofexcellence/.&#34;&gt;http://educationnext.org/facadeofexcellence/.&lt;/a&gt; It&amp;#39;s from
2003 and complains about the lack of flexibility schools had back then
with regard to hiring and salary. The article is old and out of date
and the seniority system no longer holds for hiring but it does for
lay offs. The salary scale from back then, though, is still in place.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My friend Alex  asked my thought about how we might deal with evaluating
teacher quality. I thought I&amp;#39;d share them here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Alex listed a number of commonly tried and suggested options on
teacher evaluation and why they&amp;#39;re all flawed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven&amp;#39;t asked Alex&amp;#39;s permission so I won&amp;#39;t post his list and
comments here. Instead let&amp;#39;s start with the boogeyman those that attack public
education always trot out – tenure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s get a couple of things straight - tenure is not a job for
life. For K12 teachers, it&amp;#39;s the right to due process. That means you
can&amp;#39;t be fired without cause.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I hear the free market capitalists out there already – &amp;#34;in the real
world, you&amp;#39;re an at will employee, why do teachers need this due
process?&amp;#34; - I&amp;#39;ll get to that down below. For now, let&amp;#39;s look at a few
points on tenure:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First - you can fire a tenured teacher, you just have to document your
case. This means that the supervisor has to actually do their job.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next - people can complain about rubber rooms and the time it takes to
fire one of these tenured teachers. That&amp;#39;s because the DOE won&amp;#39;t hire
sufficient hearing officers. In a recently resolved case, a friend of
mine - a terrific AP was finally returned to her post after she was
railroaded on false charges. She was in the rubber room for years. The
DOE kept delaying the process – all she wanted was to go to &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34;
since everyone knew she&amp;#39;d be exonerated - the fact that she was up on
charges at all speaks to why teachers need tenure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next - teachers don&amp;#39;t grant tenure, the administration does. Why are
all these horrible teachers being granted tenure? Stories abound of
administrators granting tenure to bad teachers so long as they
transfer to another school - who&amp;#39;s to blame here?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, the contract that establishes tenure is jointly negotiated
by the teachers union and the city - no one ever seems to complain
about the city.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next, let&amp;#39;s talk about bonuses and competition. People in the business
world take the false assumption that everyone thinks, acts, and feels like
they do. Here&amp;#39;s a surprising fact – teachers aren&amp;#39;t in it for the
money. Sure, we&amp;#39;d like to make a little more - perhaps enough to
actually  live in a decent apartment and not need a second job to make
ends meet -  but no one went into teaching to get rich. Teachers are in
it to uplift ALL their students and their school as a whole.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now let&amp;#39;s look at the model currently in vogue - value added
measures. Besides the fact that they&amp;#39;re arbitrary and don&amp;#39;t work (see
&lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-09-06-why_i_might_no_longer_be_an_effective_teacher.md/&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-10-25-effective-teacher-2.md/&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) they&amp;#39;re nothing like how people are evaluated
in the real world.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How are people evaluated in regular jobs? As far as I know, they&amp;#39;re
evaluated by their managers and bosses - possibly also by their peers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Funny thing - that&amp;#39;s how teachers used to be evaluated before all this
nonsense brought about by the &amp;#34;reformers.&amp;#34; Of course, no one will
admit to this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Did this system work? For the most part, but not entirely. Why were
there problems? Because, unlike a business, principals are not
necessarily incentivized to have the best teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Schools and principals are evaluated on ridiculous metrics - the same
standardized tests they use to evaluate teachers. To look at a small
piece – to graduate high school, kids need to pass at least one math
regents and pass three years of math classes. To be &amp;#34;college ready&amp;#34; a
student still only needs to pass one math regents and take at least
one year of geometry or trig.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This means that as far as math is concerned, a principal is
incentivized to have a math department that can get their kids through
the algebra regents. Here&amp;#39;s how this frequently plays out. The kids
take algebra over two years and then passes the exam. The kids take
geometry as their third year. They don&amp;#39;t have to pass the regents, but
it appears that in order to increase a student&amp;#39;s chances of passing
that exam, classes don&amp;#39;t teach proof - the most important and hardest
part of the class. Why not? Because it&amp;#39;s easier to pass the exam by
learning most of the other stuff.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here we have a school where the incentive is to hire teachers that can
teach to the algebra regents and that&amp;#39;s about it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s at a school with a low performing population. In a higher
performing school, the kids will do well on the standardized tests
regardless of teacher quality so there&amp;#39;s no incentive to hire the
best. Even if that&amp;#39;s what they want to do, there&amp;#39;s no way to know if
they&amp;#39;re actually doing it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back to why teachers need due process. Since principals aren&amp;#39;t held
accountable in any reasonable way, teachers can&amp;#39;t be. The end result
is that teachers are subject to abuses by principals. I myself was
once brought up on bogus charges raised by a principal (not a Stuy
one) who wanted to make trouble. Without due process, I would be out
of a job. So would many others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The answer? To me it&amp;#39;s figure out how to hold principals
accountable. In Alex&amp;#39;s Facebook post he  mentions evaluation by
college and workforce success but that has a slow feedback loop. The
truth is, education does have a slow feedback loop. Schools, however,
exist for along time and principals should have tenure periods of more than
just a couple of years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My feelings? Why not look at graduates succeeding in college or on the
tax rolls? This wouldn&amp;#39;t be perfect but it would be a start. While NY
can&amp;#39;t count on private universities sharing accurate information in a
timely manner there should be a way of tracking if a high school
graduate is enrolled in a SUNY or CUNY one, two, three, or four
semesters after graduation. Create a baseline for a school and start
from there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If principals were actually accountable in a reasonable
way they&amp;#39;d have incentive to have the best teachers. Then we can get
back to the old system which was indeed the way the &amp;#34;real world&amp;#34;
works.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Science Talent Search winners do not a great school make</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/dont-focus-on-sts/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/dont-focus-on-sts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Over on Facebook, my Alma Mater and long time employer, Stuyvesant
High School seems to be making a big push to up it&amp;#39;s Regeneron Science
Talent Search game. For those of you who aren&amp;#39;t familiar, that&amp;#39;s the
latest incarnation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneron_Science_Talent_Search&#34;&gt;the Westinghouse Science Talent Search&lt;/a&gt; from
back in my day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It seems that Stuyvesant hasn&amp;#39;t had that many semi finalists,
finalists, and winners over the past few years and isn&amp;#39;t happy about
it. The result is a bunch of social media reminding us of old winners
and trying to raise funds to get us back to the glory days.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;d rather they spent there time, energy, and money elsewhere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I was a young teacher, I was enamored with those types of
results. When my kids did well on a USACO competition, for example, I
felt pretty good about myself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then one day, I had an epiphany. I was looking over the results of a
big USACO competition. My kids came in 4th, 5th, and I think
fifteenth. I was feeling pretty good about myself but then I realized
that Dan, Evan, and Jon - my three top scorers would probably have
done just fine without me. Sure, I do believe that I was able to help
them in their growth as both computer scientists and as people but
they were already off the charts smart.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The same is true about the Science Talent Search (STS) winners. A
friend of mine ran Stuyvesant&amp;#39;s math research class for a number of
years. He had a pretty impressive string of finalists and winners. How
did he do it?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Identify Stuyvesant&amp;#39;s top talent - the ones already most likely to
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
succeed in the STS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Pawn them off on a lab or professor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Stuy class, by and large, did little or nothing for these kids yet
we would hold them up as shining examples of how wonderful we were.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I had my epiphany, I started designing my intro class and
focusing my efforts on the whole school population. The results?
Scores of people succeeding in tech who never would have considered it
otherwise.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While my super high achievers have indeed gone  on to successful lives
and careers, some of my most successful graduates, by any number of
measures have been the students who would otherwise have gotten lost
in the crowd at Stuy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The truth is, many of Stuyvesant&amp;#39;s STS winners would have been STS
winners regardless of where they went. We may or may not have helped
them along the way but STS results are not the measure of a great
school.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Improving a school, any school, for all its students might not help in
those bogus national ratings but that really should be what we&amp;#39;re
about.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Hunter CS is so important to NYC</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hunter-cs-important/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hunter-cs-important/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
If you know me you know that my morning reads include a visit over to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://avc.com&#34;&gt;avc.com&lt;/a&gt;, Today, &lt;a href=&#34;http://avc.com/2016/10/cranes/&#34;&gt;Fred&amp;#39;s post&lt;/a&gt; talked about development and progress,
evolution, if you would, in the city. Although not directly related,
it got me thinking about gentrification.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To me, gentrification all too often seems to result in pushing out
people and business that were there during the hard times.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We don&amp;#39;t need to force out long time residents that can no longer make
rent - we need to uplift communities with pathways to towards greater
economic opportunity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Those of us in CS Education, each in our own way, are trying to help
build those pathways.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Return readers know that I&amp;#39;ve ranted about some of the popular magic
bullets. I&amp;#39;ve periodically talked about my concerns over code schools
but even at their best they represent a workforce program for the well
to do. I&amp;#39;ve also talked about efforts like P-Tech which sound good,
but besides the fact that &lt;a href=&#34;https://garyrubinstein.wordpress.com/2016/10/06/p-tech-principal-responds/&#34;&gt;the emperor has no clothes&lt;/a&gt;, is the school
really preparing kids for opportunities in their own neighborhoods or
in data centers far from home?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are some workforce programs like &lt;a href=&#34;https://perscholas.org/&#34;&gt;Per Scholas&lt;/a&gt; that I really like
and respect but they&amp;#39;re limited in what they can do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What does that leave us with? The traditional path – college.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In terms of tech, New York City has some amazing colleges. You ask
most people, they&amp;#39;ll come back with NYU, Columbia. Great institutions
but &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; expensive.  Not everyone can afford $75,000 a year and
not everyone can afford to go into hundreds of thousands of debt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is why Hunter CS is so important. Actually CUNY but I can only
affect my little corner of the world.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hunter College has a really nice CS program and department. It&amp;#39;s small
and has flown under the radar but it&amp;#39;s one of the reasons I came over
to Hunter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of my responsibilities at Hunter is to develop our new honors CS
program and to connect all of  Hunter CS to the tech sector in NY.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven&amp;#39;t written much about what&amp;#39;s been going on but that will change
int the months to come. Suffice it to say that to uplift our
communities we need real, affordable educational opportunities and in
terms of tech, education that leads to real opportunities in
our city&amp;#39;s tech sector.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m convinced that Hunter College can be a game changer for the wealth
of young talent we have in New York and for our tech sector.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Computational Thinkers in Scotland</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/scotland/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/scotland/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m way behind on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://cacm.acm.org/&#34;&gt;Communications of the ACM&lt;/a&gt;. I generally only read
them when I use my trainer in the mornings and with summer running and
outside riding, I&amp;#39;m still on the December 2015 issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This morning, I read a viewpoint by Jeremy Scott and Alan Bundy on &lt;a href=&#34;http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/12/194638-creating-a-new-generation-of-computational-thinkers/abstract&#34;&gt;a
program in Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;#39;re an ACM member, and if you&amp;#39;re a CS
practitioner, student, academic, or teacher you should be, you can read the piece for details.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Me? I noticed a number of similarities between what Bundy and Scott
described and efforts here in the USA including some of the red flags.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not here to talk about the program described in detail or their
successes and failures. I don&amp;#39;t have enough information to fairly
comment on that. I&amp;#39;m here in my usual role of curmudgeon to highlight
common red flags that if unheeded could cost all of us the opportunity
to get really great CS Ed to all of our students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One red flag right away were a number of references to the program
being curriculum and materials driven, not teacher driven. The
viewpoint states that materials &amp;#34;were designed to be used by even
non-specialist teachers.&amp;#34; We see the same thing here in the USA and
not just in CS Ed. Teaching overall is being devalued with the elite
pushing programs that handcuff good teachers to a script (which leads
students towards &amp;#34;success&amp;#34; in passing a nonsense standardized exam)
all the while sending their own kids to elite private schools with
knowledgeable teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know i didn&amp;#39;t want my kids to be taught chemistry history or any
other subject by a teacher that hasn&amp;#39;t studied the content yet here we
go saying it&amp;#39;s okay for CS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The counter argument is that we have to do something now and we&amp;#39;ll do
better later. We all go in with the best of intentions but more often
than not, once a politician has their sound bite and once a cheap
apparent solution is in place, it&amp;#39;s good enough and we&amp;#39;re done. I
ranted about that a while back both &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-03-04-expedient-vs-good.html/#.V-5UqN9vGAk&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-07-learning-takes-time.html/#.V-5Uot9vGAk&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. To their credit,
Bundy and Scott talk a bit about this concern in the piece.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The piece also said &amp;#34;It is also necessary to employ a pedagogy that is
informed by the latest research into the most effective ways to teach
computing.&amp;#34; This sounds good but the truth is, education research
doesn&amp;#39;t have the best reputation among educators. Last month, I
asked one of the best math teachers around what was being bandied
about as best practices in math education according to &amp;#34;the
research?&amp;#34; He basically said &amp;#34;the research says do &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fad du jour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
but that doesn&amp;#39;t work for me so I just do &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;actually good technique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over the years, I&amp;#39;ve spoken to many teachers and by and large the best
ones discredit &amp;#34;the research.&amp;#34; Of course, my comment will be
discredited by ed researchers saying that &amp;#34;you&amp;#39;re just giving
anecdotes&amp;#34; but then, if I did the same thing while employed as a
researcher, did a couple of surveys and submitted it for publication,
then it would be &amp;#34;research.&amp;#34; So much of teaching is a craft and the
truth is, practitioners know best.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Related to this is authentication by citing authority. Particularly
dangerous in our field because many people with little to no real
background in teaching CS are anointed as experts and thought leaders
(see this post: &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-10-26-self-appointed-experts.html/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). In this case, the viewpoint cites Cameron
Fadjo. I&amp;#39;ve only met Cameron once or twice and he seems like a sharp
guy but when he was given the post of Director of Software Engineering
for NYC, according to his linked in profile, he had neither taught k12
nor had any real CS background.  This is of course the profile of many
CS Education thought leaders.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My overall take. It sounds like just like here, Scotland has people
trying to make a difference and trying to do good. It also sounds like
they&amp;#39;re falling into the same traps and pitfalls as we are on this
side of the Atlantic.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Impostor Syndrome - I&#39;m not good enough</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to comment on these tweets for a while:
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I went to high school with some scary smart people. Never made math team.

&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stan, of course, is one of the most talented people I know.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It reminded me of a conversation I had with my colleague and friend
Jim last year. I had just recieved an email from a former student
turned friend. We were trying to find some time to catch up.  I told
Jim I had just heard from this young lady and Jim replied &amp;#34;I remember
her, she&amp;#39;s awesome. Really smart.&amp;#34; I mention this because the
individual we were talking about, while to us, extremely talented in
addition to being just a terrific person spent much of her career
living in self doubt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Meantime, I was having a conversation with another friend and the
topic turned to impostor syndrome and the desire to make it a thing of
the past.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Problem is, I don&amp;#39;t know if that will ever be the case. I&amp;#39;m
approaching 50 and have a career of good work behind me but I still
find myself questioning my credentials, work, and ability. Then I realized I wasn&amp;#39;t alone
when I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RobertTalbert&#34;&gt;Robert Talbert&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://rtalbert.org/blog/2016/tenure-second-time&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about his going through
the tenure process for a second time and &amp;#34;learning through this process
that I have not outrun impostor syndrome and probably never will.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stan&amp;#39;s tweets tell part of the story. When we surround ourselves with
smart, accomplished people, we sometimes feel we don&amp;#39;t measure
up. I&amp;#39;ve found that for the most part, the extremely accomplished
people I&amp;#39;ve worked with are very unassuming and low key. They seem to
operate assuming that  everyone else is at least as capable and quick as
they. I recall &lt;a href=&#34;http://paulgraham.com/articles.html&#34;&gt;Paul Graham&lt;/a&gt; talking about this in an essay but
I don&amp;#39;t remember which one. The problem is, if you don&amp;#39;t understand
their sincerity, you end up feeling even more inadequate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It gets worse when we start comparing ourselves to some unreal
composite. I remember feeling pretty stupid back when I was younger
comparing myself with others. The problem was that I clearly didn&amp;#39;t
measure up to the best math kid, or the best computer kid, the best
fencer, the best violinist, etc. Now, the best math kid might have
been a lousy athlete and the best fencer, a so so mathematician, but
to me, I was comparing myself with this composite super human. No
wonder I never measured up. Eventually, though, I realized three
things. First, there&amp;#39;s always someone better at something and always
someone worse. Second, that&amp;#39;s not the true value of ones worth as a
person, and three, I bring some good stuff to the table and I should
be (and am) content with that
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, I still struggle with impostor syndrome but at the end of the day,
it just serves as a reminder to look back on what I&amp;#39;ve done and what
I&amp;#39;ve learned in the process.  I start out in question but in the end,
leave confident. Maybe the trick isn&amp;#39;t to eliminate impostor syndrome
but rather to understand and contain it. We don&amp;#39;t want to live in fear
and anxiety but both are useful emotions when we control them and not
the reverse.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s probably good when we question ourselves and re-evaluate our
positions - we just have to make sure as we&amp;#39;re bringing new people
into the tech fold that we foster acceptance and confidence  and when
impostor syndrome sets in that it can be channeled into a positive
and not scare people away.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Federal Aid for Code Schools - is this a good thing?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/fed-aid-for-code-schools/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/fed-aid-for-code-schools/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I saw this headline earlier today: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/coding-bootcamps-just-got-a-big-boost.html&#34;&gt;The U.S. Just Made a Bold Move to Improve Diversity in Tech&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The article talks about a program by which a number of code schools
will be able to accept federal student aid. I don&amp;#39;t know if we&amp;#39;re
talking student loans or  grants but I&amp;#39;m not sure it matters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The headline sounds great. I&amp;#39;m not so sure that this is a good thing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My thinking&amp;#39;s evolved over the years but right now, everything tells
me that public funds and for profit education don&amp;#39;t mix.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What we, more often than not, end up with is a cash cow for a private concern.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Example one: The edTPA - a required exam for teacher licensing, at
least in NY. Prospective teachers pay hundreds of dollars to pass this
gatekeeper. Pearson, a private company (and not even an American one)
is essentially in charge of teacher licensing. They make the
assessments, they grade them, they decide who passes. A foreign
company is deciding who teaches our kids and at great expense to those
prospective teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;d be much better off going back to the old days. To become a
teacher, you had to pass through &amp;#34;The board of examiners.&amp;#34; Basically,
to get your permanent license you had to do an oral defense. Teachers
would be placed in a room of principals, supervisors, and master
teachers for an open grilling. It was cheaper and MUCH more
effective.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Example two: The PSAT 8/9, PSAT, and SAT. These are exams that tell us
one thing: how kids will do on future PSAT and SAT tests. They&amp;#39;re not
good predictors of college success but the college board (a non-profit
in name only) has convinced us, or at least &amp;#34;convinced&amp;#34; our
politicians of the exams importance. So, rather than having
individuals make a choice as to whether or not to take these exams, NY
forks over who knows how much money per year so that our kids can take
a test with the belief that the exam will mystically make them college
ready. To make matters worse, students lose a day of instruction and
teachers have to proctor the exam instead of teaching.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Example three: Common core tests. Made in secret, graded in secret
with cut off scores designed after the fact. Absolutely no educational
value but once again, public funds flow freely into testing companies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problem is that these private concerns never really have to show
results and they&amp;#39;re never held accountable and since the money we pay
them is hidden in city and state budgets, the taxpayer is none the wiser.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what about code schools?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In a similar vein, money will flow from the government to the code
schools. The question is, do they really have the secret sauce.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have lots of friends who run and work in code schools and have met
many more. Some code schools are trying to really educate and some
not so much. In any case, let&amp;#39;s take a look.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You frequently hear about the success stories but for every one of
those, you can also find a manager talking about the fact that the
code school graduate can&amp;#39;t do anything other than ape the narrow tool
that they were exposed to in the three or so months at the code
school. So, the truth is that results are probably a mixed bag.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is this good? Well, when you consider the typical code school MO it
really isn&amp;#39;t.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To attend a for profit code school you have to not only afford the
tuition but also be able to sustain yourself for the duration of the
program. That makes most code schools options for the well to do -
those already well positioned for success.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then they make the candidates go through pre-work – frequently online
course work. So, before you even step into a code school, they know
you&amp;#39;re likely going to succeed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once in, they train the candidates in a narrow slice of tech. I&amp;#39;ve
talked to a number of code school leaders about that. I&amp;#39;ve asked how
well the kids would be able to adapt given the constraints of their 3
month or so training. The typical answer was that the candidate could
just re-up and pay again to learn the next limited time only skill.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Should taxpayer dollars go to this? Probably not. There&amp;#39;s no
indication that code schools can provide meaningful long lasting
education to even those who are best prepared to learn on their
own. Whats&amp;#39; more, we haven&amp;#39;t seen evidence that they have the answers
for the under-served. Combine that with government&amp;#39;s history of not
keeping an eye on and not holding accountable private education
providers, I think we&amp;#39;re just setting up a new line of corporate
welfare that will, on the surface help some but it is in no way the
answer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Too often public/private means that the private entity gets the money
and the public gets stuck holding the bag. Better would be to have
tech companies foot the bill. Some coding schools already do
this. Tech companies that are happy with coding school graduates can
finance the program.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What we should be doing is focusing on things like community
colleges. Organizations that are supposed to be real, long term,
community centers. With moderate tweaking, there&amp;#39;s no reason why a
community college, not to mention 4 year schools, couldn&amp;#39;t provide far
superior preparation than even the best code school.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ed Disruption - why it&#39;s different</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ed-disrupt-why-diff/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ed-disrupt-why-diff/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Earlier today I read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eliothorowitz.com/blog/2016/07/25/innovate-vs-appropriate/&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/eliothorowitz&#34;&gt;Eliot Horowitz&lt;/a&gt;, founder and CTO of MongoDB.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Eliot titled the post &amp;#34;Innovate vs Appropriate&amp;#34; and talks about the
importance of knowing when to come up with something new vs when to
use the accepted tool, technique, or method. Eliot, of course is
discussing this as it applies to MongoDB and it&amp;#39;s well worth a read
but it got me thinking about the ever popular need to &amp;#34;disrupt&amp;#34;
education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve witnessed this disruption or Ed Reform for the last decade
plus. The basic notion that public education isn&amp;#39;t working so we need
to disrupt things. We&amp;#39;ve suffered through:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Vouchers
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Charters
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Online &amp;#34;learning&amp;#34; replacing teachers
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teach for America and other temp type efforts
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Merit pay
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
VAM for teacher evaluation
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and more
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These disruptions are brought to you by your friendly neighborhood
billionaire &amp;#34;philanthropist&amp;#34; or your politicians.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By and large, they haven&amp;#39;t worked.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bill Gates got us to close down community schools and create small
ones. While we did need more small schools, overall it didn&amp;#39;t work
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marc-epstein/small-schools-miracle-or_b_2641400.html?utm_hp_ref=new-york&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/06/09/how-much-bill-gatess-disappointing-small-schools-effort-really-cost/%0A&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). VAM teacher evaluation is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/06/09/how-much-bill-gatess-disappointing-small-schools-effort-really-cost/%0A&#34;&gt;arbitrary and capricious&lt;/a&gt;,
merit pay has &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/ravitch-why-merit-pay-for-teachers-doesnt-work/2011/03/29/AFn5w9yB_blog.html&#34;&gt;never worked&lt;/a&gt;, nor does the &lt;a href=&#34;http://educationnext.org/online-charters-mostly-dont-work-forum-virtual-schools-greg-richmond/&#34;&gt;online thing&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, charter
schools by and large &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nea.org/home/32999.htm&#34;&gt;don&amp;#39;t do better&lt;/a&gt; than public schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rather than saving our schools, these efforts have lowered teacher
morale and done little for our most vulnerable children.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what&amp;#39;s the difference between ed disruption and the tech world?
Well, for starters, those disrupting education totally ignore the very
advice that Eliot posted about today.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Disruption to and of our public schools hasn&amp;#39;t been a matter
appropriating what works and innovating what needs to be innovated but rather
a playground for pet projects of politicians and well meaning rich
folk.  Rather than looking at something simple that works, like, say,
smaller class sizes, we get computerized testing. Instead of
experienced teachers, we get inexperienced newbies that leave after
their commitment is up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why the difference? It hit me while reading Eliot&amp;#39;s post. When a
founder is &amp;#34;disrupting&amp;#34; he has skin in the game - it&amp;#39;s his company -
sink or swim. Not so for education reformers. Politicians merely need
to be re-elected.Sso as long as something looks good short term, it is
good. Those who disrupt schools are never held accountable. We got
small schools and VAM from among other places, Bill Gates. He admitted
his reforms didn&amp;#39;t work but was there any penalty for disrupting so
many lives? Nope. For politicians, it&amp;#39;s the same story. As Mayor Mike
Bloomberg once said &amp;#34;If they don&amp;#39;t like my education policy, they can
boo me at parades.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Can we fix this? Sure, but not unless those forcing the changes have
real skin in the game. Will it happen? I&amp;#39;m not holding my breath.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hillary and Student Loans</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hillary-loans/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hillary-loans/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday I read over Hillary&amp;#39;s briefing on her initiative on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2016/06/27/hillary-clintons-initiative-on-technology-innovation/&#34;&gt;Technology and Innovation&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A lot of it sounds good but, at least for the education piece, I have
my doubts. My feeling is that she&amp;#39;s pretty much aligned with the
current administration education wise and the current administration
has been as bad if not worse than the previous with respect to public
education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I have issues with some of the education pieces and very much
like some of the others, I don&amp;#39;t want to get into that today. I want
to focus on one specific part of her plan. The part that defers
college debt for up to 3 years for founders and entrepreneurs. This
sounds great but is this really a good thing?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some initial responses from the education community is &amp;#34;what about
young teachers, don&amp;#39;t they deserve some help on college debt? What
about nurses?…&amp;#34; and of course they&amp;#39;re right. On the other hand, I
don&amp;#39;t want people to go into teaching for 2 or 3 years just to get
some debt relief benefit and then jump ship. That&amp;#39;s the Teach for
America model that I feel has become so harmful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But again, that&amp;#39;s not where I&amp;#39;m going with this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s start with &amp;#34;who are these founders?&amp;#34; I don&amp;#39;t have any hard data
but I have read a couple of recent pieces that indicate that founders
right out of college are typically from well to do backgrounds. This
of course makes sense. A kid up to his or her eyes in debt from a poor
background. No savings, no property, likely a family, that is siblings
and parents who are also treading water can ill afford to take a big
financial risk. A kid from a monied family? Much more so.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This alone makes Hillary&amp;#39;s plan a boon for the wealthy but not so
much for the people we need to give a hand up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next, this plan talks about the founders and only says it will
&amp;#34;explore similar incentives&amp;#34;  for early employees, citing &amp;#34;10 to 20.&amp;#34;
This doesn&amp;#39;t seem right to me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now let&amp;#39;s look further into the benefits. I don&amp;#39;t know what the
success and failure rates are for startups. I&amp;#39;ve seen a bunch of
figures including:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
90% of startups fail within the first three years
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Three out of four startups fail
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of 10 startups, 3 or 4 totally fail, 3 or 4 break even and the
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
others turn a profit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know where the truth lies but I&amp;#39;d imagine that the success
rate for startup by a recent college graduate, wet behind the ears is
probably higher than for a more season professionals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hillary&amp;#39;s plan defers debt for up to three years. If any of the
failure numbers cited above are near correct it means that these kids
will have burned through up to three years with the experience of a
failed startup to show for it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve always advised my students, all things being equal, start at a
big or mid size company, develop your chops, learn how they do it,
further build out your network, and then go out and do your
thing. Most kids are better served not going directly from college to
their first startup.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So there it is. A plan that makes for great &amp;#34;press release&amp;#34; but is it
really addressing the issues?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Navajo Math Circles</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/navajo-circles/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/navajo-circles/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, I saw the New York Premiere of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zalafilms.com/navajo/&#34;&gt;Navajo Math Circles&lt;/a&gt;, a
documentary on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mathcircles.org/&#34;&gt;Math Circle&lt;/a&gt; put in place to support and enrich the
currently under-served community in the Navajo educational system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At their core, Math Circles are math outreach and enrichment
programs. I&amp;#39;m most familiar with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nymathcircle.org/&#34;&gt;New York Math Circle&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m friends
with many of their teachers and organizers and my son took part in
their summer program for a couple of years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over in the southwest, these Math Circles have been bringing together
students, frequently across great distances each day to explore
problem solving and creativity through mathematics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As someone who&amp;#39;s worked hard to bring educational opportunities to the
have nots, I love the program. Some of the highlights include the kids
working on open ended problems, focusing on process and techniques
more than specific results, working both collaboratively but also
developing self sufficiency, and more. I also love the fact that
they&amp;#39;ve started teacher math circles to help to bring some of that
math circle magic to the everyday classroom.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I enjoyed the film and recommend you check it out to see what&amp;#39;s
possible and I want to share my two big takeaways.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, early on in the film, one of the people running the program
talked about developing a math enrichment program through and with
Navajo traditions and culture. This is HUGE and I feel it&amp;#39;s something
we&amp;#39;re losing. America is so diverse from coast to coast and here in
New York City you can see radically different ways of life living
right across the street from each other. Everyone pays lip service to
&amp;#34;making the work interesting and relevant to the student&amp;#34; but few
people walk the walk. These folk do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Second, I left the documentary with a sour taste in my mouth. Not
because of the program but because the Navajo Math Circle project and
projects like it are scraping together what little resources they can
to try to do what the school systems should be doing to begin with.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As we move to scripted lessons, national standards, curricula dictated
or at least influenced by large private concerns and standardized
tests, our schools are moving further and further away from community
and local culture.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the documentary, one student pointed out that in math class, they
have to use the textbook. They learn the process and then have to
solve the problems. In Math Circle, there are no textbooks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Afterwards, the students in from the Math Circle did some Q&amp;amp;A. I asked
them to elaborate - what&amp;#39;s the difference between there Math Circle
experiences and their in school ones. I got:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Math Circle is fun!!!!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think that says it all.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know many great teachers who try to bring culture and community to
their classes. One of my son&amp;#39;s best teachers, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.heinemann.com/authors/828.aspx&#34;&gt;Paula Rogovin&lt;/a&gt; did it all
the time. Many of my friends and colleagues try to do so as well but
the powers that be make it harder and harder.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Until we win back public education it&amp;#39;s important to support programs
like Math Circles (and, if I do say so myself, programs like our own
&lt;a href=&#34;http://cstuy.org&#34;&gt;CSTUY&lt;/a&gt;) and it&amp;#39;s also critical that we work to try to bring community
and culture to our regular classes.
&lt;/p&gt;
