        Well, we just delivered the last formal piece of instruction for the summer intensive. Writing this post between visits to breakout rooms as the cohort works on their final projects.  Tomorrow and Thursday will be presentation time. Each group will give spend thirty minutes teaching us all about some topic in CS along with the plan for how we could teach the topic to our kids. We&#39;ve got a few more things to talk about as a group but it&#39;s mostly time to sit back and enjoy the show.

        Time for some thoughts after week 2.  Since this is the inaugural edition of our program and there was no way to really know what the cohort would be like we&#39;ve been adjusting on the fly. This was expected but we&#39;re finally starting to settle in. We&#39;re still finding more zoom heavy days but as we move towards the end of our data structures segment there should be fewer of those.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        Time for an update on our NY State Teacher Certification Program.  We kicked off on Monday. Twenty two students working with three instructors from 9:00 - 3:00 every day. We&#39;ve been using a combination of synchronous with Zoom and async using Slack and GitHub discussions. We&#39;re using GitHub as our main platform.  Day 0 was very Zoom heavy but we&#39;re trying to balance one big Zoom session a day combined with other work so as to minimize fatigue.

        As many of you know, the CS Education programs I designed here at Hunter were finally approved by NY State late last year. We&#39;re planning to get started this summer. I&#39;ve received many questions about the program and will write up the details here sooner or later but one question I frequently get is &#34;will it be offered online?&#34; This is also something I&#39;ve been asked more than once internal to Hunter.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        Every few years the experts give us some new magic bullet, some new teaching fad research based pedagogical technique. Teachers are trained in it, forced to use it - frequently as a one size fits all. If we do, we&#39;re good teachers, if we don&#39;t we get the dreaded ineffective on our annual ratings.  I was reminded of this when reading Mark Guzdial&#39;s recent blog post on things he got wrong in Computing Education.

        Just saw this: Evaluation metric idea: take snapshots of students&#39; grades each week (specifically, the grade they actually see in your LMS). How well do these correlate with your final assigned grade? Were students getting good estimates?

        Now that high school seniors have all committed to their respective colleges I though I&#39;d share some information on Hunter&#39;s incoming Daedalus (honors CS) cohort.  I joke about the first cohort saying that nobody applied to the program. That&#39;s kind of true. I jointed Hunter a little over three years ago in late January. That was after high school seniors had already applied to college and at that time the program didn&#39;t exist.

Marie desJardins, Gloria Townsend, Mark Guzdial, and Blair Taylor. I wasn&#39;t at the first timer&#39;s lunch where Townsend spoke so I won&#39;t talk at all about that keynote.  I&#39;m also not going to summarize the talks. Andy Ko wrote up a terrific summary of his SIGCSE experience and did a much better job giving overviews to the keynotes than I ever could so I&#39;ll just refer you to Andy&#39;s blog post.

        The theme of this year&#39;s To Code and Beyond was Computational Thinking. Mark Guzdial gave the keynote. While the talk isn&#39;t currently online, check out this talk that Mark gave last March. It&#39;s not the same but the second halves are and well worth a look.  In the first half, Mark talked about other types of &#34;thinking.&#34; Scientific thinking, engineering thinking and even historical thinking. All had a good amount of overlap with both each other and with computational thinking even as we haven&#39;t yet settled on what computational thinking actually is.
