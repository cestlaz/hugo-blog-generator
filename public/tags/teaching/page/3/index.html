        One of my laments on teaching computer science is that students are rarely taught and given the chance to develop good programming practices. There&#39;s usually not enough time. Beginners work on small &#34;toys&#34; which don&#39;t lend themselves to good software development practices and later on, there&#39;s so much other material like algorithms, data structures etc. to teach and learn that programming practices usually amount to lines like:   &#34;Make sure to comment your code.

        I really didn&#39;t know what to expect at the Creativity, Customization, and Ownership: Game Design in Bootstrap: Algebra session. I&#39;ve been a big fan of Bootstrep for years and looking at the authors, Emmanuel Schanzer&#39;s been a freind forever. I&#39;ve never met Shriram Krishnamurthi in person but am looking forward to it. We&#39;ve traded emails and blog comments. I&#39;d like to consider him a friend and I certainly respect him and his work even though we frequently disagree around the edges.

        I&#39;ve been having fun with this years Advent of Code competition. So far, I&#39;ve been able to keep up but with I expect that to change in another couple of days since I&#39;ll be traveling for the weekend.  After solving a problem, I like looking over some of the other solutions on the Advent of Code subreddit. Even with similar agorithmic solutions there&#39;s a decent amount of variation in the actual code and solutions in different languages can look radically different.

        Yesterday I was one of the judges at StuyHacks. A one day hackathon at Stuyvesant run by and organized by the students. I don&#39;t have attendee stats but there were kids from all over the city and at least one team from New Jersey. The youngest student that I met was in sixth grade and the oldest were high school seniors. The judging was at the end but I decided to stop by earlier to see how the hackers were doing.

        We all love interesting problems. The trouble is that it&#39;s hard to find suitably interesting problems for students when they&#39;re just learning the basics. In the very beginning the problems practically dictate the solution:    loop over a list and add all the elements or calculate the sum of a    list of integers.    Determine if number is prime    Convert a word into pig-Latin    It&#39;s not that there&#39;s no thought involved in solving these but the students already know the mechanics of solving these by hand so it&#39;s a direct translation into a program.

        I just read Jeff Yearout&#39;s recent post titled The Beginner&#39;s Garden of Concepts. Not directly related but it got me thinking about programming idioms.  I&#39;ve been using the phrase &#34;programming idiom&#34; for years to describe a short useful recurring code construct. I didn&#39;t realize that it was officially &#34;a thing&#34; until doing a web search on the phrase years later.  As our students grow from newbies on I think it&#39;s helpful for them to see recurring and related patterns and programming idioms gives us a name to apply to many beginner patterns.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        Last year I wrote about repl.it, an online IDE that supports multiple languages. At the time it had some rudimentary classroom support and since I started using it, repl.it has become better and better. I used it last year with my class because I had to start the year in a lab where I couldn&#39;t easily install my own software. I&#39;ll continue to use repl.it - mostly for it&#39;s ability to schedule publish and manage assignments but when possible, I like having my students work locally.

        With the school year starting I was originally planning on writing about my class rules.  Instead I think I&#39;ll riff on Alfred Thompson&#39;s post today titled Curriculum is Hard. I&#39;m guessing I found curriculum design and development daunting decades ago but at this point in my career it&#39;s something I enjoy. In any event, Alfred got me to thinking - when is a curriculum your own?  If you grab a curriculum complete with lesson plans, assignments; the whole kit and caboodle and you use it verbatim it&#39;s clearly not your curriculum.

        I got an email from a friend the other day. Among other things, he mentioned that he would be teaching APCS-A for the first time this year. He&#39;s a little trepidatious. He knows his stuff but he hasn&#39;t really done much using Java.  I was going to respond in an email but thought I might share here instead.   TL;DR - for all you APCS teachers who are new or new to Java - learn your core CS, lean on your resources and support and it&#39;s OK to tell your kids &#34;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ll get back to you.
