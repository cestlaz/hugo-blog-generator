Preamble
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve never accepted a guest post before but when my friend and long
time colleague JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver said he had something to say I
was all for it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
JonAlf&amp;#39;s one of the best teachers I know - he started at Brandeis HS and
has been at Stuy forever. Really sharp guy, great teacher, and really
perceptive. When he has something to say it&amp;#39;s 100% worth listening
to. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To JonAlf - since I know this is one of my blog posts you&amp;#39;ll actually
read - you should set up a blog of your own. The community would be
all the better for it.
&lt;/p&gt;

Missing out on a great opportunity in education

&lt;p&gt;
In the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, educators across the nation are
adapting to remote learning. I’ve watched my colleagues work hard
putting together plans on how to deliver content, engage students and
assess their learning. Some, like myself, are combining multiple tools
in order to achieve these goals while others are using a single
platform for it all. I count myself lucky that the administration in
my school has given its teachers the leeway to select their own tools
instead of forcing a single platform on us. Last week, as I was
thinking through what my plan was going to be, a particular thought
kept nagging at me:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We are facing an amazing opportunity in the world of education. Think
of how many lessons, worksheets, notes, examples, etc. are being put
out in some electronic form.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-5&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Students will (hopefully) have access to the materials for their
classes, and teachers in the same school may also be able to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-6&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will never be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about the teacher three states away that’s struggling to find good resources or new problems?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-7&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will never be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about the student in a different district, perhaps one that has
shut down entirely, who just wants to learn and do some work in order
to help fill the days?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-8&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will never be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The internet gives us the ability to put all of these resources out
there to the public, and it pains me to think about how much of this
work is going to be hidden behind one platform or another. So many of
the educational technologies make it very easy to post work for your
class and very hard, if not impossible, to share it with other people
(you’re school doesn’t also have a license for XYZ?, sorry).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, there are many teachers out there that have no choice, they
are being mandated to use whatever the school decrees. There are
others, perhaps the less technically savvy, that are going to use
whatever they can get trained on quickly. We’re all running a 2 minute
drill and working with what we have. I get that, and it is not a
teacher’s job to provide materials for everyone. That being said, If
you have the knowhow, or would like to learn, there are ways to make
your work publicly available. Last summer Mike and I ran a session at
the CSTA conference on using GitHub for just this purpose, and hope to
run a workshop on it this summer (For those interested, I made a brief
tutorial about how to do this.
&lt;/p&gt;

For my part, I’ll be putting everything on my class websites, if you
need any ideas for intro to cs in python here’s my class:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stuycs.org/intro1-dw/&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stuycs.org/intro1-dw/&#34;&gt;https://www.stuycs.org/intro1-dw/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If your’re looking for advanced cs,
I’ve got a computer graphics class here:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stuycs.org/graphics-dw/&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stuycs.org/graphics-dw/&#34;&gt;https://www.stuycs.org/graphics-dw/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
