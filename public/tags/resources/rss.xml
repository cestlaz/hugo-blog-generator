      <title>Awesome Cs Revisited</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Saw this tweet the other day so I though I would try to plug the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education&#34;&gt;Awesome CS Education&lt;/a&gt; list I started on GitHub:
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/csteachers?src=hash&#34;&gt;#csteachers&lt;/a&gt;...didn&amp;#39;t I see a list of CS teacher blogs here recently?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Pam Whitlock (@PamWhitlock1) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/PamWhitlock1/status/910662628757864448&#34;&gt;September 21, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To answer the tweet, the closet thing I know to a list is &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alfredtwo&#34;&gt;Alfred
Thompson&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s blog roll which is actually a post he wrote on his blog
in 2012. Unfortunately his list can be hard to find and is somewhat
out of date.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The idea of an &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34; list is publicly hosting a simple site that
is community driven and anyone can suggest additions and edits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I put up a starter &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and a few people have contributed but I&amp;#39;d love
to get more people involved. Awesome lists have a number of advantages
over other repositories.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unlike blog posts, the site is easy to find.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unlike private mailing lists or Facebook, anyone can see the content.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyone can suggest additions (although you need to create a Github
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
account).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyone can download or fork the site.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s essentially plain text and is easy to edit (just read the
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education/blob/master/contributing.org&#34;&gt;contribution guide&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, there you have it. If you have a blog or resource to share please
submit a pull request. Over time this could be a terrific single
starting point for educators to get to a wealth of resources.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Community Curated List of CS Education Resources</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/awesome-cs/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/awesome-cs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
One of the things I mentioned in my post on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-educators-stackexchange/&#34;&gt;CS Educators
StackExchange&lt;/a&gt; was the fragmentation of resources for CS Educators. My
friend and fellow CS teacher Ben pointed out that this is appropriate
as we&amp;#39;re so young as a community. He&amp;#39;s absolutely right but until we
mature, discover-ability can be a problem. We all have our resources
and I for one am frequently surprised when talking to a friend and
discovering that they don&amp;#39;t know about a site or a mailing list that
I&amp;#39;ve known about for years. Likewise, I&amp;#39;m appreciative when others
share resources with me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are some collections of information, for instance, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alfredtwo&#34;&gt;Alfred
Thompson&lt;/a&gt; has a list of CS Education bloggers but it&amp;#39;s not so easy to
discover and it certainly shouldn&amp;#39;t fall on Alfred to maintain such
a list making sure the links are all active and always being
responsible for adding new ones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Recently I&amp;#39;ve noticed a proliferation of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;awesome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
lists. These are community curated lists hosted up on GitHub for a
variety of projects. I find myself using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs&#34;&gt;awesome-emacs&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python&#34;&gt;awesome-python&lt;/a&gt; more and more and there are tons of other such lists.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I thought we, as a community could benefit from such a list.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started one off. It&amp;#39;s over at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education&#34;&gt;https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with instructions on
contributing at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education/blob/master/contributing.org&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education/blob/master/contributing.org&#34;&gt;https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education/blob/master/contributing.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I seeded it with a few items but I&amp;#39;d love everyone to get involved. I
also started it with a few categories and a specific format but I&amp;#39;d
love to see that evolve into something most useful for the community
as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you agree that this could be something useful, please contribute to
it and help spread the word.
&lt;/p&gt;
