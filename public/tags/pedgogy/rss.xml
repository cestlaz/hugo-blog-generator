      <title>Code Review Revisited or research - the teacher version</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Last semester I wrote about how I was introducing my students to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/code-review/&#34;&gt;code
review&lt;/a&gt;. I thought it worked pretty well and was anxious to try it
again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Well, I did the lesson(s) again this past week and it looks like it&amp;#39;s
a keeper. The setup was pretty much the same with some hiccups due to
using a new platform. Last semester I used plain GitHub public
repos. This time, I&amp;#39;ve been using GitHub classroom which I like very
much but I forgot that I made this assignment use private repos which
turned out to be a hassle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you didn&amp;#39;t read the previous post the short version was:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
group the kids in two&amp;#39;s
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Each does a written (no talking) code review on the others previous
lab. Very little guidance was given as to what the review should
look like.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We then did two parings where one person talked through a live code
review with the other.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, we did one more written session. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This left person with three reviews. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This took the whole class since we had to finish some other material
before starting the reviews.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
During the next class we discussed the review, what was important,
what wasn&amp;#39;t etc. We also talked about coding standards and things like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines&#34;&gt;The C++ Core Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; and Google&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html&#34;&gt;C++ Style Guide&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a follow up assignment, they&amp;#39;re going to add a feature to another
student&amp;#39;s solution to the lab they reviewed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It seems that the class was effective when I taught it last
semester. I&amp;#39;ve come to that conclusion because I&amp;#39;m teaching that group
again in their Data Structures class and they seem to do better with
Pair Programming (which I related to a live, real-time code review)
and it does seem that they&amp;#39;re paying at least a bit more attention to
the issues we highlighted in the code review lesson. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I won&amp;#39;t get the same chance to follow up with this group but I can at
least see in the next few weeks if it had any positive affect. One of
the things I&amp;#39;m curious about has to do with the student&amp;#39;s backgrounds.
Last semester&amp;#39;s students all had a year of APCS-A under their belts
before coming to Hunter. This semester&amp;#39;s students had a range from
APCS-P to a summer or after school program to nothing and their last
semester class with me was in my opinion a much lighter programming
class than a year of APCS-A. I&amp;#39;m wondering if the current crop, having
written fewer large programs will have a different appreciation for
the topics we discussed during the code reviews. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of this got me to thinking about some of the things I saw both at
SIGCSE and on some of the posts that followed. Specifically about
teacher vs researchers and also, although not mentioned, K12 teachers,
teachers at the college level and researchers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was thinking about the fact that this is one of the ways I work to
improve at my craft. I try something, evaluate and reflect on the
results, then repeat, tweak etc. Not everything I try is a winner but
overall I think I&amp;#39;ve made a pretty steady progression as a
teacher. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was also thinking that had I done this while in High School I would
have taught the lessons two to five times to similar but different
groups of students within a short period of days. I would also have
been able to iterate, possibly with variations, each semester. It
might not be instant but that&amp;#39;s a lot of potential feedback. At
college, I&amp;#39;m only teaching one section of each class and I&amp;#39;m guessing
that most full time faculty members might only teach two of a
particular class (although I could be very wrong - I just based this
on looking up a few schedules). I also don&amp;#39;t see my kids every
day. This makes for a slower, less effective feedback loop. On the
other hand, I&amp;#39;m not running pillar to post every day so can actually
take the time to evaluate what&amp;#39;s been happening in each class in
arguably a more meaningful way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of this is to say that most teachers I know trust other teacher&amp;#39;s
experiences rather than &amp;#34;the research&amp;#34; and that was also what was born
out in this University of Colorado &lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3287420&#34;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;. While there are plenty of
bad teachers who know that &amp;#34;it&amp;#39;s always been done this way and it&amp;#39;s
worked well enough&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;ll always consider my most trusted education
resource to be a thoughtful, reflective, experienced teacher who
actively works on improving at their craft.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is not to say that there isn&amp;#39;t merit in research. I saw
presentations at SIGCSE and on the one had said to myself &amp;#34;ok, so he
discovered something that any moderately experienced K12 teacher
already knows&amp;#34; and at the same time thinking &amp;#34;but it&amp;#39;s great that
they&amp;#39;re now formalizing and documenting it.&amp;#34; There are also things
that can be researched that a single classroom teacher just can&amp;#39;t
approach and finally, to paraphrase a line from Mark Guzdial&amp;#39;s talk
where he specifically addressed other CS Ed researchers - we can build
things and they need things built - a teacher / researcher partnership
can open a lot of yet unexplored doors for educators.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s all a reminder that we&amp;#39;re all playing different
roles. Researchers aren&amp;#39;t teachers, college teachers aren&amp;#39;t K12
teachers, K12 teachers subdivide further and of course the same holds
for the reverse direction. Sure there are similarities in our goals
and our roles but there are some important differences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With that in mind, I&amp;#39;ll leave this with a quote form one of the all
time great screwball comedies:

      <title>An experiment with code review</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/code-review/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes professional practices don&amp;#39;t work well in the classroom and
sometimes they do. One professional practice that does work well is
code review - reading and reflecting on other peoples code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve had my students do code reviews in the past but this time I did
things differently. Here&amp;#39;s what I did and here&amp;#39;s how it went
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Two weeks ago my students completed a lab. The lab involved reading
in a poorly indented C++ program and spit out a properly indented
one. This was the platform for the reviews.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First we paired everyone off. They forked each others labs and then
did a code review on each others assignment. Each student would read
their partner&amp;#39;s code, decide what to focus on - the whole thing, a
single function or something in between, and write up a code
review. They couldn&amp;#39;t talk during this process. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was intentionally a little vague in the details of the assignment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Afterwards, each student got a new partner and we did the review again
but this time one student would review the other&amp;#39;s code and they would
talk through the process while they took notes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next, we changed pairs a third time and this time the student that did
the talking review last time got their code reviewed in the same way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, we repeated the whole thing again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This left each student with four code reviews. Two done in silence and
two that were interactive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This took the entire hour fifteen of class so we didn&amp;#39;t get to discuss
the review until the following week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first thing I asked when we debriefed was which review was more
valuable? The written or the interactive one. They universally liked the
latter. This led to a spin-off discussion on pair programming. I love
pair programming as a pedagogical tool but students don&amp;#39;t always buy
all in. Some don&amp;#39;t communicate as much as the should and don&amp;#39;t get as
much value out of the process as they could. On the other hand, they
all seemed to see the value in the interactive code review but if you
think about it, pair programming is really a real time interactive
code review. I&amp;#39;m hoping this process helps with pair programming buy
in. I think it will.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next we talked about takeaways from all their reviews. There were good
comments on, well, commenting, also on function length. This led to
talk about self commenting code, good variable and function names,
style guides, function header comments and all sorts
of good coding stuff.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All this was great but I think more than the recap, the reviews
themselves might have had the greatest impact.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One student commented that he found the code he reviewed much easier
to read and understand that his own code because it did indeed use
better function and variable names and was better laid out and
commented. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another student noted that for a couple of programs he reviewed he had
a hard time understanding what the programmer was doing. During the
interactive review it was apparent that the author also no longer
understood their own code. I think that, at least for these students,
it really drove home the idea of writing good code. We talked about
how the real world would be different. In class they work on a project
in a concentrated short period of time. In the real world, they&amp;#39;ll be
working on multiple projects or at least multiple segments of projects
on and off over a long period of time. Remembering your own code is
super critical.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Overall, I&amp;#39;m very happy with the way these lessons played out. I
already thought that the actual code reviews had value but doing it
this way led to more student discovery some great discussions and
reflections. I think it was a big win.
&lt;/p&gt;
