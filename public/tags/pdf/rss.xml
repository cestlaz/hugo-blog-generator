One of my titles at Hunter College is Director of the Daedalus CS
Honors program. It&amp;#39;s something like a Hunter specific, CS specific
version of the CUNY Macaulay Honors program.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hunter gives all its students the ability to get a great computer
science education at a fraction of the cost of a private institution
and if you&amp;#39;re a Daedalus scholar you also get a scholarship, a laptop,
special classes (with me :-) ), activities and more. Just the other
day we visited  &lt;a href=&#34;http://samsungnext.com/&#34;&gt;Samsung Next&lt;/a&gt; accelerator and earlier in the year we
made our annual visit to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.catskillsconf.com/&#34;&gt;Catskills Conf&lt;/a&gt;, arguably my favorite event of
the year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When deciding on which students to recommend for acceptance, I try to
glean as much information as I can about each applicant. When I feel
there&amp;#39;s not enough information, I&amp;#39;ve been known to reach out to
recommenders and other sources for more. But first I go through the
applications. For each student, I&amp;#39;m provided with a pdf file with a
bunch of data and also an entry in an internal Hunter online form with
even more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the first cohort, this wasn&amp;#39;t a big deal. I hadn&amp;#39;t even started at
Hunter when the applications closed so there was no
outreach. Everything was after the fact so there were very few
students to evaluate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Last year, I was able to do some outreach and we had around 60 or so
applications for a little over 20 spots.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This year, there are well over 100 applicants (and we&amp;#39;re looking to
grow the program by a large number of students). All of a sudden, it
wasn&amp;#39;t so easy to navigate all the pdf files.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Emacs to the rescue. Using a combination of org-mod,  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools&#34;&gt;pdf-tools&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://melpa.org/#/org-pdfview&#34;&gt;org-pdfview&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#39;ve come up with a workflow that I very much like.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Take a look and let me know what you think:
