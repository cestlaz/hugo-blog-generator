      <title>Judging a  High School Hackathon - StuyHacks VIII</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Today I got to be a judge at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stuyhacks.com/&#34;&gt;StuyHacks VIII&lt;/a&gt;. This isn&amp;#39;t the first time
I&amp;#39;ve been a judge there, I&amp;#39;ve been doing it for a few years now. I&amp;#39;ve
also been lucky enought to have been asked to judge a handful of other
local hackathons over the years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
StuyHacks is a high school hackathon organized and run by students at
Stuyvesant High School. Since it&amp;#39;s run by students, the cast of
organizers regularly changes. They run two events a year. One is a
morning to night hackathon hosted at the school and the other is an
overnight hackathon hosted externally. Recently &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gakko.org/&#34;&gt;Gakko&lt;/a&gt; has been
gracious enough to host.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While the largest group of participants are from Stuyvesant, the event
draws from all over NYC, Long Island and New Jersey. Most of the
participants are high schoolers but there are always enough younger
students to make it a comfortable event for middle schoolers as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As usual, the participants did some great work. The winning project
was a medical diagnosis application and second place was a contraption
to sort garbage into recyclables and non recyclables. Both reminded me
of academic research that a friend of mine was doing around a decade
ago. It struck me that with current tools, libraries, and APIs,
something that was a really hard problem 10 years ago can at least be
explored by young programmers in a short period of time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There were also some very interesting games and a variety of neat
projects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also started to think about the difficulty in judging projects. Over
the years I&amp;#39;ve worked with a large cadre of judges. All were involved
in tech but many weren&amp;#39;t programmers and many hadn&amp;#39;t had any
familiarity with the technologies used at a typical High School or
College Hackathon. There were a lot of very cool projects but while a
great idea well implemented does indeed make a great project it
doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily make one that shows great programming or software
architecture skills. I remember a few hackathons ago where a judge was
incredibly impressed with the implementation of a project where it was
merely glue and a little tweaking of example code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A few years ago when I saw a project that used a machine learning or
AI technique it meant the group coded it. The kids implemented a
classifier from scratch, coded up a regression, a clustering
algorithm, or whatever. Now, they don&amp;#39;t have to know anything about ML
or AI - merely how to use the IBM or Google APIs. It doesn&amp;#39;t mean they
don&amp;#39;t know these things but rather that they don&amp;#39;t have to. It also
means that since man students can now leverage other peoples tools
quickly and easily they&amp;#39;ll get much better results. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today I saw a project that was pretty neat - it did a bunch of real
time image processing. It made extensive use of libraries and it was
indeed a very nice project. I saw a simpler similar project a few
years ago where those libraries weren&amp;#39;t available so the group had to
code simpler versions of the functionality by hand. It was also a cool
project but since it was all home grown it did less and was much less
polished. Which one was better? Who&amp;#39;s to say. Of course this makes
things hard when comparing projects - some kids know more about tools
and libraries than others. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
None of this is to either add or take away from what hackathon
participatns can and do accomplish. I loved the projects from
hackathons past and I loved what I saw today. It&amp;#39;s just interesting to
see how things are evolving. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event, if you have a chance to go to a local High School
hackathon either as a judge, a mentor, or just as someone to look at
some youngsters projects and give some words of encouragement I highly
recommend doing so.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
StuyHacks VIII was a great event and I hope the organizers give me the
opportunity to continue to be part of it in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thoughts On A Hackathon</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/thoughts-on-a-hackathon/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday I was one of the judges at &lt;a href=&#34;http://stuyhacks.com/&#34;&gt;StuyHacks&lt;/a&gt;. A one day hackathon at
Stuyvesant run by and organized by the students. I don&amp;#39;t have attendee
stats but there were kids from all over the city and at least one team
from New Jersey. The youngest student that I met was in sixth grade
and the oldest were high school seniors. The judging was at the end
but I decided to stop by earlier to see how the hackers were doing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There was an incredible variety of projects using a wide array of
tools. There were projects built with:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Java
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Processing
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
C#
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Scratch
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A-Frame
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Python / Flask
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
HTML/CSS/JS
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and more
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A personal highlight for me was running into Sophie - the daughter of
two of my students from #Stuy95. Well, both a highlight and a reminder
that I&amp;#39;m getting old.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The StuyHacks team did a terrific job running things and at the end I
told them I&amp;#39;d love to help with future events.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I did notice a couple of things at the hackathon that echo things I&amp;#39;ve
learned as a teacher over the years and I thought they were worth
sharing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first was the a number of the beginner groups needed more
direction. This didn&amp;#39;t seem to be related to grade level or age as
much as CS experience. This isn&amp;#39;t a hackathon only issue. It exists in
all learning environments. If as teachers we&amp;#39;re too prescriptive
students end up with a single formula to follow. Sure, that&amp;#39;ll get
them through a standardized exam like APCS-A but too much of it can
hinder them in becoming creative problem solvers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, not enough structure will leave many kids staring
at a blank page. I remember I gave a quiz years ago. It had one
problem: &amp;#34;You have 20 minutes to prove to me that you learned
something about the past unit on Cellular Autmata&amp;#34; or something like
that. Some kids absolutely loved it but many hated it. Stuy kids are
trained test takers. They&amp;#39;re prepared for structure. This threw many
for a loop.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I noticed this issue with some of the hackers at StuyHacks. Some
beginners really had a hard time figuring out what they could do and
what they should do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A hackathon isn&amp;#39;t a classroom so I think the problem is pretty easily
remedied. Groups that were able to latch on to a good mentor seemed to
get the guidance they needed. A beginners hackathon should make sure
they have not only plenty of mentors but they should make sure that
the mentors are prepped with a number of project ideas in a number of
the standard beginner platforms. A hackathon could also provide an
assortment of ideas in a list.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The second thing I noticed was at the end of the day as I was
judging. It started with one particular group. They were pretty
apologetic about their project. Basically because it wasn&amp;#39;t
finished. Personally, I thought what they accomplished in essentially
7 hours was pretty impressive. What became clear as we talked is that
this group was deathly afraid of failure. Their deepest fear at that
moment was that I was going to give them high marks and they might
have to show off their incomplete (yet rather impressive) project to a
room full of strangers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This fear of failure was prevalent in groups that ultimately didn&amp;#39;t
submit their projects for judging and it seemed to be common among
students from high performing, high expectation schools where
frequently one associates a test score or grade with ones value. I&amp;#39;m
not happy to say that Stuy has always had this problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This isn&amp;#39;t really a problem that a hackathon can or should be able to
address. It&amp;#39;s just something I noticed. It&amp;#39;s a problem for schools and
also for a society that&amp;#39;s test obsessed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I hope nobody reads too much into these observations. The day was a
tremendous success. A whole bunch of kids had a great day working
together to build cool things with technology. Congratulations to the
StuyHacks team. They did a terrific job putting it all together. If
you&amp;#39;re a middle or high school student or know one, keep an eye on the
StuyHacks &lt;a href=&#34;http://stuyhacks.com/&#34;&gt;web page&lt;/a&gt; and make sure to attend their next event.
&lt;/p&gt;
