Two of the challenges faced by young computer science students are
finding the time to build independent projects for their portfolios
and getting feedback from and networking with tech professionals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Enter Hunter Codefest 2020
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
.flip {
    -webkit-transform: rotate(180deg);
    -moz-transform: rotate(180deg);
    -o-transform: rotate(180deg);
    -ms-transform: rotate(180deg);
    transform: rotate(180deg);
}
&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;z_image_left flip&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/codefest2020/codefest.jpg&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;z_image_left flip&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/codefest2020/google.jpg&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&amp;lt;br clear=&amp;#34;all&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hunter, like most colleges has a Fall semester that runs from late
August through the end of Decemeber and a Spring semester that starts
at the end of January and runs through late may. There&amp;#39;s generally
around a month between the two. Sometimes a student can take one of
the few courses offered during this &amp;#34;Winter semester&amp;#34; but more often
than not the time is wasted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At Hunter, students can do a number of things during this break. Some get short term
mini internships, others take part in our tech bootcamps. Now, they
can all participate in Codefest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We launched in late December at the end of finals. Students are given
a theme and form groups. They then have a month to build a
project. It&amp;#39;s a great opportunity to learn how to work on a team and
explore tools that you wouldn&amp;#39;t normally use in a regular CS class.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Friday was the payoff. We all gathered at GoogleNYC for a big
celebration. Each group was set up at a table with professional
Software Engineers. Mostly Googlers but wa also invited some outside
guests. They&amp;#39;d then spend time with discussing the project. After a
while, the Googlers would rotate to another project.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rinse and repeat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Afterwards we had some demos and then a big networking session where
our Hunter CS students got to spend more time getting to know and
getting advice from a host of Googlers and other software engineers
while enjoying refreshments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not everyone could make it due to class but we had a pretty strong
turnout.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our student organizers did most of the heavy lifting and made the
whole event work from start to finish. Here are Leo, Angela, Shariar,
and Tracey. Our two other organizers, Miguel and Kun couldn&amp;#39;t make it
as Miguel was travelling and Kun had an interview for an internship.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Special thanks to Brendan and hist team of Googlers who helped make
this happen. I also want to say thanks to the dozen or so of my former
students currently at Google who stopped by to help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Everyone was super impressed with what the students produced. It was
a great event and it&amp;#39;ll be even better next year.
&lt;/p&gt;
