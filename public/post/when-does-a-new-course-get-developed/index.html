Following up on my last post I thought I&#39;d talk a bit more about
course development. According to most powers that be it&#39;s all done
ahead of time. Organizations and companies with curricula to sell
package it all up ahead of time lesson by lesson unit by unit. When
I create a new course at Hunter, they demand a sample syllabus during
the approval process with a week by week outline, assignments reading
and more. When I created CAPE for Google back in 2010 even though the
programs man advocate knew the real deal he and I spoke many times
about needing something on paper to satisfy the higher ups. 
</p>
<p>
To me most of this is nonsense. When I create a new course I have an
idea and a direction but little else. Of course there&#39;s much work to
be done between idea and implementation but for me  a detailed
curriculum that early is mostly a waste of time. Why? Because it all
changes once you get in the classroom.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll do the bare minimum to get by the gatkeepers. If they want a week
to week, I give them a week to week but I won&#39;t stress over it. I
then get to work on what I feel I need prior to running a course. A
framework and the first few lessons in detail.
</p>
<p>
Developing the framework means:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
understanding enough of the content to teach the course. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
deciding on how you will teach or run the course
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
developing rough outlines for units, possible assignments etc.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
finding and understanding resources like possible texts and tools
and also things like data sources mentioned in my previous post.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And of course there&#39;s more. I&#39;ll also work out the first unit in day
by day detail. 
</p>
<p>
Another important aspect is that this framework design is where you
put in your safety nets. What&#39;s the backup plan if unit 2 takes too
long or students just aren&#39;t getting unit 3. Another important aspect
is to prepare too much material. In my experience it usually takes
longer to teach something than you originally plan but I still think
it&#39;s better to plan too much rather than too little.
</p>
<p>
Why do I only plan out the first unit in details? Because i know
things will change once the rubber hits the road. Even if it doesn&#39;t
change, developing specific lessons without regard to your current
students seems rather odd. It reminds me of how <a href="http://www.bill-irwin.com/">Bill Irwin</a> learned his
role in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Men_Out">Eight Men Out</a>. Irwin&#39;s amazing but apparently never played
baseball. He played Eddie Collins, the White Sox second
baseman. Having not played himself, his action scenes were
choreographed like a dance. The director would yell action and he&#39;d do
his dance. If the ball happened to go where it was supposed to you
ended up with a bang bang play. If not, cut, retake. It worked for the
movie but it&#39;s not a great idea for a teacher. How can you plan day 5
of a class when the first four days and all the richness of the live
classes and time between hasn&#39;t occurred. 
</p>
<p>
Of course this means a lot of work under the gun but no one ever said
that developing a new course was easy. It&#39;s reassuring that I&#39;m not
the only one who does the real class development in real time:
</p>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Building the course as the semester goes, but the barebones syllabus is here. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/guzdial?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@guzdial</a>, we are using GP as the main language. Reading things like Pattern on the Stone, chapters from Constructionism book by Harel &amp; Papert.  <a href="https://t.co/CNgEQfcO1Z">https://t.co/CNgEQfcO1Z</a>.</p>&mdash; Aman Yadav (@yadavaman) <a href="https://twitter.com/yadavaman/status/1082280379153829888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2019</a></blockquote>

<p>
Finally having survived the first run through it&#39;s time to <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?PlanToThrowOneAway">throw it
away</a>. Not really but it&#39;s time to take lessons learned and work them
into the class. From there, it&#39;s incremental improvements.
</p>
<p>
So there you have it, a summary of my approach to course creation.
