Let&#39;s talk about something other than distance learning and COVID-19.
</p>
<p>
You know you&#39;ve been doing something a long time when you&#39;ve got
legends.
</p>
<p>
Over on my alumni mailing list JonAlf shared a web site showing off
what his current students were doing in their computer graphics
class. Somewhere in the thread, Con replied:
</p>
<p>
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Someone should put up a video of the fabulous and fantastically famous
hand animation called FINGER.MDL. It dates from a little before my
time, but stories elevated it to legendary status.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</p>
<p>
Indeed it had reached legendary status. Other projects over the years
including Larry&#39;s anatomically correct robot had also risen to
infamy. 
</p>
<p>
A little later in the thread the project&#39;s author Josh chimed in and
shared his original source code. He still had it from May 1995. I&#39;m
not entirely surprised - I had a copy of the code as well. The trouble
is it was written in Turbo-C on a DOS machine. Good luck compiling it
on a modern system. Fortunately, Josh was able to build and run the
project using an emulator. Check out the  marginally NSFW video at the
end of the post.
</p>
<p>
So, what&#39;s the legend? Well, in addition to being a pretty terrific
project - particularly when you remember the horsepower it was running
on and that it was written by a student who was concurrently finishing
APCS, there&#39;s a story.
</p>
<p>
It starts in one of my APCS classes. Students were working on final
projects. Tom was working on Tetris - an impressive project for APCS
done in Turbo Pascal. Tom wanted to add music to the project and had a
clever way of doing it. Back then you could get basic sounds by
turning on and off the speaker at certain frequencies. Tom had two
arrays, one with frequencies and one with durations.
</p>
<p>
Something like: 
</p>
<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">notes<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>[<span style="color:#ae81ff">440</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">523</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">440</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">659</span>,<span style="color:#f92672">...</span>]
durations<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>[<span style="color:#ae81ff">20</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">50</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">15</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">30</span>,<span style="color:#f92672">...</span>]</code></pre></div>
</p>
<p>
Then for the game loop
</p>
<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#75715e">#+begin_src python</span>

  current_note<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>
  note <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> notes[current_note]
  duration <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> durations[current_note]
  play(note) <span style="color:#75715e"># starts the note playing until you change or stop it</span>
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">while</span> game_not_over:
      duration <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> duration <span style="color:#f92672">-</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>
      <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> duration <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:
          current_note <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> (current_note<span style="color:#f92672">+</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>)<span style="color:#f92672">%</span>length(notes)
          note <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> notes[current_note]
          duration <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> durations[current_note]
          play(note) <span style="color:#75715e"># starts the note playing until you change or stop it</span>
      <span style="color:#75715e"># the rest of the game loop</span>
  stop_playing() <span style="color:#75715e"># stop the speaker</span>

    

<span style="color:#75715e">#+end_src</span></code></pre></div>
</p>
<p>
Still, he had to figure out all the frequencies and durations for
&#34;Korobeiniki,&#34; the tetris song. The class was more than happy to help.
</p>
<p>
Everyone&#39;s working to help figure this out for Tom. It&#39;s all pretty
cool when in walks Jinx Perullo - Stuy&#39;s new principal along with the
President of the New York City Board of Education. The President&#39;s jaw
drops as she hears a cacophony of Tetris music and screen after screen
of Tetris being played!!!!! 
</p>
<p>
Jinx makes an abrupt about face and drags the dignitary out of the
room. 
</p>
<p>
Fast forward a week or so. We&#39;re in the graphics class at the end of
the day - it was held during an non-existent after school period so
that the students could attend. Josh&#39;s working on his graphics program
at a computer by the door.
</p>
<p>
Jinx walked in again. This time with the school&#39;s chancelor to be
greeted by:
</p>
<p>
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34;
src=&#34;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ca_8q3ct6J4">https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ca_8q3ct6J4</a>&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;
allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</p>
<p>
Once again, a quick about face.
</p>
<p>
For some reason Jinx never brought important people to my classes
again.
</p>
<p>
Those were indeed the good old days.
