I spent a couple of days last week hunkered down working designing a
CS Ethics course and of course it got me thinking about designing
courses in general. 
</p>
<p>
One of the topics I&#39;ve ranted on is my disdain for canned
curricula. I&#39;ve never been a fan. This isn&#39;t to say I don&#39;t want to
leverage other people&#39;s work. I&#39;ll take sample curricula, lessons, and
all the resources I can get my hands on but I&#39;d never just deliver
them as is. Even back when I started as a math teacher and I had the
NYCDOE lesson plan books to use as samples, I&#39;d use those lessons as
sources to develop my own.
</p>
<p>
I was reminded why I do this as I was developing my ethics course. I
want the course to have a significant amount of programming and for
some of the projects US census data and the NYC data mine look to be
good sources of data. I was led to these sources from some project
ideas I found online but those projects provided the data pre
processed. Had I been using these sources as a canned curriculum
things would be fine until something changed. Either the resource went
away or the direction of the class required something different. In
either event, had I been happy to merely use someone elses canned
materials I wouldn&#39;t be prepared.
</p>
<p>
It turns out that you&#39;ve got to do some digging before you can
effectively use a resource like the US census data. Maybe you can use
the <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml%5D">American Fact Finder</a>. With it you can download a refined data set
as a CSV but you&#39;ll still have to figure out how to use the tool and
which data sets you need. Another approach is to <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/data-via-ftp.html">download the data via
FTP</a> but then you have to figure out how the files are arranged. 
</p>
<p>
All of this is to say that you can&#39;t just go to census.gov and
trivially get what you need and you certainly can&#39;t just send students
there and say &#34;good luck.&#34; I spent more hours that I&#39;d care to admit
last week figuring out the ins and outs of a variety of data sources
and I&#39;ve got many more hours ahead. It&#39;s taking a lot of time but at
the end of the day, I&#39;ll own the knowledge. 
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day the first time you offer a course most of your
pre planning is going to go out the window. You need a framework, a
direction, and a start but first time through you don&#39;t know how or
where things will really go. If you&#39;re using someone else material,
good luck when things take an unexpected turn. If you own the course,
you&#39;ll be prepared.
