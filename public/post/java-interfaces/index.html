Two of the hardest topics to make meaningful to students in APCS-A are
inheritance and interfaces. It&#39;s not that they&#39;re super difficult
topics but rather that they&#39;re not often needed, useful, or superior
to not using them on beginner assignments. More often than not the
motivation is a bit forced as are the assignments. 
</p>
<p>
Inheritance is its own can of worms and to be honest, something I&#39;ve
not found to be all that useful or necessary. The class abstraction
made sense to me for a number of projects but deep inheritance just
hasn&#39;t come up much. 
</p>
<p>
In any event, today I thought I&#39;d talk about interfaces.
</p>
<p>
When Java was first built a decision was made not to allow multiple
inheritance - the idea that a class can be derived from multiple
parents. Multiple inheritance is powerful but it can also be
complicated and confusing. By not including multiple inheritance Java
ended up easier to work with than say C++ but there were times where
you needed features that multiple inheritance provide. Specifically
there are times when you need some functionality that operates across
multiple unrelated classes. Without any other features, you&#39;d have to
start <strong>all</strong> of your classes from a single based class and include that
functionality. Clearly not a good idea.
</p>
<p>
The first useful example is probably <code>Comparable</code>
</p>
<div class="src src-java">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
At first blush it might not seem all that useful. 
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s suppose you are doing something like finding the first String
(alphabetically) from an array:
</p>
<div class="src src-java">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
That&#39;s easy enough but what if you had another class, <code>Shape</code> where
you wanted to find the &#34;smallest&#34; based on area and a third class
<code>Person</code> where you want to find the smallest by age? Without
interfaces you would need three independent search routines or set up
a crazy inheritance hierarchy where <code>String</code>, <code>Person</code> and <code>Shape</code> all
come from the same parent. Instead, by having your two new classes
implement the <code>Comparable</code> interface all three can use the same
search:
</p>
<div class="src src-java">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
This is not entirely true. The above solution will give you compiler
warnings. You&#39;ll have to decide if it makes sense to jump through the
hoops necessary to get rid of the warnings or if it&#39;s sufficient to do
some vigorous had waving.
</p>
<p>
This is the benefit of interfaces. You can create functionality that
works across classes. In addition to writing things like our
 <code>findSmallest</code> above, if our classes implement <code>Comparable</code> we can sort
collections of our classes using the built in sort methods.
</p>
<p>
This is a benefit that our students can probably appreciate.
</p>
<p>
Anther place interfaces come up and make sense are with GUI
programming. It&#39;s pretty easy to show the utility of using interfaces
with the assorted listeners. That said, Java GUI programming is
something of a bear so maybe that&#39;s not the way to go.
</p>
<p>
Where else can you explore interfaces in APCS-A? Any program where you
have different entities that change in different ways over time. This
might be a simulation where time passes via a control loop or maybe a
game where time passes a turn at a time.
</p>
<p>
For example, you might have a simulation with various resources that
implement an interface with an <code>update</code> routine:
</p>
<div class="src src-java">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Maybe a food resource updates by raising or lowering the amount of
food it provides or perhaps an animal resource updates its location. You could
have an array of objects that implement this interface and just call
update on each one.
</p>
<p>
You could do the same with a game. Maybe the human player&#39;s <code>update</code> 
prompts for keyboard input while non player characters just calculate
their next state.
</p>
<p>
Interfaces are not the easiest thing to teach. The mechanics are
straightforward but the motivation is frequently forced for
beginners. I was never 100% happy with how I did it and now that I&#39;m
in a C++ shop it doesn&#39;t come up but I hope this is helpful to some of
you out there.
