Today I got to be a judge at <a href="https://www.stuyhacks.com/">StuyHacks VIII</a>. This isn&#39;t the first time
I&#39;ve been a judge there, I&#39;ve been doing it for a few years now. I&#39;ve
also been lucky enought to have been asked to judge a handful of other
local hackathons over the years.
</p>
<p>
StuyHacks is a high school hackathon organized and run by students at
Stuyvesant High School. Since it&#39;s run by students, the cast of
organizers regularly changes. They run two events a year. One is a
morning to night hackathon hosted at the school and the other is an
overnight hackathon hosted externally. Recently <a href="https://www.gakko.org/">Gakko</a> has been
gracious enough to host.
</p>
<p>
While the largest group of participants are from Stuyvesant, the event
draws from all over NYC, Long Island and New Jersey. Most of the
participants are high schoolers but there are always enough younger
students to make it a comfortable event for middle schoolers as well.
</p>
<p>
As usual, the participants did some great work. The winning project
was a medical diagnosis application and second place was a contraption
to sort garbage into recyclables and non recyclables. Both reminded me
of academic research that a friend of mine was doing around a decade
ago. It struck me that with current tools, libraries, and APIs,
something that was a really hard problem 10 years ago can at least be
explored by young programmers in a short period of time.
</p>
<p>
There were also some very interesting games and a variety of neat
projects.
</p>
<p>
I also started to think about the difficulty in judging projects. Over
the years I&#39;ve worked with a large cadre of judges. All were involved
in tech but many weren&#39;t programmers and many hadn&#39;t had any
familiarity with the technologies used at a typical High School or
College Hackathon. There were a lot of very cool projects but while a
great idea well implemented does indeed make a great project it
doesn&#39;t necessarily make one that shows great programming or software
architecture skills. I remember a few hackathons ago where a judge was
incredibly impressed with the implementation of a project where it was
merely glue and a little tweaking of example code.
</p>
<p>
A few years ago when I saw a project that used a machine learning or
AI technique it meant the group coded it. The kids implemented a
classifier from scratch, coded up a regression, a clustering
algorithm, or whatever. Now, they don&#39;t have to know anything about ML
or AI - merely how to use the IBM or Google APIs. It doesn&#39;t mean they
don&#39;t know these things but rather that they don&#39;t have to. It also
means that since man students can now leverage other peoples tools
quickly and easily they&#39;ll get much better results. 
</p>
<p>
Today I saw a project that was pretty neat - it did a bunch of real
time image processing. It made extensive use of libraries and it was
indeed a very nice project. I saw a simpler similar project a few
years ago where those libraries weren&#39;t available so the group had to
code simpler versions of the functionality by hand. It was also a cool
project but since it was all home grown it did less and was much less
polished. Which one was better? Who&#39;s to say. Of course this makes
things hard when comparing projects - some kids know more about tools
and libraries than others. 
</p>
<p>
None of this is to either add or take away from what hackathon
participatns can and do accomplish. I loved the projects from
hackathons past and I loved what I saw today. It&#39;s just interesting to
see how things are evolving. 
</p>
<p>
In any event, if you have a chance to go to a local High School
hackathon either as a judge, a mentor, or just as someone to look at
some youngsters projects and give some words of encouragement I highly
recommend doing so.
</p>
<p>
StuyHacks VIII was a great event and I hope the organizers give me the
opportunity to continue to be part of it in the future.
