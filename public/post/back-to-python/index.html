With summer right around the corner I&#39;m hoping to spend at least a
little time on some personal coding projects. There are a few work
related tools I&#39;d love to develop and just some random areas of CS I&#39;d
like to explore. If I finish them, the work projects will be web
based.
</p>
<p>
I was thinking about using this as an opportunity to do a deeper dive
into Clojure having used it for some experiments and competitions like
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> but at the end of the day I decided not
to. It&#39;s not that Clojure wouldn&#39;t be a good language for web apps. It
looks like it would be great. Rather, I&#39;m finding the ecosystem and
build systems in particular to be more trouble than they&#39;re worth for
a side project - particularly when I want to accomplish more than
becoming comfortable with the Clojure ecosystem. 
</p>
<p>
Things were so much simpler in the old days. Way back when I was a
software engineer at Goldman Sachs I worked on a couple of large,
complex systems. All I had were a bunch of C files in a bunch of
directories and a Makefile to build everything. Simple and
straightforward. 
</p>
<p>
If I&#39;m working in C or C++ I can still do the same. 
</p>
<p>
In Java I was always able to do the same since Make seemed to be
accepted in the community. Now there seems to be many more
options - Ant, Maven, and Gradle to name just three.
</p>
<p>
Python was even easier - just set up your directory structure
and <code>__init__.py</code> files and your good to go and by using a virtual
environment, which is pretty easy, you can keep the entire development
environment clean.
</p>
<p>
Nowadays things are much more complex. Sure, I can create a simple
Clojure program and run it but anything bigger and you need a build
system. For a long time the tool was <a href="https://leiningen.org/">Leiningen</a>. You define a project
file using it&#39;s particular syntax and it can download dependencies,
manage builds etc.. It actually doesn&#39;t look so bad if you&#39;re living
in Clojure all the time but for a hobbyist like me I found myself
looking for other peoples templates and hoping for the best. Whenever
I needed my project to do things outside the norm I was pretty much
out of luck. 
</p>
<p>
Then came <a href="https://boot-clj.com/">Boot</a> as an alternative. Where Leiningen used a descriptive
configuration file, Boot used a configuration file that was basically
Clojure code. It was different but to me, it had the same problems -
documentation was lacking and too much magic going on behind the
scenes. Finally, Clojure started to come with <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli">build system</a>. I want to
like it but the documentation is even sparser and with three competing
build systems with varying levels of use and documentation it&#39;s less
than ideal for a guy like me.
</p>
<p>
Things get messier when you add in Clojurescript - Clojurescript
basically compiles Clojure code to Javascript. It has a great
development environment and handles state really nicely but for a
novice like me getting any of the build systems set up for Clojure and
Clojurescript in a way that makes sense is more than I want to
deal with right now.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t mean to be unfair to Clojure and its ecosystem. I still really
like the language and if I lived in it I&#39;m sure I&#39;d figure it all out
and be happy with it. It&#39;s also no worse and arguably better than
ecosystems for other languages. 
</p>
<p>
Javascript, for example makes you chose between gulp, grunt, webpack,
browserfity, parcel and maybe more. I think I finally got my head
aroudn webpack and parcel but it&#39;s really the wild west. Of course
those are just the Javsacript build systems you then have to make
choices like VueJS or React or something else. 
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s really no easy answer. 
</p>
<p>
Putting my teacher hat on for a second this is also an issue that our
students will have to deal with at some point. Are we helping them by
keeping them in web based language silos and simple IDEs or hurting
them? At what point do we transition them or do we leave it for them
to do on their own? I&#39;m not taking any position on this here and now
but it&#39;s something worth thinking about.
</p>
<p>
Back to my side projects. 
</p>
<p>
So, for the sake of getting things done I think I&#39;m going to fall back
to Python. I don&#39;t need to deal with any complex build systems, I can
write my web applications with Flask and it&#39;s also a nice platform for
the other things I&#39;d like to do.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll still probably play with Clojurescript for the web frontend ut if
that turns out to be proiblematics I&#39;ll just go back to VueJS.
</p>
<p>
Time to get to work.
