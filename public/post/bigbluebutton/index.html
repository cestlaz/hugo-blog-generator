As we scrambled to move online in March we used what we knew, what we
heard of and what we were allowed. This usually meant Zoom, Google
Meet, or Microsoft Teams.
</p>
<p>
I settled on Zoom. It worked and worked pretty well. There were a few
things I felt they could improve on but given that Zoom wasn&#39;t
designed as a teaching tool I&#39;ve been pretty happy with it.
</p>
<p>
Now that the emergency rush has passed we have time to see if there
are some better alternatives. First up is <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/">BigBlueButton</a>. I&#39;ll write up
another cool platform that&#39;s based on BigBlueButton in some future
post.
</p>
<p>
To start, BBB is open source. That&#39;s a big plus in my book. This means
we can self host it. Now, this can be a problem if installation and
maintenance is a pain but so far, it&#39;s been carefree.
</p>
<p>
Next, it has some nice features. It supports pretty much everything
that Zoom supports including: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
join passwords
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
waiting room
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Brady Bunch view 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
chat
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
reactions (raise hand etc.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
a shared whiteboard
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
screen sharing
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
breakout rooms
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
optional session recording. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
polling 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
and adds a few:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
a shared note space
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
shared whiteboard is really a presentation that you can upload
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A simple html5 client 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
BBB is also based on &#34;classrooms&#34; rather than meetings which as
a teacher seems cleaner and makes more sense.
</p>
<p>
If you want to try it out and I highly recommend you do, you can do so
on their web site.
</p>
<p>
Hosting is also pretty easy. I was originally turned off by the
strangely specific requirement of Ubuntu 16.04 but since Digital
Ocean - my preferred cloud provider lets me directly install that or
many other versions it wasn&#39;t a problem. You&#39;ll also need a box with
4GB memory and 4 cores. 
</p>
<p>
You can follow the install instructions on the BBB home page but it
was easier to follow <a href="https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install">these</a> instructions. Here&#39;s exactly what I did
(culled from the longer explanations on the bbb-install site I just
linked):
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Create the DO droplet or install an Ubuntu 16.04 mathine.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Log in and run <code>apt-get update</code>, <code>apt-get dist-upgrade</code> and
<code>apt-get upgrade</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Set up DNS for the box so you can get to it by name. To do this I
went to Google domains and added an entry for
bigbluebutton.huntercs.org.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I ran (all one line):
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">wget -qO- https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bbb-install.sh | bash -s -- -v xenial-22 -s bbbtest.huntercs.org -e zamansky@gmail.com -g</code></pre></div>&gt;}}
</p>
<p>
    This downloads and installs BBB and also uses <strong>certbot</strong> to set up
    ssl for secure connections.
</p>
<p>
After this was done, I created an admin account:
</p>
<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">cd greenlight/
docker exec greenlight-v2 bundle exec rake admin:create</code></pre></div>&gt;}}
</p>
<p>
At this point I was up and running so I went to the host and logged in
using the admin credentials that the above command gave me.
</p>
<p>
Next, log in, go to the user profile and change the admin account&#39;s
login and password. I also went to the org site settings and changed
registration so that people had to be invited - this only affects who
can create classrooms. Anyone can join as long as the teacher lets the
in.
</p>
<p>
As a last step you should remove the demos: <code>apt-get purge
bbb-demo</code>. The home page and install web site has more info on those.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re now ready to go. Make classrooms, invite your students and
you&#39;re off. 
</p>
<p>
Check it out. so far, I&#39;m liking it better than the non free non open
source alternatives offered by Zoom, Microsoft, and Google. 
</p>
<p>
Next, well look at another platform  that&#39;s based on BBB that adds
some very cool features for CS Teachers.
