I haven&#39;t been posting much over the past couple of weeks and that&#39;s
partly because we&#39;ve been under the weather.
</p>
<p>
Yep - Covid-19. 
</p>
<p>
First things first - we&#39;re all either recovered or well on the way. 
</p>
<p>
I thought I&#39;d write up our experience as it might be useful for
others who are going through similar. This disease is weird and seems
to affect people differently but three of us followed a similar path.
</p>
<p>
In terms of our current status, I&#39;ve been symptom free for a few
days. My sense of smell hasn&#39;t fully returned but it&#39;s starting to and
I&#39;ve been fever free for around two weeks. I&#39;ve been using a pulse
oximeter  and that&#39;s been reading normal. I still feel a bit off in
the evenings, haven&#39;t been sleeping well and get a bit of a headache
but I think that&#39;s mostly my inner hypochondriac and the headaches
from the poor sleep. Besides, the headaches feel different than when I
was having symptoms.
</p>
<p>
Batya and Devorah have been clear for a week longer than I&#39;ve been and
Natan hasn&#39;t yet shown any symptoms so hopefully he got it, built some
antibodies and is done.
</p>
<p>
Batya got it first then Devorah then me. The symptoms were largely the
same. As they say - flu like. Fever, chills, low energy, head or chest
congestion and loss of smell and taste. I never fully lost my taste
(but then nobody would accuse me of having good taste anyway) but it
did dull. Batya and I also got headaches. They were a little weird -
kindof between a regular headache and a migraine. We never had bad
coughs, just occasional ones.
</p>
<p>
The actual fever/chills part lasted for about 3 or 4 days each. Never
got as bad as a bad case of the flu and we never felt we had to rush
to the emergency room but we all essentially took some days off for
work. For me, it was mostly being lucky - my class days and important
meetings fell outside my sick zone and I was able to focus enough to
do the planning I had to albeit not optimally.
</p>
<p>
We never relapsed but recovery was slow. After the fever passed, we
all went through the &#34;I think I&#39;m feeling better&#34; stage where we still
had some congestion and were feeling &#34;off&#34; but we seemed to go in the
right direction. This seemed to last forever but at least for me, one
day a few days ago, I finally woke up feeling pretty good. 
</p>
<p>
By all counts we&#39;ve been lucky. Hopefully we&#39;ll have some level of
immunity - we&#39;re going to try to get antibody testing to see if we can
give plasma. 
</p>
<p>
One of the things to watch out for if you do got through this is the
lethargy. I&#39;ve been in a funk for most of the past month. I guess that&#39;s
because of the difficulty in sustaining focus when actually sick and
the stress even when you&#39;re feeling okay. Over this past weekend
when I was finally able to restart a number of projects is what&#39;s
making me feel I&#39;m really out of the woods. 
</p>
<p>
So, that&#39;s been our Covid-19 journey. I hope posting this provides
another data point for people - what it&#39;s like for those of us who are
getting it but have been lucky so as not to get it so bad. 
</p>
<p>
Hoping you&#39;re all staying safe and healthy.
