Got a new monitor today and wanted to share.
</p>
<p>
My old one was a 27&#34; Hanns G. Actually, the old ones - my old set up
was 2 of them side by side. When I started at Hunter, I was given a
piddly small monitor so I tried to buy my own 27&#34; Hanns G to bring in
but they were no longer available. The 27&#34; jobs available then were
much more expensive so my work monitor situation has been sadly
lacking.
</p>
<p>
The 2 27&#34; setup worked pretty well but then I read <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-best-display-for-programming-8aad0be4227d">this</a> post and did a
little research. It turns out that Costco has a great deal on an <a href="https://www.costco.com/LG-43UD79-B-43%2522-Class-Ultra-HD-4K-IPS-Monitor.product.100378322.html">LG
43&#34; 4K</a> monitor so I took the plunge. I also had to pick up a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/EVGA-GeForce-Passive-Graphics-02G-P4-6332-KR/dp/B073VPKV26/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=gt+1030&amp;qid=1552171987&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3">cheap
video card</a> to drive it since I was just using onboard video and my
setup is pretty old.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s HUGE. I love it but am now working to figure out how best to set
things up. 
</p>
<p>
The added bonus is that I can now bring one or both of the 27&#34;
monitors to work!!!!!!
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re on the  market for a new monitor I have to say that I&#39;m
really happy with the LG. Just wanted to share.
