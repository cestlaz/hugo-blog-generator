Now and again there are requests on the assorted CS Education forums
asking about which text book to use. These requests are usually for
APCS-A. There are usually a number of &#34;I&#39;m very happy with …&#34;
replies but I thought I&#39;d take a bit of a deeper dive into what
teachers might want to consider when evaluating a textbook.
</p>
<p>
It was never an issue when I started as a math teacher. The choice was
generally already made and the school had one book for each subject
level. Sometimes there were two if the school was transitioning from
one book to another.
</p>
<p>
The older books were in general more rigorous and at the same time
more terse. The newer ones were more accessible but never seemed to
give enough guidance for kids to approach the harder
problems on their own. 
</p>
<p>
In general, most teachers I know used them primarily as a source for
homework problems.
</p>
<p>
In the CS world, it seems like we have more options. 
</p>
<p>
When I first starting teaching APCS-AB at Stuy we had to buy new books
as the enrollment had just shot up. There weren&#39;t many books that
covered both the programming and the data structures but I found one
nad it was a good one:
</p>
<p>
&lt;figure class=&#34;z_image_center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;<img src="https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780314933072-uk.jpg" alt="https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780314933072-uk.jpg" title="https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780314933072-uk.jpg" />&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
</p>
<p>
It was both accessible and was thorough. It wasn&#39;t a great source of
exercises but it was no worse than the other options.
</p>
<p>
When we moved to C++ it was pretty easy as the same book was still
available, albeit now in two parts:
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;z_image_right&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31pkP2rZj5L._BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31pkP2rZj5L._BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" title="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31pkP2rZj5L._BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" />&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
</p>
<p>
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51BS6W1XRRL._SX394_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51BS6W1XRRL._SX394_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" title="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51BS6W1XRRL._SX394_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" />&#34; width=&#34;150px&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
</p>
<p>
&lt;/div&gt;
When we went to Java we couldn&#39;t find a book that covered both the
programming and the data structures but settled on this one: 
</p>
<p>
&lt;figure class=&#34;z_image_center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;<img src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/N4oAAOSw4bVTmzOV/s-l1600.jpg" alt="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/N4oAAOSw4bVTmzOV/s-l1600.jpg" title="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/N4oAAOSw4bVTmzOV/s-l1600.jpg" />&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
</p>
<p>
Nowadays, particularly with data structures no longer being in issue
at most high schools there are many more choices and even back then
there was more to consider than I&#39;m sure I realized.
</p>
<p>
When we recommend books to our colleagues we&#39;re probably not being as
helpful as we can when we say &#34;we like ….&#34;&#34;
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s important to think about how the text book is going to be
used. 
</p>
<p>
Some text books weave a project, toolkit, or theme throughout
the chapters. That&#39;s great if the teacher&#39;s going to align the course
closely with the textbook. If you don&#39;t however, it can make later
chapters harder on the students. If the text book develops, let&#39;s say,
a graphics library in the early chapters and the teacher doesn&#39;t do
the same, when the later chapters rely on this library students will
find themselves in a bit of trouble. 
</p>
<p>
Some textbooks develop these large projects or libraries but do so as
add ons to each chapter. For most teachers that&#39;s probably a better
bet.
</p>
<p>
Does the textbook have a rich set of problems, questions, and
examples? I haven&#39;t found many that are great but then it&#39;s probably
not as important these days with resources like <a href="https://codingbat.com/java">Coding Bat</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Does the textbook present material in a way similar to the teacher? If
it is, is that a good thing or not? On the one hand, it might make the
book easier for the student that&#39;s &#34;getting it&#34; in class and then the
book and the class reinforce each other. On the other hand, if I&#39;m not
connecting with a student, it&#39;s probably better if the textbook takes
on a different voice.
</p>
<p>
There are more questions one should ask themselves when desciding on a
new textbook but I think you get the idea.
</p>
<p>
For my classes, I&#39;ve never strictly used the textbook. It&#39;s more meant
as a reference and alternate resource for the kids. For this reason, I
like a book that is more on the tutorial side. I generally don&#39;t use
them for assignments but if the book has good ones, so much the
better. As we cover a unit in class, I want the book to be available
for the student who might need extra support. Nowadays, with so many
free resources out there I try to leverage them as well. For my
beginners at Hunter, I&#39;ve been using <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">this</a> and am pretty happy with it.
</p>
<p>
So, what am I missing? What else should we be considering more so than
just &#34;I like the book.&#34;
