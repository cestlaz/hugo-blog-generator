I was involved in a really exciting project a few months ago and now
that it&#39;s available, it&#39;s time to tell everyone about it.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a new book on teaching CS in K12 - <a href="https://www.shuchigrover.com/atozk12cs/">Computer Science in K12</a>. 
</p>
<p>
I got an email a few months ago from <a href="https://twitter.com/shuchig">Shuchi Grover</a>. Okay, actually a
DM over twitter. I hadn&#39;t officially met Shuchi although I&#39;m pretty
sure we&#39;ve been at the same table or group in a conference or two but
I did know her from reputation. Shuchi was putting together a book on
teaching CS in K12 and asked if I was interested in contributing a
chapter. I was flattered and honored and since I&#39;ve never written a
chapter in a book I agreed. 
</p>
<p>
The book&#39;s made up of 26 chapters with a who&#39;s who of authors
including teachers, professors, researchers, and other CS Ed adjacent
professionals. Check out the full <a href="https://www.shuchigrover.com/atozk12cs/authors/">cast of characters</a>. It was cool to
see many friends involved in the project. It should be a welcome
addition since I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything like in currently out. 
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t read the full book - I&#39;m anxiously awaiting my copy to
arrive but with chapter titles ranging from concepts like &#34;Data Structures&#34; and
&#34;Repetition and Recursion&#34; to techniques like &#34;Questions and Inquiry&#34;
and &#34;Guided Exploration Through Unplugged Activities&#34; it should be a
really valuable resource to teachers rather than just a book to use in
a class and keep on the shelf.
</p>
<p>
I worked on the chapter on functions. Once again I was paired with my
long time partner in crime JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver. Jens Monig, whom I
hadn&#39;t known prior also worked on the chapter contributing the drag
and drop material - something that neither JonAlf nor I felt
particularly comfortable with doing ourselves.
</p>
<p>
One weird thing, though it makes sense, was that I never interacted
with most of the other authors - just my chapter co-authors and
Shuchi. Nothing wrong with it but given the number of friends working
on the book and a chance to meet new friends it would have been great
to have something like a meetup at SIGCSE had it happened. On the
other hand, working with Shuchi was terrific. This not only gave me a
chance to contribute to a book but it also got us together and now I
look forward to future collaborations.
</p>
<p>
The other big take away for me was that writing the chapter was
fun. I&#39;ve been playing with the idea of writing a book on teaching CS
but wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d enjoy the process. Now I think I might and I might
get started in August when I think I&#39;ll finally have some project
time. What do all of you think?
