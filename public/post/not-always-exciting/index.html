If you check out Twitter, Facebook, Medium  and other blog sites you
might get the idea that you&#39;re the worst teacher in the world. The
internet abounds with people sharing tweets and posts about wonderful
lessons they&#39;ve just taught, witnessed or learned about in
professional development. Sure, the teacher forums rife with requests
for lesson ideas and resources but the shared material is always aces.
</p>
<p>
It makes sense, people in the community want to share things that
worked for them or things they think will work. 
</p>
<p>
Still, for new teachers it can create an unhealthy illusion of what
really goes on in the classroom.
</p>
<p>
This is not to say that sharing of the good stuff is a bad thing but
the truth is that not every lesson is a masterpiece, not every teacher
is a super charismatic showman, and not all topics lend themselves to
creative teaching.
</p>
<p>
Why am I writing this now? Because I was planning lessons earlier
today and I&#39;m at one of those places where I&#39;m not going to be able to
deliver a whiz-bang lesson in my next class. One of my classes this
semester is for beginners so we&#39;re building up language skills from
the ground up. Right now I want to do some loop applications but
there&#39;s only so much we can do given what the students know. There are
reasons why I don&#39;t want to do graphics with them right now. I also
haven&#39;t introduced lists yet and don&#39;t want to loop over strings yet
so I&#39;m left with doing mathy stuff.
</p>
<p>
I think I&#39;ll look at Newton&#39;s method for square roots. It&#39;s
interesting for the math inclined and does let us explore issues with
floating point and accuracy. 
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not going to be super exciting for everyone though and that&#39;s okay. 
</p>
<p>
I could do lists first but I don&#39;t want the kids to have to handle so
much new material so quickly. I&#39;d rather keep the pace slower and work
with what they&#39;ve just learned for a bit. 
</p>
<p>
I could also do graphics but that adds a level of overhead I don&#39;t
want to get into now.
</p>
<p>
The idea is to look at the long game. A class runs a whole semester or
possibly a year. You&#39;re going to have some special memorable lessons
and some mundane ones and that&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of. 
</p>
<p>
We&#39;re still mostly going to see best practices shared online with only
a few brave souls sharing disaster classes and asking for help. That&#39;s
just how the internet works. It&#39;s not the worst thing in the
world. Just remember when you&#39;re struggling to come up with a good
lesson or you&#39;ve just taught a bad one that tomorrow&#39;s will be
better. Judge yourself by your students long term development, not one
day at a time.
