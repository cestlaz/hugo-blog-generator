Earlier today I was reminded why I love GitHub in support of my
classes. One of my students posted a question about our current
lab. They posted a synopsis of the problem along with the error
message.
</p>
<p>
Since we&#39;re all working on GitHub the student&#39;s work was already up
online Since I started using <a href="https://classroom.github.com">GitHub Classroom</a> I was able to quickly
navigate to the repo. This might have been enough but to really in to
the students work I cloned the repo and went into Emacs. Using <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-47-magit/">Magit</a>,
Emacs&#39;s Git interface I was quickly able to navigate the project and
also see recent changes or in fact any changes to any of the student&#39;s
project files. I didn&#39;t use it this time but <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-42-git-gutter/">Git Timemachine</a> gives an
even slicker way to see the history of changes for a specific file.
</p>
<p>
With these tools it took almost no time to get the lay of the land and
figure out where the student hit the wall. From there I posted a hint to nudge the student in the
right direction.
</p>
<p>
GitHub classroom makes the student repo management easy but the other
tools were just plain old Git and Emacs. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, for this to work, students have to play their part. If a
student doesn&#39;t push their changes regularly up to GitHub I won&#39;t be
able to see the diffs and help. When they do, it&#39;s a real world tool
that once again has proven to be great at supporting education.
