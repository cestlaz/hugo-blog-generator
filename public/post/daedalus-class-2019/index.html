Now that high school seniors have all committed to their respective
colleges I though I&#39;d share some information on Hunter&#39;s incoming
Daedalus (honors CS) cohort.
</p>
<p>
I joke about the first cohort saying that nobody applied to the
program. That&#39;s kind of true. I jointed Hunter a little over three
years ago in late January. That was after high school seniors had
already applied to college and at that time the program didn&#39;t
exist. We found the first cohort by looking at students who had
already applied to Hunter not expecting Daedalus to exist.
</p>
<p>
It was 12 kids and we&#39;ve lost a few since then. 
</p>
<p>
The second cohort consisted of 24 students. We started adding
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_E._Macaulay_Honors_College">Macaulay</a> students into the mix. Macaulay is a CUNY wide honors
scholarship program. Each campus has a cohort and it was part of an
effort to bring CUNY back to it&#39;s &#34;glory days&#34; before open
enrollment. The Macaulay kids saw that Daedalus was the place to be
for CS in NYC and Hunter and wanted in. 
</p>
<p>
Third year, we were up to 44 students. 
</p>
<p>
Now, in our fourth year we&#39;re up to 50 which is a little over
capacity - at least until I can find and hire a partner in crime  (and
I am looking).
</p>

<p>
I also have stats on grades and test scores as well as the number of
offers an the percent of acceptances. 
</p>
<p>
Some thoughts on the stats:
</p>
<p>
I try to spend as much time as I can doing outreach. This is horribly
inefficient but it&#39;s slowly getting the word out. I might spend most
of a day trekking out into the boroughs to <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/fall-2018-tour-revisited/">talk to a class</a> or a few
classes at some school knowing that there will probably be very few
fits for my program. I think I&#39;m bringing important information to all
of the kids but it&#39;s a low yield activity. Right now our biggest
feeder schools are Stuyvesant, Brooklyn Tech, and Bronx Science. Next
is Midwood. This makes sense as they&#39;re all <strong>large</strong> schools and they
all have established CS classes. They&#39;ll probably continue to be the
biggest feeders but I&#39;m delighted by the fact that I&#39;m getting
students from 17 other schools including a couple from outside of
NYC. 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m less happy with the gender distribution. Twenty five percent isn&#39;t
bad compared to the national numbers but we should be doing
better. It&#39;s a tough nut to crack. When I visit to schools I&#39;m
normally sent to the CS classes so I&#39;m already getting a gender skewed
audience. Not sure the best approach to work on this. 
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, I&#39;m getting to enough of a general audience to have
roughly a 50/50 split of students with APCS-A or beyond or what I
would call a beginner. 
</p>
<p>
As I get to know this new group and find out why they applied to
Hunter Daedalus and ultimately decided to attend I&#39;m hoping to be able
to better fine tune my recruiting approach and outreach.
</p>
<p>
As a bottom line I&#39;m going to continue to work to make Hunter&#39;s
Daedalus program the place to be for CS education in NY so that kids
can get a top flight experience without paying a quarter of a million
dollars.
