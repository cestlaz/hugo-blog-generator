A couple of weeks ago I took twenty four of my first year students up
to <a href="http://catskillsconf.com">Catskills Conf</a>. As usual it was a great weekend. I particularly
enjoyed this years talks.
</p>
<p>
I found one talk particularly engaging. <a href="https://twitter.com/jordankoschei">Jordan Koschei</a> gave at talk
titled <a href="https://jordankoschei.com/2018/10/20/digital-terroir/">Digital Terroir</a>. Terroir refers to the natural envorinment in
which a wine is produced - the ground, the climate, everything. It&#39;s
why wine (and foods) produced in one location taste differently than
the same things mamde elsewhere. I first heard the term used with
respect to wine but it&#39;s also true for coffee, chocolate, tomatoes,
and I&#39;d say even the New York bagel.
</p>
<p>
Jordan talked about how terroir can be found in local crafts, music,
art, and literature and wondered if his products, as a software
developer exhibited the effects of terroir. Do web sites created in
the hudson valley have their own flavor different to those made say,
in Seattle, NYC, or California? It&#39;s an interesting
question. Unfortunately, Jordan found the answer to be no. 
</p>
<p>
His post is still very much  worth reading as it&#39;s really concerned
with uniqueness of community in a flattening world.
</p>
<p>
I wonder if Jordan would have gotten different results if he excluded
the most popular frameworks, Bootstrap, Zurb etc from his survey. 
</p>
<p>
Regardless, it got me thinking. While the products might not show
regional differences, does the process? 
</p>
<p>
Do programmers, or teachers for that matter develop styles based on
where they&#39;re from and how they were trained and taught? It&#39;s not so
farfetched an idea - it&#39;s clearly apparent in sports. I fenced and
coached fencing for many years. It was at times apparent that certain
students were from certain coaches or &#34;schools&#34; of training. You could
tell from how they fenced and their philosophy of how to compete.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m guessing that early training does contribute to a developers style
at least to a point but that&#39;s topic based. People who start off in
Object Oriented toolsets tend to solve problems one way while people
who start off with functional programming approach problems
differently. It&#39;s like a conversation I had with a friend of mine who
was on the American International Mathematical Olympiad team in the
lat 90&#39;s. He told me that one of the things he found interesting was
that the American competitors typically looked at problems first and
foremost as algebra problems while the Eastern European competitors
were just as or more likely to approach them as geometry problems. 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m wondering if it can be more teacher or local culture based. I&#39;ve
heard from more than one former student that they follow a <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/compile-each-concept/">development
loop</a> or cadence that they got from me and that it&#39;s unique in their
current workplace. I&#39;ve heard similar things about other approaches to
problems that I&#39;ve tried to model.
</p>
<p>
Going beyond me, what about the team of CS teachers at Stuy? That
school has it&#39;s own culture (as do all schools) and I think I&#39;ve had
some influence on the other teachers there. Is there a StuyCS &#34;school
of CS teaching&#34; that is similar but different to other &#34;schools of CS
teaching?&#34;
</p>
<p>
What I find particularly interesting is that we might be able to get
some answers, at least on the teacher side of the equation in the
coming years. We&#39;re hoping to roll out our teacher certification
programs at Hunter very soon and I&#39;m going to be relying on my Stuy
teachers to work with me to teach our first few cohorts of teacher
candidates. 
</p>
<p>
Will those teacher candidates show that there is indeed a unique
character to our way of developing CS teachers and later to their ways
of teaching their students? Time will tell. Maybe we&#39;ll find out if
indeed teaching and programming has some roots in terroir.
