<p>
I&#39;m not hiring for a tech company but I thought I&#39;d share some
thoughts anyway.
</p>
<p>
A bunch of years ago, I was at a big meeting at the NYCDOE. It was
related to the creation of AFSE. The meeting was attended by a bunch
of NY Tech company heavyweights, DOE people, and me. At this point in
the project, the DOE was pushing the school as one that would produce
&#34;Google ready&#34; software engineers from high school. They were also
insisting on no academic screen so many students would be coming in
multiple years below grade level. 
</p>
<p>
I contended that you could have a great school without a screen but it
was horribly unrealistic to expect to produce &#34;Google ready&#34; engineers
from an incoming class that&#39;s starting far below grade level and it&#39;s
wrong t say you will. Either don&#39;t have a screen and don&#39;t make such
ridiculous claims or if you really intend to deliver, have some manner
of screen.
</p>
<p>
So, during the meeting, the DOE wanted to sell the idea that academic
performance wasn&#39;t important to the tech community and this is where
this post meets Ria&#39;s tweet. 
</p>
<p>
One of the DOE reps asked the company &#34;What do you look for in a
potential hire? Things like creativity, right?&#34; 
</p>
<p>
The tech company took the bait. They responded as the DOE planned:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
creativity
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
teamwork
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
hard working
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
reliable
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
and so on. A long list of soft skills and truth be told, I agreed that
these things were and are important.
</p>
<p>
The DOE people thought that there point was made but I had other
plans. I asked a follow up question:
</p>
<p>
&#34;Where do you look for these kids?&#34;
</p>
<p>
At which point the tech people responded:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Stanford
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
MIT
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
CMU
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
etc.
</p>
<p>
These companies recruited exclusively at institutions that already did
extreme academic prescreening. The soft skills are important but they
take on even more importance when you&#39;ve already narrowed your search
down to &#34;kids who made it in and through MIT.&#34;  None of the
applicants they considered topped out barely passing 10th grade math.
</p>
<p>
Some of the tech people at the meeting got the point. Some didn&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re only going to recruit from the &#34;usual suspects&#34; you&#39;re never
going to expand the pool, never going to achieve a diverse talent
pool, and never really provide opportunities to a huge number of
terrific young people who don&#39;t have the ivy league pedigree.
</p>
<p>
I had a related conversation with a friend of mine recently where I tried to
further drive home the point. He was talking about how important it
was for a young student who wanted to break into tech to have side
projects - how that an extensive portfolio would always catch his
eye. I told him that this eliminates many terrific low income
students.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s easy to ask a well to do kid to spend free time on either a
portfolio, activity or project (and I&#39;ll note that a non-tech project
or activity can be as or more impressive and important than a tech
one) but a low income kid probably has to work and their job is likely
not going to further their tech careers. Require the side project,
eliminate the poor kid.
</p>
<p>
All of this is to say that it&#39;s really hard to say that even when a
hiring agent looks for something, there&#39;s a lot more going on behind
the scenes. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve become very aware of at Hunter and
something I&#39;ve been trying to push the NY Tech community to
understand.
