What can I do to discourage my students from using the &#34;break&#34;

<p>
That was more or less the gist of the comment and it elicited some
good responses. This time the conversation was on Facebook but I&#39;ve
seen this one and participated in it many times before. I never liked
the question when presented as a &#34;how can I stop them&#34; one.  I equally
dislike when the offered advice is basically &#34;never use break no
matter what&#34; or something similar. When writing code the best advice
is rarely to never or always do something. The question should really
be &#34;when is it appropriate for my students to use a break statement
and how can I steer them  towards using it correctly.&#34; The answer, of
course is &#34;it depends.&#34;
</p>
<p>
For those unfamiliar with the statements, <code>break</code> jumps to the end and
exits the loop or switch statement that encloses it. The <code>continue</code>
statement jumps up to the next iteration of its enclosing loop. I&#39;ll
show some examples below.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s true that you never <strong>need</strong> to use break but in my opinion, if
used correctly it can create clearer code. Let&#39;s look at a related
situation. Suppose you write a function to find and return some item
from  a data set (in pseudocode):
</p>
<div class="src src-java">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
You could tighten it up a bit but there are two things that I don&#39;t
like about the above solution. First, it goes through the entire data
set even if the item you&#39;re searching for is near the beginning. You
could fix that by putting in a more complex loop boolean:
</p>
<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> <span style="color:#f92672">(</span>i<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>0<span style="color:#f92672">;</span> i <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span> numitems <span style="color:#f92672">&amp;&amp;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">!</span>found <span style="color:#f92672">;</span> i<span style="color:#f92672">++)</span> <span style="color:#f92672">...</span></code></pre></div>
</p>
<p>
Second. you&#39;ve got the conditional after the loop. I find the
following much clearer:
</p>
<div class="src src-java">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">  </code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
To me this is perfectly clear. Look for an item, if and when we find
it, we&#39;re done so let&#39;s get out of here. If not, the loop finishes and
we return the not found stuff at the end. It&#39;s clean, easy to
understand, and potentially a little faster.
</p>
<p>
You have a similar situation with <code>break</code>. Without it you might have
code like this:
</p>
<div class="src src-java">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">  </code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
And with:
</p>
<div class="src src-java">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">  </code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Not significantly different. 
</p>
<p>
People who don&#39;t like the break statement usually adhere to a very
strict interpretation of structured programming - one entry point, one
exit point but I&#39;d argue that break (and continue) are not like
arbitrary jumps. They&#39;re well defined and don&#39;t introduce spaghetti
code. They either specifically exit a bounding language construct or
jump to the next iteration. Actually, now that I think about it,
<code>exceptions</code> can be used in a way that mucks with clear code in a much
more dangerous way than break and continue can.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s an example with continue:
</p>
<div class="src src-java">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    </code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
as opposed to:
</p>
<div class="src src-java">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    </code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Which is better? It&#39;s purely subjective. Nothing wrong with either.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll share a final example. This one lifted from an <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/globals-breaks-and-returns/">older post</a> on
&#34;best practices.&#34; If you&#39;re writing an event handler, you could put
the exit event in the loop boolean but I find including it
as a case using a <code>break</code> to be cleaner:
</p>
<div class="src src-c++">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c++" data-lang="c++">
</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
At the end of the day, <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>, like most langauge
constructs can be used for either good or evil. There have been times
when they&#39;ve led me to cleaner code so I&#39;ve used them. At other times,
using them would have been forced.
</p>
<p>
If we agree that <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> can be appropriate, the other
question is when to introduce them. One comment from the most recent
Facebook thread on this (name withheld since that&#39;s a semi-private
forum) was that it shouldn&#39;t be right off the bat but rather after
they&#39;re comfortable with loops, conditionals and booleans so that they
can use the new constructs when they make sense and not willy-nilly. I
tend to agree with this.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I think it&#39;s important to show our kids constructs like
<code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> and it&#39;s also important for us to talk about
good code and <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/best-practices-cli/">best practices</a> but the important thing is that we don&#39;t
have our kids blindly follow any practice but empower them to make good
decisions based on their situations.
