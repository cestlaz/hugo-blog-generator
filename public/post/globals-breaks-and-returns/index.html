<ul>
<li>
<p>
Never use global variables
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Never break out of a loop
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These are two &#34;best practices&#34; that are frequently touted in early CS
classes both at the high school and college level.
</p>
<p>
They came up a couple of times yesterday. Once in the Facebook APCS-A
teachers group and once on <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2018/10/if-you-are-using-global-variables-you.html">Alfred Thompson</a>&#39;s blog.
</p>
<p>
Alfred post was topically on global variables. Actually it was deeper than just global
variables. It&#39;s also about how students progress - what they can figure
out at various stages of progress and how what seems like a good idea
early on the path to computer science doesn&#39;t seem so great later on.
</p>
<p>
The discussion on the APCS-A group started with a discussion of this
code and its <code>break</code> statement as opposed to having the loop&#39;s exit
condition in the boolean up top:
</p>
<div class="src src-java">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">  <span style="color:#66d9ef">while</span> <span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">true</span><span style="color:#f92672">)</span>
      <span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
          <span style="color:#75715e">// do stuff
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>          <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> <span style="color:#f92672">(</span>condition<span style="color:#f92672">)</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">break</span><span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
      <span style="color:#f92672">}</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
These two &#34;best practices&#34; - not using globals and not breaking out of
loops are frequently taught to students at a point when reasons for
the best practice aren&#39;t always clear. 
</p>
<p>
Actually, these aren&#39;t even universally best practices.
</p>
<p>
Looking at the while loop, You might have event driven code with a
while loop acting as a dispatcher:
</p>
<div class="src src-java">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">  <span style="color:#66d9ef">while</span> <span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">true</span><span style="color:#f92672">){</span>
      <span style="color:#75715e">// do stuff
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>
      <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> <span style="color:#f92672">(</span>some event<span style="color:#f92672">)</span>
          <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> that event<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>

      <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> <span style="color:#f92672">(</span>some other event<span style="color:#f92672">)</span>
          <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> that event<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>

      <span style="color:#75715e">// etc
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>
      <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> <span style="color:#f92672">(</span>exit event<span style="color:#f92672">)</span>
          <span style="color:#66d9ef">break</span><span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
  <span style="color:#f92672">}</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Nothing wrong with that structure. It&#39;s clean, easy to read and easy
to reason about. 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen loops that use extra variables and crazy boolean expressions
so as to avoid using a <code>break</code> statement so that they follow the &#34;best
practice&#34; but end up with much messier code.
</p>
<p>
This is not to say that you should always use <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code> for that matter but rather that the best practice should be to
consider if it makes the code cleaner, easier to read, and more
maintainable or not. 
</p>
<p>
On the global front things are also not so clear. Sure, storing
information in globals  and then using them indiscriminantly in
assorted methods or functions is both bad form and dangerous but there
are times when using globals make sense. 
</p>
<p>
Back in &#34;the day&#34; I was a C programmer. I used single C source files
along with their matching .h include files to enable <strong>object typed</strong>
programming. Each file was a singleton object. Functions in the file
were methods using some naming convention to demarcate public vs
private, and variables that were global to the file as class variables
(or instance variables but there was only ever one instance of any
given class). Technically I broke the rules but the technique was very
effective and allowed me to write large maintainable systems. 
</p>
<p>
More recently I&#39;ve been playing with <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> for front end
development. Vue uses a central data store - Vuex to maintain
state. Basically a place for global variables to manage the state of
your application. Again, technically global but with rules and
protocols to make things work without the usual danger associated with
globals.

A great comment on the Facebook thread <sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> included this Hal
Ableson quote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&#34;Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.&#34; 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
and noted that this is particularly true on the AP Exam and after all,
the original question was posed on a forum about APCS-A. With this in
mind, you shouldn&#39;t <strong>try</strong> to use globals or cleverly or creatively 
use <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code> but they do have their places.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve used globals in both professional and personal work when
appropriate and I don&#39;t shy away from <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> and use
them regularly. The real <strong>best practice</strong> is that you consider why you
are or aren&#39;t using these constructs and make a choice that makes
sense for you, your group, or your team.
