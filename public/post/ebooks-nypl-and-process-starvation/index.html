I&#39;m a big fan of E Ink e-readers. I had one a number of years ago. An <a href="https://www.mobiletechreview.com/gadgets/Astak-EZ-Reader.htm">Aztak EZ
Reader</a>. It was great. Small, cheap, and independent - that is, not
tied in to Amazon or Barnes and Nobles and I found myself doing a lot
more recreational reading with it. I still preferred paper for
technical books but for easy reading  there was nothing like having
tons of reading options always available.
</p>
<p>
Alas it sadly committed suicide by diving from my hand onto the hard
stone floor of the NY Post office as I waited on the passport line. I
tried other e-readers since then but found E ink so much easier on the
eyes. Not wanting to do my usual &#34;schlepp all the books I might want
to read&#34; on vacation a few years ago, I bit the bullet and bought a
kindle. 
</p>
<p>
When I originally had the EZ-Reader I loaded it with mostly public
domain books. With the Kindle, I have purchased a small number of
books from Amazon to go along with all sorts of goodies from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project
Gutenberg</a> but there&#39;s also been one HUGE change in the landscape. The
<a href="https://nypl.overdrive.com/">New York Public Library</a>.  Public libraries are some of our greatest
public goods and it&#39;s unfortunate that they&#39;re perpetually
underfunded. Where else can a kid or indeed anyone go on any given day
and spend time indoors with no expectation of spending money. What&#39;s
more in addition to books and now movies and sometimes games they
provide all manner of community services and programs to and for the
public. In terms of e-books though, you can use the NYPL without
leaving the comfort of your home.
</p>
<p>
NYPL has a web site where you can search for and take out ebooks and
have them sent right to your kindle for 28 days at a time. If they
don&#39;t have enough copies - something of a ludicrous point for a
digital resource, you can place it on hold. If it&#39;s close to being
due, you can renew it unless someone else is on the queue at which
point the renewal request becomes a hold request. It&#39;s all rather
seamless.
</p>
<p>
My reading habits now regularly include taking out books from the
library and that&#39;s led to an interesting resource issue - process
starvation.
</p>
<p>
In case there are any on CS people reading this, everything running on
your computer at any point in time is a process. Each process gets a
small slice of computer time and it appears that the computer is
running everything at once. Some processes have a higher priority and
can get a bigger slice of time. On older &#34;batch processing&#34; systems,
high priority processes or jobs would run before lower priority
ones. For example, in a university setting, jobs submitted by
professors would be run before jobs submitted by grad students before
those submitted by undergrads. 
</p>
<p>
This of course could lead to some processes never getting run if
higher priority jobs keep getting submitted. There&#39;s an apocryphal
story about a computer at MIT that had a job submitted in 1967 but
still hadn&#39;t run in 1973.
</p>
<p>
So what&#39;s happening to me? I have a number of free books just sitting
on my kindle as well as books that I&#39;ve purchased. My friend Paul said
I had to read &#34;Algorithms to Live By&#34; so that&#39;s thre. So is &#34;Captains
Courageous&#34; because I think I want to read it. There are also a bunch of
others. The trouble is, I keep seeing books that I want to read in the
library and I only have a 28 day window to read them, Most recently it
was &#34;Sapiens&#34; but before that it was &#34;Turn Right at Machi Picchu&#34; and
I read that right after &#34;How Chance and Stupidity Have Changed
History,&#34; &#34;The Witch of Lime Street.&#34; and &#34;The Man with the Sawed-Off
Leg and Other Tales of a New York City Block.&#34; As soon as, or before I
finish one, there&#39;s a new one on hold and then on loan and the books I
own keep getting pushed back.
</p>
<p>
Operating Systems usually implement process aging. If a job isn&#39;t
handled fdor a long period of time its priority is increased. This
means that eventually it will be run. I guess I could do that and just
force myself to not read the next hot library book but I don&#39;t kow if
I have that in me.
