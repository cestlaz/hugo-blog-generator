I wasn&#39;t supposed to be in NYC this week. I was supposed to be in
Arlington Virginia with around one thousand of my CS Teacher friends
at CSTA2020. Devorah was going to spend the days at the GitHub booth
<a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/blanket-statement-2020/">teaching knitting</a> and I was going to do a GitHub workshop and
generally enjoy the show
</p>
<p>
Of course nobody&#39;s traveling these days and CSTA2020 is running
remote. This is my second virtual conference as I attended parts of MongoDB
world a few weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still forming my opinion on CSTA2020 but I thought I&#39;d share my
thoughts in progress.
</p>
<p>
To start, virtual conferences aren&#39;t the same as in person - they
can&#39;t be. For me, CSTA is a person first conference rather than
session first. That is, I get most of my value from the hallway
track. That&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t enjoy the sessions, it&#39;s just that
for me personally, I get more from the chats than from the talks. By
contrast, for me SIGCSE is more about the sessions. There are a few
reasons why things fall this way but there neither here nor there.
</p>
<p>
So, since there can&#39;t really be a hallway track, I was wondering how
CSTA2020 would feel. 
</p>
<p>
TL;DR - it&#39;s different but still pretty great.
</p>
<p>
Keynote&#39;s are keynotes wether virtual or in person so not much to say
in them so let&#39;s move to the sessions. CSTA is using hopin.to and it&#39;s
working pretty well. MongoDB used another platform that seemed to be
more glitchy. Hopin&#39;s been working pretty seamlessly for me. I&#39;m
presenting tomorrow so we&#39;ll see if that changes my view. None of the
sessions I attended brought any participants &#34;on stage&#34; so
interactions were through the chat. It worked pretty well but at times
there was so much chatter that things flew off the screen before you
could read them.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I&#39;m digging the plaltform. Not the same as in person but it&#39;s
a good approximation.
</p>
<p>
The vendor / exhibit area worked pretty much the same way so not much
to say there. 
</p>
<p>
Overall the interface is pretty smooth. Navigation could be smoother
and so could user search but overall, pretty nice.
</p>
<p>
So, where are we at? We&#39;ve got a pretty good platform for sessions
with decent navigation, chat, and messaging but what about that
hallway track. 
</p>
<p>
We don&#39;t have one but we have a pretty cool alternative. Hopin has a
networking feature. When you drop in, you&#39;re matched with someone else
randomly for a 5 minute video chat. After five minutes, its over. You
can come back in and chat with someone else or be done with it.
</p>
<p>
I really like this feature.
</p>
<p>
For someone asocial and somewhat awkward like me, it&#39;s great. Five
minutes isn&#39;t too long to get awkward but it&#39;s enough for a brief chat
and you can follow up later. The randomness lets you meet new people.
</p>
<p>
In some ways it&#39;s better than in person. I frequently fly solo at
conferences. At this point I know a decent amount of people but when
at a new conference, it&#39;s hard to break in. The reason is that many
colleges or schools send groups of teachers and they cluster together
making it hard for an individual to join in. I see it and fee it all
the time, With this platform, you&#39;re dumped in one on one - no worries
about cliques. 
</p>
<p>
So, what&#39;s the verdict. 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m loving the networking feature and liking the overall tool. I hope
CSTA&#39;s in person next year but I&#39;ll be a happy attendee even if we
remain remote.
