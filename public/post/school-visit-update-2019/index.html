I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time at area high schools this fall. Today
I was at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt_High_School_(New_York_City)">FDR High School</a> in Broooklyn.
</p>

&lt;/figure&gt;
</p>
<p>
I only learned about FDR HS a little over a year ago when I met their
CS teacher <a href="https://twitter.com/jhans404">Josh Hans</a> at a NYC PD event. I visit last fall and then
again today.
</p>
<p>
Whenever I visit a school it&#39;s a different experience. Sometimes I
speak to the CS classes, sometimes at an event like a CS Week
hackathon, once I even got to address an entire senior class in an
auditorium. 
</p>
<p>
I really loved how Josh and FDR set things up for me today.
</p>
<p>
Before I get to the arrangement, let&#39;s talk about the talk.
</p>
<p>
When I meet with a room of seniors, even a room full of CS students, I
know that only a few students are going to end up with me at
Hunter. A room of 30 seniors should probably end up in something like
25 different colleges. I also know that even in a CS class many of
the students will end up pursuing other majors.
</p>
<p>
I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s right for me to take a full class period and
talk just about Hunter and my Daedalus program so instead I start by
talking about college choices. I try to share things that I&#39;ve learned
over my career as a student, teacher, parent, and now someone reading
applications with my audiuence. Things I&#39;ve learned from both my
experiences and through my relationships with former students. At the
end we talk about Hunter, Hunter CS and the Daedalus program.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been told that the approach has been really valuable to the
majority of students I&#39;ve delivered it to.
</p>
<p>
There were a few things that Josh set up today that made it a lot of
fun. First, we were in the auditorium. I had Josh&#39;s APCS-A class but
he also invited a couple of others. I also had APCS-P students and
also a class of Calculus students. This was a big deal. Just like
everyone, I&#39;m working hard to build a program with a diverse
population and sometimes outreach is difficult. Specifically, if a
school only allows me to speak with their APCS-A students, I
frequently end up with a pre-culled group. If a school, for example,
has a very low percentage of women in their APCS-A class and that&#39;s
where I&#39;m speaking, I&#39;m not going to be able to convince many women to
look into what we&#39;re offering. By having the calc sutdents in the
audience I had a more diverse audience and also almost certainly had
the chance to expose some students to CS in a new and different
way. Now, don&#39;t get me wrong. Given the nature of my program, I really
love talking to APCS-A students and going with probability, they&#39;re
the most likely the ones to want my program but I love casting the
wider net.
</p>
<p>
The other think Josh did was he gave me two periods. My talk usually
takes most of a period with little time for discussion. It should take
less but I tend to go into yammer mode and start telling
stories. Sorry - it&#39;s just what I do. With two periods we had plenty
of time for discussion afterwards. What&#39;s more, after most of the
students left, I was left with about 6 students who wanted to continue
to talk. I really enjoyed that. 
</p>
<p>
Once I was done I did what I usually do - went to the local bakery to
bring home some baked goods. I stopped at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/18th+Avenue+Bakery/@40.6212881,-73.9847415,17z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sbakery!3m4!1s0x0:0xd4dca91422790dec!8m2!3d40.6217849!4d-73.9877902">18th street Bakery</a>. An
Italian place and got an assortment. Also had a great chat with the
lady at the counter. It reminded me of when I&#39;d go to <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/moishes-kosher-bakery-new-york">Moishes Bakery</a>
before they closed albeit Italian rather than Jewish. 
</p>
<p>
I pointed to a pile of cookes and asked &#34;what are these?&#34; and she
merely said &#34;No!!!!!&#34; We joked back and forth and she explained that
they were on the older side and didn&#39;t feel right selling them and was
going to throw the rest of the batch out. They&#39;d bake new ones for
tomorrow. I was disappointed not to try a new cookie but glad that I
wasn&#39;t sold stale goods. It was like at Moishes when I once asked
about the Babka and was told &#34;that was made  on Wednesday, you don&#39;t
want it. This is what&#39;s fresh. New Babka tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
So, then, on the way home, thinking about Moishes and realizing that
there were  also Jewish bakeries in the neighborhood I decided to see
if I could find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kichel">Kichel</a> - one of Devorah&#39;s favorite cookies. I
sometimes make them but haven&#39;t in a while. I found some at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Korn&#39;s+Bakery/@40.630628,-73.9799457,17z/data=!4m9!1m3!2m2!1sbakery!6e5!3m4!1s0x0:0xf6f303e4b6cd6dfe!8m2!3d40.6308331!4d-73.9764149">Korn&#39;s</a>
Bakery and then it was back into Manhattan.
</p>
<p>
So, overall a succesful day. I got to talk to a bunch of great High
School cookies and got tasty neighborhood baked goods. 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve hit a bunch of schools already this fall as I work to spread the
gospel about CS and about Hunter&#39;s <a href="http://info.huntercs.org">Daedalus</a> program and am still
looking to get more on the schedule so if you know a school that&#39;s a
good fit a visit, hit me up.
