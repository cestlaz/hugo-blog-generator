Lat day of the 2019 <a href="https://www.ncwit.org/summit/2019-ncwit-summit-women-and-it">NCWIT Summmit</a>. Got up crazy early, got back from
my run and saw this when I checked Twitter:

I don&#39;t usually participate in Twitter chats. The format doesn&#39;t
really work for me. I do frequently lurk though and while I didn&#39;t see
this tweet until the morning after, another <a href="https://twitter.com/Todd_Lash/status/1128816582048673793">one</a> by my <a href="https://twitter.com/Todd_Lash">Todd Lash</a> caught
my eye and I&#39;ll probably comment on that at some point in the near
future.
</p>
<p>
On Sarah&#39;s tweet I&#39;ll say that CS teachers should certainly frequent
Alfred and Mark&#39;s blogs. I subscribe to and enjoy both. I&#39;ll add
something that I&#39;ve said before and that is if you&#39;re a CS teacher you
should also blog.
</p>
<p>
I get it - it takes time, it&#39;s hard to put yourself out there and if you&#39;re a
relatively young teacher you might feel like you don&#39;t have much to
say but I say so what.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been blogging on and off for nine years now. I have no reason to
believe I have anything more than a small readership but I do
periodically get surprised at a conference with a &#34;hey, I love your
blog.&#34; Comments are few and far between and from &#34;the usual
suspects&#34; but as I sad above, so what.
</p>
<p>
Pick a lesson you just did and describe it. That&#39;s all it takes. Try
something different a week later? Write it up. Rinse and repeat.
</p>
<p>
Why have I found writing a blog to be good self-PD?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Writing the experience or the lesson makes me think through it
again. What worked, what didn&#39;t.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When I do a similar lesson in the future, I can look back on what I
did. It helps in iterating towards becoming a better teacher.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I get to see how I&#39;ve evolved as a teacher over time. You don&#39;t get
this immediately but blog for a few years and then reread some early
posts. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
You could get some comments. I don&#39;t get a lot but the ones people
have left have proven useful to me. Some of the ones from people who
disagree have been the most useful.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
On top of this, some other new teacher might discover something you
wrote up and find inspiration from it. 
</p>
<p>
So, jump in and try it. Blogging for self-PD.
