Today&#39;s <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/3">problem</a> dealt with intersecting paths. You start with two
inputs, figure out the paths they represent and where they intersect
and then find the intersection that correctly answers the question.
</p>
<p>
For part 1 you have to find the intersection closest to the
origin. From a teacher&#39;s point of view, the interesting part here is
data representation. This problem deals with a two dimensional grid on
which the paths live. For most students, at least in my experience, if
they&#39;re trained in a language like C++ or Java they go for the direct
representation - a 2D array. For many problems this makes a lot of
sense. For this one, however, it probably doesn&#39;t. We start at a
specific point but can travel in any direction for any distance. This
means we might need a crazy large array and what&#39;s more, it&#39;s probably
going to be sparsely filled.
</p>
<p>
A more practical solution involves maintaining a data structure with
just the individual points of interest - the points on the path. 
</p>
<p>
I chose a dictionary (or hash-map or hash-table depending on language)
The key would be a tuple representing a point and the value would hold
whatever data was needed. For part one that would be a set of the
paths that went through the point. 
</p>
<p>
So, if we had a path made up of 2 intersecting lines:
</p>
<div class="src src-ditaa">
<pre><code class="language-ditaa" data-lang="ditaa"> |
-+-----
 |</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
We could use a 2D array to represent it (assume the lines have ID&#39;s 1
and 2):
</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="align-right"></th>
<th>0</th>
<th>1</th>
<th>2</th>
<th>3</th>
<th>4</th>
<th>5</th>
<th>6</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="align-right">0</td>
<td>nil</td>
<td>#{2}</td>
<td>nil</td>
<td>nil</td>
<td>nil</td>
<td>nil</td>
<td>nil</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="align-right">1</td>
<td>#{1}</td>
<td>#{1 2}</td>
<td>#{1}</td>
<td>#{1}</td>
<td>#{1}</td>
<td>#{1}</td>
<td>#{1}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="align-right">2</td>
<td>nil</td>
<td>#{2}</td>
<td>nil</td>
<td>nil</td>
<td>nil</td>
<td>nil</td>
<td>nil</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
That&#39;s already a good deal of wasted space. using a dictionarey we&#39;d
have:
</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>key (row,col)</th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>(0,1)</td>
<td>#{2}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(1,0)</td>
<td>#{1}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(1,1)</td>
<td>#{1 2}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(1,2)</td>
<td>#{1}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(1,3)</td>
<td>#{1}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(1,4)</td>
<td>#{1}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(1,5()</td>
<td>#{1}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(1,6)</td>
<td>#{1}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(2,1)</td>
<td>#{2}</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
Which becomes much more space efficient once we go beyond the smallest
test cases.
</p>
<p>
Once we have the representation, the problem becomes one of stepping
through the paths and adding them to the dictionary. After that we can
pull out the small number of entries in our dictionary that were
visited by both paths and then we can find the final answer.
</p>
<p>
I coded this up in Clojure <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/advent2019/blob/master/day03.clj">(solution here)</a> but forgot to account for the fact that
when a path repeats itself it shouldn&#39;t count as an intersection for
the purpose of the problem. Oops. I fudged things to get the right
answer but then had to head off to Albany.
</p>
<p>
When I arrived I fixed the code but was pretty zonked so decide to
code the second part in Python <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/advent2019/blob/master/day03.py">(solution here)</a>. Both solutions are pretty similar but
as I&#39;m more comfortable with Python it didn&#39;t require too much focus
to get it right.
</p>
<p>
Given the wording of this problem, I think that most people will steer
towards the type of dictionary representation I used rather than a 2D
array but this way of storing data is worth discussing with classes
when you might otherwise use a 2D array.
</p>
<p>
When might you ask?
</p>
<p>
How about something like Conway&#39;s Game of Life. When this is done in a
CS1 class the world is usually represented as a 2D array. It&#39;s simple
 and direct. Another approach would be to only store the live cells in
a list. You can check out a Clojurescript implementation that does
just that <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/clojure-life/tree/master/src">here</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Another would be the N-Queens problem. Insead of a board, just store
the queens locations. 
</p>
<p>
Image processing? Well, there probably not. When doing image work,
you actually use all the cells in the 2D array.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s pretty much all I have to say about today&#39;s problem. It got me
thinking about alternate ways of representing our data. That&#39;s
something we usually don&#39;t have too much of an opportunity to discuss
with our students. That&#39;s unfortunate.
