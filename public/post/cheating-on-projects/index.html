Alfred Thompson posted today about <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2019/09/the-problem-of-cheating-on-programming.html">cheating on CS class projects</a>. It
was in response to Garth Flint&#39;s post on <a href="https://gflint.wordpress.com/2019/09/26/finding-cool-projects-for-programming-classes/">finding interesting projects</a>
which in turn referenced earlier posts by Alfred and me.
</p>
<p>
Garth laments that it&#39;s hard to find projects that are both
interesting and meaty but where solutions can&#39;t easily be searched for
online. Alfred notes that cheating will happen and that it&#39;s an ethics
issue. This is why I try to create a culture of sharing and
acknowledging credit (that is, citing sources) but I&#39;m not naive
enough to believe there isn&#39;t any cheating in my classes.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t go nuts looking out for cheating but there are a number of
things I do to try to help keep the students honest.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Class time. More often than not students have some time in class to
work on any given project. This lets me get a handle on what they
actually know since I can interact with the student or team and
observe them interacting with each other. Even if a particular
project is all done out of class, over the course of the semester
you can get a pretty good idea as to what a student will produce on
their own.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Project quizzes. For a big project, I&#39;ll sometimes give a quiz on
the day it&#39;s due. The quiz will be tied to the project - describe
a data structure or algorithm you used. If the student wrote the
project it&#39;s free points, if not they&#39;ll have problems. Of course,
this only requires that a student understands their project not
that they actually wrote it but at least that&#39;s something.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Git logs. I get my students on GitHub early and that lets me look
at the commit logs for any given project. This usually can&#39;t be
used to find cheating but it lets me see what was committed when. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Be reasonable in terms of workload and expectations. <strong>This is a
really important one</strong>. Back at Stuy, it was made clear to me many
times that many students feel forced to cheat due to teachers
expecting far too much from them. If you&#39;re take 6 classes a day
and each gives you two hours of homework somethings got to give.
</p>
<p>
I always try to give a fair amount of work and only if I think it&#39;s
necessary and makes sense and as long a a student is up front about
any issues that arise I&#39;ll try to work with them on deadlines and
requirements.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I could use a code plagiarism tester like <a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/">Moss</a> but I usually don&#39;t
bother.
</p>
<p>
I also try to keep things in perspective. Usually things come clean in
the end. Most classes have multiple measures - tests, homework,
projects, classwork and more. Even if a student copies a project and
gets away with it, it&#39;s just one measure and it likely won&#39;t move the
needle all that much. True, a kid who&#39;s doing well might feel the need
to cheat on one assignment (see item 4 above) but that&#39;s not a hill
I&#39;m willing to die on.
</p>
<p>
Even if a kid in a 10th grade intro CS class cheats their way through
they&#39;ll unlikely take any more CS as they&#39;ll be woefully
unprepared. In that case, the one higher grade they got on their
transcript due to cheating on CS projects probably won&#39;t make much of
an overall difference and it certainly won&#39;t hurt the kids who take
all your school&#39;s CS courses and apply to college to be CS majors.
</p>
<p>
None of this is to say that cheating doesn&#39;t happen and I do believe
we should keep an eye out and address it if and when it rares its ugly
head. I&#39;m just saying keep things in perspective. 
</p>
<p>
When I pick projects I don&#39;t pay much attention to if they can be
found online and I&#39;m not the tightest screw when it comes to enforcing
the rules in my classes. I know that&#39;s led to my being taken advantage
of over the years and yes, that does bother me but I&#39;d rather put my
time and energy into the kids trying to do it right than those cutting
the corners.
