It made me think of a couple of conversations I had with more senior
teachers early in my career.
</p>
<p>
They&#39;d tell me &#34;by and large, you know what the kids are going to get
after a few week.&#34; By and large they were right. Sure there were some
kids that would turn it on midway and raise end up earning a higher
grade and some who fell off a cliff but for the most part, you knew
pretty early. 
</p>
<p>
This doesn&#39;t mean that you don&#39;t need assessments along the way - both
to inform the student on how they&#39;re doing and to inform both teacher
and student on how to best proceed in order to benefit the student. Of
course, sometimes, even when you present some students will their dire
situations they can remain in denial for a remarkable period of time.
</p>
<p>
At Stuy, the standing grading policy was 2 full period exams each marking
period - this meant at least 6 a semester. Add to that a final which
usually counted as two tests and we had more than enough to drop the
lowest grade - a practice followed by many teachers. Depending on
subject you&#39;d also add in papers, projects, quizes, Homework,
participation and anything else you&#39;d like weighted in a variety of ways.
</p>
<p>
As an interesting aside, I was able to evaluate my senior classes at Stuy
entirely on projects - no tests but not my sophomore classes. Stuy
students were so conditioned on exams that they really needed them to
keep themselves honest. It took time to ween them off. 
</p>
<p>
I started at Seward Park High School and that school had a similar policy. 
</p>
<p>
In any event, those teachers that told me that you&#39;d know the final
grades early on were pretty spot on. A number of times I tried an
experiment - for final grades, I&#39;d first write down what I thought the
grades would be and then I ran all the assessments through the
weighted average formula. The &#34;guesses&#34; were almost always pretty spot
on.  I also compared the final grades to the second marking period
grades. I chose the second because the first marking period grades
were just letters - E for excellent, S satisfactory, N needs
improvement, and U. There was some movement but it was more from my
grading up or down due to the amrking period rather than a real
change. I would grade down in the second marking period and up in the
third.  
</p>
<p>
This isn&#39;t to say that Cory&#39;s suggestion doesn&#39;t make sense and it
also doesn&#39;t mean that I or other teachers are fabulous estimators -
for all I know, I was biasing some subjective students grades based on
some preconceived notion I wasn&#39;t aware of making the final grade a
self fulfilling prophecy. 
</p>
<p>
In any event, I was able to do this when I was teaching in high school
but not so far in college. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve only been at Hunter
for three years and I developed my high school chops over
decades. Maybe it&#39;s because I have far less contact time with the
students - 2 days a week for an hour fifteen vs five days a week for
43 minutes a shot. It could be that there were more opportunities for
assessment in high school due to more contact time. I&#39;m really not
sure. Something to ponder further.
