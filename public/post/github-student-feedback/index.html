            <p>
Beyond the CS specifics We&#39;ve been primarily using three tools in our
summer certification program.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Zoom for video conferencing
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Slack for text based communicaiton
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
GitHub for just about everything else
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
We use GitHub as a CMS - a place to share code and assignments as well
as collect them. We&#39;re also playing with GitHub discussions although
that&#39;s fallen somewhat to the wayside with Slack being preferred. 
</p>
<p>
One of the choices I&#39;m digging more than ever is <a href="https://classroom.github.com/">GitHub Classroom</a> for
assignments. Recently GitHub added a feedback feature powered through
what known as Pull Requests. You just have to check the &#34;feedback&#34;
button when you create an assignment. I also set my notifications so I
receive an email alert whenever a students submits anything.
</p>
<p>
Whenever a student updates an assignment or in Git parlance commits
and pushes up a change, I get an email alert. The email includes: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
The repo where the change was made 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A brief message describing the most recent change
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A link the the students GitHub account
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A link to the actual change.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Clicking on the change and I get to a screen like this:
</p>
<p>
<figure>
    <img src="/img/githubdiff.png"/> 
</figure>

</p>
<p>
A summary of exactly what changed. I see lines that were deleted,
lines that were added and lines that were modified. At the top I see
the one line brief description which the student put in when making
the commit. I can also easily navigate through their assignment both
to see other parts of it as well as earlier versions.
</p>
<p>
If you scroll down the page there&#39;s a place you can leave a comment
which will go to the student. 
</p>
<p>
This all makes for a very quick and easy feedback mechanism. You can
also go to the &#34;pull request&#34; section of the repo (link at the top of
the repo page) where you can find all the comments.
</p>
<p>
All in all this provides a very quick and painless way of seeing what
students are up to and a quick way to provide some feedback.
</p>
<p>
The only catch is that this only works when the students actively push
changes up to GitHub. While this group of teachers have been great
that&#39;s sometimes a challenge with high school or college
students. Working on strategies to get this type of buy in from my
first years in the Fall.
</p>
<p>
So, GitHub Classroom&#39;s feedback mechanism? A big win and more great
work from the GitHub education team.
