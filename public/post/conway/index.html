We lost Mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">John Conway</a> to COVID-19 over the weekend. To
us non mathematicians Conway was most well known for his
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a> - a particularly interesting cellular automaton. If you
poke around the web you can find all sorts of neat things relating to
the Game of Life including a <a href="http://www.rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm">Turing Machine</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Some times, I&#39;d have classes explore the Game of Life and variants as
a whole unit though more often, I use it as a stepping stone to using
Cellular Automata to solve problems. I&#39;ve written about some of this.

I also saw this video over the weekend. It&#39;s a short interview from

I had the opportunity to meet Conway briefly  once about a decade ago. It was
an informal conversation at a puzzle conference. He was approachable
enough and nice enough but I didn&#39;t have a chance to really get into
anything in depth. Still, it was pretty cool to talk with him.
</p>
<p>
In the conversation he did mention &#34;that F*ing Game of Life,&#34; possibly
somewhat unhappy at it&#39;s being what he&#39;s so well known for  but to us
in the CS Teaching space it by itself was a gift worthy of a legacy.
