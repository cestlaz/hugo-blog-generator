I&#39;m writing this on my new <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro/">Pinebook Pro</a> - a $200 ARM based Linux
laptop. The Pinebook Pro comes from the <a href="https://www.pine64.org/">Pine64</a> project. As you could
figure out, they do the Pine64 which is similar to a Raspberry Pi and
they&#39;ve got some cool projects. In addition to the Pinebook pro
they&#39;ve also got the Pine Tab and Pine Phone and more. Now, you&#39;re not
going to be able to go to their site and say &#34;I need 30 of these for
my class&#34; - at least not for the Pinebook pro but it is a pretty cool
proof of concept and hobbyist machine and it shows that we could have
affordable devices for our schools and less afluent students. 
</p>
<p>
I got the PbP out of curiousity and also to see if I could find a low
cost solution for Hunter College students. All of my honors students
get laptops but the rest of Hunter CS is on their own so a low cost
device is pretty attractive.
</p>
<p>
The specs are pretty decent - 1080P 14&#34; screen, 4GB of memory, 64GB
mmc (upgradeable), USB-C, long battery life and more. They claim that
it can drive an external 4k monitor but I haven&#39;t tested this yet.
</p>
<p>
So, does it deliver?
</p>
<p>
Overall yes but with a few caveats. It&#39;s still on the side of a
tinkerer/hobbyist device.
</p>
<p>
Out of the box it seemed DOA - it wouldn&#39;t boot. I found in the forums
that there&#39;s an emmc enable switch inside that sometimes ended up in
the off position. I had to take out the eight screws from the bottom,
pop the case and flip the switch. Seems like that&#39;s something that
could have been caught before they closed the cases but it wasn&#39;t too
big of a deal. It is, however a deal breaker for a novice.
</p>
<p>
From there it booted fine. Right into Manjaro Linux running
KDE. Everything seemed to work. Next I tried to boot of an SD card -
Debian this time. Worked like a charm though the distribution kept
dropping WIFI.
</p>
<p>
Back to Manjaro. Being a Linuxmint user and having not used Manjaro in
about two years it took a bit of time to get the lay of the land but
just about everything worked. I installed syncthing which I use
instead of dropbox, zsh, and built Emacs from source. It took forever
but worked. Well, worked with some font problems. I ended up installing
Emacs 27 from the Manjaro repositories and everything went
seemelessly. Even though I ended up not using the source built Emacs
it did show that the G++ toolchain all worked well.
</p>
<p>
I also tested Java and Clojure. No problems though starting Clojure
seemed to take a day and a half. 
</p>
<p>
Other tests included installing the Cinnamon and Mate desktop
environments. The only thing I haven&#39;t been able to install
succesfully has been a VPN. On the battery front, I haven&#39;t used it
long enough in a sitting to put a dent in it.
</p>
<p>
Now, at $200, this isn&#39;t going to be a speed demon. My default config
does a bunch of things so even opening a terminal with zsh has some
lag. Once loaded though things are smooth. I would have loved more
memory but 4GB seems sufficient for day to day stuff and student work.
</p>
<p>
Will his become my day to day laptop? I don&#39;t know. I think if I can
slim down some of my config it might.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re looking for an innexpensive Linux laptop and are comfortable
tinkering and reading some forums check out the Pinebook. If it was an
option, I&#39;d love to get these for my students instead of the
overpriced Dells we have to get them every year.
