I&#39;m glad Mark wrote about this as it&#39;s something that&#39;s important to
both research and publicize but it&#39;s really not a surprise.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m going to start by dismissing the statement that &#34;… participation in
the Aspirations awards program were teh best predictors of persistence
three years after the high school survey in both CS and other
technology-related majors.&#34; To me, that&#39;s a water is wet statement -
girls who apply for an award where they talk about their aspiriations
in computing are more likely to do more computing. 
</p>
<p>
The other stuff merits more of a look. Classes and APCS-A in
particular vs after school programs. Since APCS-A is as far as I know
always an elective there&#39;s probably some selection bias here. If a
girl elects to take a college level CS class, perhaps there&#39;s already
some interest in pursuing CS in college. Further, and I really hate to
say this, given the male dominated aspects frequently present in our
CS classes, a girl who was interested in CS and survives APCS-A might
be more likely to continue on and succeed having weathered the storm. 
</p>
<p>
Now let&#39;s look at the out of school programs. There are a number of
issues here. Many don&#39;t really cover CS or legit programming, many
allow one group member to basically carry the team, and many are
really entrepreneurship programs using the CS marketing hype. They
don&#39;t really prepare students for what&#39;s to come in CS. When a
student then takes a CS class in college they&#39;re ill prepared and drop
the subject. I&#39;ve seen it happen. Unfortunately, many of those after
school programs are masters of marketing and fundraising. Some get big
money from the Googles of the world but they&#39;re never held accountable
for preparing kids to fail. Rather, they&#39;re lauded and praised as
saviors of education. 
</p>
<p>
Going further, after school programs are usually taught by volunteers,
not teachers. They don&#39;t necessarily understand the nuances of
teaching and they don&#39;t necessarily prepare you for your next CS
experience. You then end up in a college course of 300, are ill
prepared to succeed, fall through the cracks and drop out. Take APCS-A
in HS and you&#39;re going to be in a class of 30 and in a much more
supportive, forgiving  environment. A much better place to prepare you
for what&#39;s to come.
</p>
<p>
All in all the idea that girls are more likely to follow a CS path
with a solid high school experience than with an outside club or
activity is hardly a surprise. What is more of a surprise to me is the
fact that it&#39;s taken so long to start getting the word out.
