Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a
  program in the first place. So if you&#39;re as clever as you can be
  when you write it, how will you ever debug it? 
</p>
<p>
– Brian Kernighan
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</p>
<p>
Debugging is what the <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/csedpodcast/2020/01/07/episode-3-amy/#more-197">third episode</a> of the CS Ed Podcast was all
about. Kristin Stephens-Martinez of Duke University speaks with Amy Ko
of the University of Washington.
</p>
<p>
The long and the short  of it is that debugging is hard, teaching is
hard, and teaching debugging is hard.
</p>
<p>
Without even getting to the difficulties, one of the interesting
points discussed was that debugging is normally not the priority in CS
classes. Classes, lessons, and assignments are about learning to
program not how to debug programs. That makes debugging an add on and
an unpredictable one at that. Students will have to deal with bugs and
the time necessary not to mention the cognitive load isn&#39;t really
factored in.
</p>
<p>
This also got me thinking about designing debugging
experiences. That&#39;s also really hard. It&#39;s easy enough to insert
syntax errors but if students see them in an intelligent editor
they&#39;ll be clued in to their locations. On paper, it&#39;s trickier but
either are more cases of learning the syntax than debugging a
program. To debug I&#39;m thinking you really have to create a program or
part of a program with the intent for it to do something and have it
fail or do something else.
</p>
<p>
Teachers could also make code samples that don&#39;t work as a result of
logic errors but those are also hard. They can be too obvious -
remember students are explicitly looking to fix them not discovering
an unintended error in their own code or they can be so convoluted
that in reality someone faced with the code would just rewrite it.
</p>
<p>
So, what to do?
</p>
<p>
Amy mentions that she asks students to write down what the program
should do. If they don&#39;t understand what it should do it&#39;s even harder
to understand what it&#39;s doing wrong. When a student comes to me saying
&#34;my program doesn&#39;t work&#34; I&#39;ll frequently ask them what they want it
to do. We then segue to &#34;what did you tell the computer to do.&#34; I
frequently tell students that computers are really bad at doing what
you want them to do but really great at doing what you tell them to
do. This leads to a couple of techniques. One, described here in
another Brian Kernighan quote:
</p>
<p>
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Another effective [debugging] technique is to explain your code to
someone else. This will often cause you to explain the bug to
yourself. Sometimes it takes no more than a few sentences, followed by
an embarrassed &#34;Never mind, I see what&#39;s wrong. Sorry to bother you.&#34;
This works remarkably well; you can even use non-programmers as
listeners. One university computer center kept a teddy bear near the
help desk. Students with mysterious bugs were required to explain them
to the bear before they could speak to a human counselor.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</p>
<p>
This of course related directly to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duck debugging</a>. Also code
tracing works well at this point. Rubber Duck Debugging is interesting
because it&#39;s a example of convergent evolution having developed
independently in both industry and education. Code tracing is
interesting because it&#39;s used both to teach an understanding of
programming and also as a debugging technique.
</p>
<p>
Another point that came up is that as instructors we see the same
errors from each new crop of students. Now, what do we do about it? Is
it worth the students hitting that error wall and figuring out? Should
we scaffold or prepare them? How much? It&#39;s an interesting point to
ponder and there&#39;s no single right answer.
</p>
<p>
A final point from the podcast related to CS culture as Amy pointed
out: 
</p>
<p>
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 I Think it also interacts a lot with–going back to the culture of
 computing–computer science, especially in higher education, is a
 place where people like to signal their intelligence, right? It’s not
 a place where we say, “You know, I had a hard time with this. I
 worked really hard to get to this level of understanding.” It’s a
 place where people say, “I figured it out because I’m smart and I’m
 clever. Look at this clever thing I did.” Right?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</p>
<p>
Over my career I&#39;ve found this to be true and it&#39;s something of a
contradiction to the fail early and openly dictum we hear so often. I
ray of light though is that at least at the more introductory levels
there are efforts to change this culture.
</p>
<p>
So, if you haven&#39;t listened to episode 3 take the time to do so. It&#39;s
only about 25 minutes. 
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot more to talk about with debugging - using debuggers and
other tools, testing, code reviews and on and on but for now I&#39;ll
leave you with one last though on debugging with another Brian
Kernighan quote:
</p>
<p>
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
