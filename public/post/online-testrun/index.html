Hunter&#39;s classes are still on hiatus while we figure out how we&#39;re
going to deliver instruction remotely. I have it easier than
most. First, my students all get laptops as being part of the Daedalus
program. This doesn&#39;t mean they have great internet access or access
at all but it does mean they have a device that can run everything we
need them to run. I don&#39;t yet know if they all have adequate internet
access but I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s either not an issue or one that we can
easily figure out.
</p>
<p>
Next, software. Again, I&#39;m lucky. Zoom seems to be the best of breed
for synchronous stuff and as faculty in the school of education, I
have an account. The rest of the CS faculty don&#39;t. The rest of Hunter
has to use some combination of Blackboard based tools and freely
available stuff. 
</p>
<p>
Today, we tested everything out. I had about 10 students volunteer. We
did a Zoom meeting and tried all the feature: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
public and private chat
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
screen sharing
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
whiteboards
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
breakout rooms
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The breakout rooms were the big thing I wanted to check out. They&#39;re a
little clunky but overall pretty nice. It&#39;s a bit kludgey when someone
joins the conference after breakout rooms are formed but overall it
worked well.
</p>
<p>
For async stuff we&#39;ll mostly stick with the same tools - email, GitHub
and GitHub classroom but I think we&#39;ll also give Slack another go. My
problem with Slack is that it didn&#39;t seem to work well within the
students day. It may work for a professional in front of their screen
most of the day but students are in and out of class and other
obligations. They&#39;ll miss the real time flow and then have to navigate
through a muddy thread stream to catch up.
</p>
<p>
Now with everyone working from home Slack might be a better fit. We&#39;ll
see.
</p>
<p>
Thursday I go live. 
</p>
<p>
I think the lesson I&#39;m planning for my CS1 translates pretty easily to
online but might have to work my CS2 plans. In any event we&#39;ll see how
it goes.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure the rest of the semester will be challenging for all of us
but I also know it&#39;s okay if we fumble through and make mistakes. <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/focus-to-feel-normal/">It&#39;s
not all about the content</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Would love to hear from my fellow teachers how it&#39;s working with
them. Alfred Thompson has already been blogging about <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2020/03/teaching-from-homeday-1.html">his experiences</a>
with going remote so we&#39;re getting play by play from a rural private
(Catholic) high school. I&#39;ll add the NYC public college
experience.
</p>
<p>
If you want to share how it&#39;s going for you but don&#39;t blog, send it as
a long comment or do a guest post.
</p>
<p>
We&#39;ll all be more isolated physically over the next few weeks so let&#39;s
share more in the digital world.
