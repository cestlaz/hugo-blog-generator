It&#39;s almost time for CSTA2020. I&#39;m looking forward to it but since
it&#39;s going remote it is going to be interesting.
</p>
<p>
Since CSTA is, at least to me, very much a  &#34;people conference&#34; as
opposed to a &#34;session conference&#34; it&#39;ll be interesting to see how it
all plays out.
</p>
<p>
One of the things I was super excited about last year was Devorah&#39;s
getting her <a href="http://blanketstatementproject.com/">Blanket Statement</a> project off the ground. The whole idea
was to have knitters and crocheters make squares while attending
conference sessions instead of incessantly checking their
phones. Productive fidgeting she calls it. At the end, Devorah put the
squares together into a blanket and it was donated to a child in need.

It was really cool. Our friends at GitHub Education provided space at
their booth where Devorah could teach knitters or people could stop by
on a break to make a square or two.
</p>
<p>
It was really cool.
</p>
<p>
While we can&#39;t do it again in person we can do it remotely. So, if you
knit or crochet, pick up those needles or hooks while you&#39;re watching
those sessions and knit some squares. 
</p>
<p>
You can <del>email</del> mail  your squares to Devorah and she&#39;ll put them all together
into a blanket or you can donate them locally. 
</p>
<p>
You can find more details at <a href="http://blanketstatementproject.com">http://blanketstatementproject.com</a> or
email Devorah at <a href="http://mailto:blanketstatementproject@gmail.com">blanketstatementproject@gmail.com</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Hope to see many friends at CSTA2020 and hope many do some productive
fidgeting to crowdsource a blanket for a chile in need.
