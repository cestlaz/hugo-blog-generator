I&#39;m glad it&#39;s Saturday morning. It&#39;s been a busy week. It looks like
there&#39;s a couple more to plough through but hopefully then I can catch
my breath over spring break.
</p>
<p>
Why so busy? It&#39;s the same old story - you&#39;ve got all those projects
that you&#39;re waiting on and everything comes in at the same time.
</p>
<p>
To start off, it&#39;s college decision season. The high school seniors
all know their options and are deciding where to go. While we&#39;re still
considering some applications to my Daedalus honors CS program, most
of the offers have gone out or will go out within a couple of days.
</p>
<p>
I started the week with an info session about the program. eBay was
nice enough to host. I&#39;ve held this session there now for the past
three years. First time, I had about 20 attendees and am not sure if
it made a difference in any high school senior&#39;s decision. Last year
we had about 40 in the room but this year we reached capacity
at 65. Each senior was allowed to brign a +1. Some didn&#39;t, many
brought a parent but a few brought a friend. At the end of the
session, most of the friends sought me out and asked if it was too
late to apply. I told them where to fill everything out but
unfortunately I didn&#39;t know if I would be allowed to consider them or
not. 
</p>
<p>
I also had about 10 of my current students at the event. This was the
first time I was able to have that many. First time, I only had a
handful in the program and last year we first had to reschedule due to
weather and most of my students had class on the rain date. Having a
bunch of current students there to mix and talk with the applicants
was proabably the most important part of the evening. 
</p>
<p>
At the end, the high schoolers had left and the students and I were
BSing along with Paul, our host when Paul offered a tour and then went
into an impromptu tech talk with the kids. I really
wanted to get home to bed but the kids were loving it so I let it
ride.
</p>
<p>
All in all it was a great night for my current students and I&#39;m hoping
also for the high schoolers but it was a draining way to start the
week.
</p>
<p>
We also had a big CUNY2X event last week on Thursday evening. Around
50 students interviewing with fifteen or so companies for summer
internships. We&#39;ve had this event three semesters in a row now. It&#39;s a
long evening but at the end of the day lots of students get both
interviewing experience as well as offers. 
</p>
<p>
Things also started to move this past week on our CS Education
programs but not in a good way. Rather than approving our programs
they came back with a bunch of questions. It&#39;s rather frustrating
since we cover everything they want and then some but they don&#39;t seem
to be seeing it. For example, we&#39;ve got a big chunk of our topics
course where we&#39;ll essentially cover full stack development light and
we cover way in excess of anything in NY&#39;s forthcoming standards on
networks and systems not to mention things like cybersecurity,
accessibility, UX and more in that unit but the state said they don&#39;t see
any evidence to that effect. So I had too start to take our syllabi and bloat
them with excruciating detail. Something I&#39;ll be doing over the
weekend and into next week.
</p>
<p>
To add to the week I had to pack. I&#39;ve been pushing for an office move
for about two years. When I came to Hunter they placed me physically
in the Ed school. It made sense - I&#39;m officially appointed there but
I&#39;ve done most of my work so far with CS. Even when my CSED programs
start, many of the students will be grad students or working teachers
so they won&#39;t be on campus much except for when they teach. On the
other hand the CS undergrads are around all the time. Well, Monday I&#39;m
moving to a new office right by the all the CS action. 
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s also been a busy semester for my course planning. I&#39;m teaching
data structures at Hunter for the first time. I&#39;ve taught it many
times before but that was to a known audience with a different
toolset - Java instead of C++. To be honest, I&#39;m not particularly
happy with how I&#39;ve been doing. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been terrible but
I&#39;ve left plenty of classes feeling I&#39;ve missed my marks. I know
that it&#39;s something I&#39;ll have figured out and next time around I&#39;ll be
back up to speed but it&#39;s made planning and reflection more of a time
sink and it always bothers me when I don&#39;t feel my students are
getting my best.
</p>
<p>
So, it&#39;s been a busy week in a busy semester. For the most part, good
things happening but I&#39;m really looking forward to spring break.
