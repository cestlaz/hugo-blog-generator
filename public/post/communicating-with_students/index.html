Out of class student communication is always a challenge. There are
plenty of options:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Piazza
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Facebook group
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Slack, Discord, or other chat system
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Discourse, Vanilla or other discussion forum system
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Mailing list
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
but all have warts. 
</p>
<p>
I shared my thoughts on a number of these options <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/class-communications/">a while ago</a> but
thought I&#39;d update them now.
</p>
<p>
Most of my opinions hold form my earlier post. I was using and
continue to use a mailing list as I can be pretty sure that students
will get the email and they don&#39;t have to go to any outside site or
application. Now, getting them to respond or just use it for general
class communication is another story.
</p>
<p>
I also tried Slack again but it fared no better than my last attempt
with it. A couple of students used it but mostly, Slack was left to
die. I could have forced some engagement by posting assignments on
Slack but there wasn&#39;t any real upside. 
</p>
<p>
Earlier this semester some students said we should set up Discord -
&#34;all the students use it!&#34; was the line. Discord can be used as a chat
server similar to Slack but was created for gaming and also does voice
communication and other things. Personally, I prefer Slack. Funny
thing was that as I discussed this with my students I pointed out &#34;you
know, we have a Slack channel set up and you all already have accounts
on it.&#34; Most of them didn&#39;t even remember. 
</p>
<p>
So, we tried Discord and there was the usual burst of activity when we
first set it up but now it&#39;s again, mostly dormant. A few students who
use Discord for personal use are usually online but I&#39;d chalk it up as
another failure.
</p>
<p>
So, what am I going to try next? GitHub. 
</p>
<p>
GitHub doesn&#39;t provide a general chat or email solution but it does
have what they call &#34;issues.&#34;  I got the idea from <a href="https://twitter.com/ericdrosado">Eric Rosado</a> of
GitHub Education who clued me in on what issues can do.
</p>
<p>
When you create a GitHub repository - something I do for class web
pages as well as assignments, you can also open issues. Issues are
associated with the project but also act as a lightweight forum. You
can go to a page and see all the issues (topics) and each one can have
a chain of messages (thread). You can tag them, filter them, and when
you&#39;re done, close them (and reopen them later if needs be). The big
plusses are that:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
People who are subscribed to the repo (assignment, web page, etc.)
automatically get email alerts on the issues.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
You can explicitly tag people to force them to get alerts.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
You can directly reply via email so you don&#39;t need to go to
GitHub.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Everything related to a given project or repo is self contained.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If you&#39;re using GitHub / GitHub classroom you can use issues to
create a logged communication with your students on specific assignments.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I haven&#39;t used this class wide yet - just experimented a bit but I
plan to dive in much more deeply next semester.
</p>
<p>
This isn&#39;t an overall communication solution. I&#39;m sticking with a
mailing list for that until I can find a better solution but I think
using GitHub issues will be a win for project and assignment related
discussion.
