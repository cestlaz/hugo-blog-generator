Austin Cory Bart put together a great <a href="https://acbart.github.io//2020/06/10/race-in-cs1/">post</a> about supporting Black
students in CS1. Cory asked about this on the SIGCSE mailing list and
in his post he both breaks things down and shares all the resources
that he compiled from the ensuing discussion. 
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of good stuff both in the post and in the links but
there&#39;s a lot to get lost in. As teachers we can sometimes affect
change at a department or school level but we can always make a
difference in our classes and with our students.
</p>
<p>
I titled this post &#34;Supporting Our Students&#34; and not &#34;Supporting Black
Students.&#34; I&#39;m certainly <strong>not</strong> pulling any all lives matter BS but
rather reflecting back on something that shaped my approach with my
students and started to open my eyes and that specific experience for
me was an all students experience.
</p>
<p>
I cut my teach at Seward Park High School down on the Lower East
Side. It was a high poverty school and a very diverse one. I had
top flight honors students, criminal thugs, druggies, sweet kids whom
the system failed and everything else you can imagine. The main groups
were classified back then as Chinese and Hispanic and then Black then
White but within those groups there were subdivisions. Shortly before
I got the gig the school had brokered an in school truce between the
factions of Chinese gangs and while the term of the day was
Hispanic the students were from a variety of places.
</p>
<p>
One day I was talking to a guidance counselor in the hall. We didn&#39;t
know each other - I shanghaied her in another conversation - I had
something to ask. She said &#34;wait - you&#39;re Zamansky right?&#34; Yep. &#34;I was
wondering who you were, all the students want to be in your class.&#34; I
was confused. I wasn&#39;t super popular - I was just in about a year and
a half. I also wasn&#39;t so good. I&#39;d rate myself as an above average
very raw young teacher but that&#39;s about it. She explained that I was
one of the only teachers where students from all the population groups
wanted to be in my class. The Hispanic students, for instance all
wanted to be in Pablo Chang&#39;s math class, the Chinese in another
teachers but apparently I appealed to everyone equally. 
</p>
<p>
I started to think about why that might be the case and it got me
thinking about what I had learned in my short time teaching. Prior to
teaching I led a pretty sheltered life. I went to public school up
until college and had a pretty diverse group of friends but as a kid
you can be pretty oblivious to economic and race related
differences. As an adult I went to a private college, NYU, and started off
at Goldman Sachs. Not exactly a recipe for awareness. I quickly
realized that not all kids learned the same, thought the same and
going further, lived the same.
</p>
<p>
It taught me that it&#39;s not merely about talking to your students, it&#39;s
about listening to them. Given time and the chance, they&#39;ll open up
and you&#39;ll learn about their challenges. When it seems there giving
you a song and dance, don&#39;t assume they&#39;re trying to pull a fast
one. Give them the benefit of the doubt. You&#39;ll get burned now and
again by a kid taking advantage but things have a way of coming clean
and if you don&#39;t give the kid the benefit of the doubt you can
irreparably harm your relationship. Trust is key in
education.  Besides I&#39;ve been burned way more by giving the benefit of
the doubt to people professionally than as a teacher and at the end of
the day I&#39;d rather lose sleep angry over being taken advantage of than
lose sleep feeling guilty for damaging my relationship with a student
for the wrong reasons.
</p>
<p>
If you treat your students like people - young people but  people
nonetheless and earnestly listen and try to learn from them and learn
about them that&#39;s your guide. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m particularly good at
helping my kids - I&#39;m your stereotypical socially awkward computer
geek but the more I listened the more I understood the individual
issues my students had to deal with. My Black students, my immigrant
students, my poor students and all the rest. Sure there were common
themes but every one has a unique story.
</p>
<p>
While we teach our assorted subjects to our students really at the end
of the day more so than teaching any specific computer science I hope
to be a force for good in their lives and their development as
people. The best way I can do that is to listen, try to learn, try to
understand and then try to help and support.
