Or, as Wayne Gretzky said &#34;You miss 100% of the shots you don&#39;t take.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Why do I mention this? 
</p>
<p>
Because I&#39;ve been hearing way too often from young people who are too
quick to deny themselves opportunities and too often these are
from students who have come from less advantaged backgrounds.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s Fall and I&#39;ve been making my rounds visiting local schools to
talk to seniors about colleges in general and Hunter CS in
particular. I end the talk going over my Daedalus program which is
Hunter&#39;s honors CS scholarship program.
</p>
<p>
Since starting my &#34;Fall tour&#34; I&#39;ve hard from too many students both in
person and via email saying things like &#34;I don&#39;t think I have the grades for,&#34; &#34;I&#39;ll
never make it in,&#34; &#34;It&#39;s a waste of time for me to apply.&#34; They might
be talking about my program or they might be talking about some other
college. Sometimes the students would indeed have less than a punchers
chance to get in to the program in question but other times their
academic profile would certainly get their foot in the door. In all
cases it made me sad that these students were denying themselves
possible opportunities. 
</p>
<p>
As I talk to these students I share instances where people who have
not met the required &#34;paper profile&#34; had indeed made the cut. I make
sure to be honest with them - I don&#39;t sell them a bill of goods. They
chances of acceptance might be small but in the greater scheme of
things the cost of an application is insignificant compared to the benefit
of possibly getting into the program you really want (or at least
think you want).
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen similar self doubt behaviour from college kids and young
adults. Some don&#39;t apply for jobs because they dont&#39; have every single
skill listed on a job requirements page or the company is too
lofty. Here I try to explain how these listings get made - how an HR
person adds every single possible skill. I don&#39;t advocate lying on a
resume or job application but if they&#39;ve got the core skills or domain
skills required for the job but not everything, apply - let the
company say no.
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned at the top, too often I&#39;ve been hearing things like
these from less advantaged kids. Kids that start with less and have to
fight for more.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s hard enough for young people on their journeys through life. I
wish they wouldn&#39;t make it harder by denying themselves potential
opportunities by not applying.
