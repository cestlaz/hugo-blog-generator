I&#39;ve been meaning to do my version of the Emacs VI rant for a while. A
few years ago I staged out a video showing what it would be like for a
beginner to start with Emacs, Vim, Atom, and Sublime Text but decided
it would be long, unwieldy and clunky to present - particularly when
it came to customization. 
</p>
<p>
I tabled it for a while but recently have been seeing a bunch of
threads, videos and posts talking about Emacs and Vim. Some are really
well done, balanced and sensible like Derek Taylor&#39;s over on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaBdlcYaZLQ">DistroTube</a>. On the other hand, I saw plenty of what makes me
nuts. People claiming things like style is objectively better than
the other or was created with speed or ergonomics in mind so is
superior and the like.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s my take. I think it&#39;s a little different than some of the other
rants because I look a bit at history and evolution and also at the
day to day reality of editing. Hope you enjoy it.
