A question that frequently comes up with respect to CS for All is what
does it mean? 
</p>
<p>
To me it means giving all students some fundamental exposure to
computer science so that they can:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Make use of those thinking skills, problem solving approaches, and
practical tools regardless of their future paths. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Provide a path for the subset of &#34;all&#34; that desire to further pursue
computer science.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
But even with this, how do you do it?
</p>
<p>
Does it mean that you require computer science? If so, do we require it every
year? some years? One time only?
</p>
<p>
Does it mean you offer it as an elective? If so, when?
</p>
<p>
I think about this a fair amount but decided to write something up
when I saw this tweet:
</p>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">STEM related career interests are largely developed before high school (Sadler, Sonnert, Hazari, &amp; Tai, 2012) <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/csforall?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#csforall</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/csedweek?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#csedweek</a> <a href="https://t.co/TiAUvpP3bQ">https://t.co/TiAUvpP3bQ</a></p>&mdash; Lana Peterson (@tyLanasaurusrex) <a href="https://twitter.com/tyLanasaurusrex/status/1070475730562084864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>
I responded that I&#39;ve seen many kids get their first exposure in high
school and from that go on to careers in tech so it&#39;s clear to me that
high school isn&#39;t too late. I was reminded that I was talking about
kids who went through my required HS CS class so the kids had no
choice but to be exposed to CS but the people advocating starting at
an elementary level are talking about a compulsory experience so to
compare a required elementary experience against an elective high
school one is really apples to oranges.
</p>
<p>
Even thought it&#39;s an unfair comparison there are a lot of things it
can lead one to consider.
</p>
<p>
Should we teach CS in every grade? Probably not. How about every band?
Maybe. For those of you not living in the K12 world &#34;by band&#34; usually
refers to a set of grades - kindergarten to 2, 3 through 5, 6-8, and
then high school. Where should it be required and where an elective?
</p>
<p>
Teaching a required CS class in every grade or band is going to be a
huge undertaking. I&#39;m also not sure it&#39;s required. To get the best
bang for your buck you want to expose the kids to CS in a way and at a
time when they might pursue it further. If you&#39;re having only one
required experience, I don&#39;t think the elementary grades are the
place.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s that point in time, I think around first through third grade
where dinosaurs are all the rage. Maybe more so in NYC where we have
access to the <a href="https://www.amnh.org/">American Museum of Natural History</a> but still. Lots of
young kids want to be paleontologists but it doesn&#39;t hold. Okay. maybe
I&#39;m being a little silly here but I think the basic point is
accurate. Kids are exposed to many things in the early grades that
just fade away. 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not saying that we shouldn&#39;t do CS or CS related things in grade
school. Things like the activity <a href="https://twitter.com/fredwilson">Fred Wilson</a> described in his post on
this year&#39;s <a href="https://avc.com/2018/12/la-hora-del-codigo/">Hour of Code</a> or the problem solving and logic games good
teachers do if given the time and resources. Things that have
always been done by some teachers in some schools but are now being
relabled CS or Computational Thinking. These are great practices and
should be made available to all students as part of their elementary
education but I doubt that they&#39;ll lead to many kids following CS as a
career path. I&#39;m not an elementary school expert but to me, even
though I see great value in the early logic / problem solving stuff, I
don&#39;t see hyping CS early as making a difference unless there&#39;s some
follow up before the interest fades.
</p>
<p>
That brings us to the middle school bands. I&#39;ve dabbled a little here
but it&#39;s also not my wheelhouse. In my experience, kids in lower
middle school can dabble in DnD tools and start to develop some 
coding skills and explore some of the CS concepts that they&#39;ll see in
late HS or college and those in upper middle school can play with the
text based languages to do the same. What I also noticed is that what
can be accomplished in a month with those kids in middle school can be
done in a week or two when the kids are a year or two older and with
greater understanding and retention. 
</p>
<p>
As a side note, before people get up in arms with &#34;I teach middle
school kids APCS-A and they all master it&#34; let me say that I&#39;m
describing my experience across a range of middle school kids. There
will always be few outliers who can do more when younger. That said
I&#39;m betting that most people who say that any middle school kid can
indeed master APCS-A hasn&#39;t done so in an inner city poor public
school. Have you done it while teaching a class of 34?  With a class
of low income students with all the disadvantages and challenges
inherent to that population? What&#39;s more did you then have to teach
them a data structures course a year or two later to see if they
really mastered the original material.
</p>
<p>
This brings us to high school. As with my original tweet, in my
experience if you give kids a good first CS experience in high school
you can indeed give them everything needed for CS for All and it&#39;s
close enough to college so that they might very well continue on the
CS career path.
</p>
<p>
So where does this leave us? We certainly should embed computational
thinking practices (whatever that actaully means) in the elementary
school, particularly if we can do it in a way that also supports other
academic areas and while it&#39;s nice to have a CS middle school
experience and if we can afford to offer one that&#39;s wonderful. On the
other hand, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as important as elementary exposure and
high school exposure so if we have to cut a corner, that&#39;s the
place. To me, and of course I&#39;m biased, the critical time for a
requirement is high school. Sure, if it&#39;s an elective kids won&#39;t take
it but that&#39;s true of a lot of subjects. I don&#39;t know what the
research says but people do indeed change directions. How many of us
are doing what we thought we&#39;d be doing in grade school or middle
school. Heck, even high school. I have a friend that did computer work
in his twenties and thirties, then went to law school and practiced
law for a bunch of years and then in his forties started a production
company in LA. 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a big believer in CS for All but to me it doesn&#39;t mean it has to
be in every grade or every band. If I could only do it in one place it
would be required in the high school. If in two I&#39;d add the elementary
school piece and then finally the middle school.
</p>
<p>
As a final point I&#39;d like to add that school is a zero sum game. There
are only so many minutes in the day and as we add CS we remove
something else. I believe we can add CS or, more specifically CT to
the elemntary schools without cutting anything and I know there&#39;s room
in high schools in NY. I&#39;m not sure about middle schools. In any
event, I&#39;d hate to see music and art programs - already decimated by
budget cuts and misguided policies like the small schools movement
take a further hit so as to get CS everywhere.
</p>
<p>
Just some food for thought.
