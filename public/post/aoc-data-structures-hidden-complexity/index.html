Since 2015, <a href="https://twitter.com/ericwastl">Eric Wastl</a> has gifted us each December with <a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of
Code</a> - a 25 day programming competition that I very much enjoy. This
year I haven&#39;t been able to get to too many of the problems. I only
completed the first two days on the day they were released, problem
three a day late and then I didn&#39;t get back to the problems until
almost 12/25 - the final day of the competition. I&#39;ve spent a bit of
time over the break working through the problems. I&#39;m currently
through 9. I started working through the problems in Clojure - part of
my yearly attempt to dive into the language but then did a few in
Python just to speed up my progress.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, I did <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/9">question 9</a> which I found interesting as a teacher -
so much so that I think I&#39;ll assign at some point in the future.
At the core of the problem you have to maintain a list of items
inserting and deleting items at assorted locations. I threw together
this solution:

It worked and I got my first star. This unlocked part 2 which changed
the number of marbles in the game from 70950 to 70950&lt;b&gt;00&lt;/b&gt;. This
brings me to my first observation - hidden complexity. Seeing my input
I knew my part 2 would be crazy slow. The solution requires you insert
and delete into a list over and over again and I did it using a Python
list and a Python list is backed by an array. This means that every
insert and delete will be linear and I had a whole bunch of them.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s another great simple example of hidden complexity. Students and
beginners use Python lists as if they were linked structures with
direct indexing - the best of all worlds. It&#39;s great if you&#39;re dealing
with small data sets but unless you&#39;re careful things can get very
slow very fast. It&#39;s important that students learn about this and it
appears that many don&#39;t. 
</p>
<p>
Even though I knew the program would take forever to run it was my bed
time so I started it on part two and turned in for the night.
</p>
<p>
When I woke up I had an answer to part 2, entered it and earned my
next star. 
</p>
<p>
Of course I knew that the solution should really be written using a
doubly linked list. The funny thing is that if you&#39;re comfortable with
creating dynamic data structures like linked lists, writing a solution
using a doubly linked list and running it on part 2 actually takes a fraction of
the time of writing the original solution and running it. To make
sure, I did it. I decided to code it up in Java since I might assign
something like this to my students in C++. You can check it out <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/advent2018/tree/master/java">here</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The second take away was that it&#39;s actually beneficial for students to
be able comfortable with pointers and dynamic memory and while
creating a linked list let alone a tree can be tricky at first, <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/it-gets-easier-advent19/">it
does get easier.</a>
</p>
<p>
With all the debate going on over coding vs computational thinking vs
CS it&#39;s things like this - thinking about things like this that marks
one of the ways a computer scientist is different from a programmer.
