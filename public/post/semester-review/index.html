Now that the semester&#39;s over I&#39;ve had a chance to reflect a bit on my
teaching over the past year. 
</p>
<p>
This year I taught two classes each semester so the load was a little
higher. First semester was one class of our CS0 and one of the
lab/enrichment component that goes with CS1. Nothing big to report
there as I&#39;ve done them both before.
</p>
<p>
The biggest difference was that I had to deal with two separate
classes even though they&#39;re one cohort. I can&#39;t say I did a
particularly good job with that - something to keep working on next
year.
</p>
<p>
In the second semester the CS0 became the CS1 lab/enrichment and that
went pretty well overall. I was unhappy with some of the scheduling.
The students work on labs in class for a number of sessions and due to
circumstances beyond my control I had to finish out the class with a
number of consecutive lab classes whereas I would have much rather
spread those out with the enrichment lessons. Not happy about it but
there wasn&#39;t much I could do.
</p>
<p>
The other class was data structures. This was the first time I was
teaching it at Hunter, first time in C++ in well over a decade and
first time in around five years. I think the class went alright but
there was a lot of room for improvement. For one thing, C++ is not
Java. In Java things are pretty restricted - there&#39;s pretty much one
way to deal with linked list and dynamic structures. C++ is a little
more complex. Do you do structs or classes? When do you introduce
smart pointers (if at all)? Separate compilation and if so when? What
about templates/generics - they&#39;re much more cumbersome and complex in
C++. Also, don&#39;t get me started on exceptions. Lots of decisions to be
made and once you make them it&#39;s hard to change directions.
</p>
<p>
I decided to go with all classes, separate compilation, did
templates/generics early but then constrained our data structures to a
fixed type. Did regular pointers and then smart pointers a ways in.
</p>
<p>
Because of all of the changes, I also missed the chance to use a
number of my class motivations and tricks that I&#39;ve used in the
past. I should be able to mix those in next time around. Things like
building  a linked list or studetns in class prior to studying them or
playing out a mergesort with a deck of cards.
</p>
<p>
Another thing I had to deal with that was new was the range of student
backgrounds. I have a number of students in my program from NYCS&#39;s
specialized schools and Stuy in particular. No surprise but the Stuy
students have much more experience than the rest both in terms of time
they&#39;ve spent programming and in terms of what they&#39;ve studied. All of
the Stuy students had done most if not all of the data structures in
Java and most had taken 3 years of CS and have completed many major
projects. There were other students who did APCS-A plus another year but
not the data structures and finally those who had just done
APCS-A. They&#39;re all great kids and more experience doesn&#39;t equate to
more ability but there&#39;s a big difference in terms of what you can do
and how quickly you can do it after a year of APCS-A and a course or
three beyond it.
</p>
<p>
That was a tricky juggling and balancing act adn I think I&#39;ll handle
it better next year.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t get to cover quite as much as I wanted in the Data Structures
class and I certainly didn&#39;t cover it as well as I would have liked
but I don&#39;t think I did a bad job. I&#39;ve been in this racket long
enough to know the ebbs and flows.
</p>
<p>
Overall I was happy with the year teaching wise but see a lot of
places where I want to do better and do more.
