Last semester I wrote about how I was introducing my students to <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/code-review/">code
review</a>. I thought it worked pretty well and was anxious to try it
again.
</p>
<p>
Well, I did the lesson(s) again this past week and it looks like it&#39;s
a keeper. The setup was pretty much the same with some hiccups due to
using a new platform. Last semester I used plain GitHub public
repos. This time, I&#39;ve been using GitHub classroom which I like very
much but I forgot that I made this assignment use private repos which
turned out to be a hassle.
</p>
<p>
If you didn&#39;t read the previous post the short version was:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
group the kids in two&#39;s
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Each does a written (no talking) code review on the others previous
lab. Very little guidance was given as to what the review should
look like.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
We then did two parings where one person talked through a live code
review with the other.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Finally, we did one more written session. 
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
This left person with three reviews. 
</p>
<p>
This took the whole class since we had to finish some other material
before starting the reviews.
</p>
<p>
During the next class we discussed the review, what was important,
what wasn&#39;t etc. We also talked about coding standards and things like
<a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines">The C++ Core Guidelines</a> and Google&#39;s <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html">C++ Style Guide</a>.
</p>
<p>
As a follow up assignment, they&#39;re going to add a feature to another
student&#39;s solution to the lab they reviewed.
</p>
<p>
It seems that the class was effective when I taught it last
semester. I&#39;ve come to that conclusion because I&#39;m teaching that group
again in their Data Structures class and they seem to do better with
Pair Programming (which I related to a live, real-time code review)
and it does seem that they&#39;re paying at least a bit more attention to
the issues we highlighted in the code review lesson. 
</p>
<p>
I won&#39;t get the same chance to follow up with this group but I can at
least see in the next few weeks if it had any positive affect. One of
the things I&#39;m curious about has to do with the student&#39;s backgrounds.
Last semester&#39;s students all had a year of APCS-A under their belts
before coming to Hunter. This semester&#39;s students had a range from
APCS-P to a summer or after school program to nothing and their last
semester class with me was in my opinion a much lighter programming
class than a year of APCS-A. I&#39;m wondering if the current crop, having
written fewer large programs will have a different appreciation for
the topics we discussed during the code reviews. 
</p>
<p>
All of this got me to thinking about some of the things I saw both at
SIGCSE and on some of the posts that followed. Specifically about
teacher vs researchers and also, although not mentioned, K12 teachers,
teachers at the college level and researchers.
</p>
<p>
I was thinking about the fact that this is one of the ways I work to
improve at my craft. I try something, evaluate and reflect on the
results, then repeat, tweak etc. Not everything I try is a winner but
overall I think I&#39;ve made a pretty steady progression as a
teacher. 
</p>
<p>
I was also thinking that had I done this while in High School I would
have taught the lessons two to five times to similar but different
groups of students within a short period of days. I would also have
been able to iterate, possibly with variations, each semester. It
might not be instant but that&#39;s a lot of potential feedback. At
college, I&#39;m only teaching one section of each class and I&#39;m guessing
that most full time faculty members might only teach two of a
particular class (although I could be very wrong - I just based this
on looking up a few schedules). I also don&#39;t see my kids every
day. This makes for a slower, less effective feedback loop. On the
other hand, I&#39;m not running pillar to post every day so can actually
take the time to evaluate what&#39;s been happening in each class in
arguably a more meaningful way.
</p>
<p>
All of this is to say that most teachers I know trust other teacher&#39;s
experiences rather than &#34;the research&#34; and that was also what was born
out in this University of Colorado <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3287420">survey</a>. While there are plenty of
bad teachers who know that &#34;it&#39;s always been done this way and it&#39;s
worked well enough&#34; I&#39;ll always consider my most trusted education
resource to be a thoughtful, reflective, experienced teacher who
actively works on improving at their craft.  
</p>
<p>
This is not to say that there isn&#39;t merit in research. I saw
presentations at SIGCSE and on the one had said to myself &#34;ok, so he
discovered something that any moderately experienced K12 teacher
already knows&#34; and at the same time thinking &#34;but it&#39;s great that
they&#39;re now formalizing and documenting it.&#34; There are also things
that can be researched that a single classroom teacher just can&#39;t
approach and finally, to paraphrase a line from Mark Guzdial&#39;s talk
where he specifically addressed other CS Ed researchers - we can build
things and they need things built - a teacher / researcher partnership
can open a lot of yet unexplored doors for educators.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s all a reminder that we&#39;re all playing different
roles. Researchers aren&#39;t teachers, college teachers aren&#39;t K12
teachers, K12 teachers subdivide further and of course the same holds
for the reverse direction. Sure there are similarities in our goals
and our roles but there are some important differences.
</p>
<p>
With that in mind, I&#39;ll leave this with a quote form one of the all
time great screwball comedies:
