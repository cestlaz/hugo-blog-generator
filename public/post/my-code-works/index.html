One of my pet annoyances is how code ecosystems have gotten more and
more complex. Sometimes I think tool designers put together build
systems to show how clever they are rather than to solve dependency
problems as cleanly and simply as possible.
</p>
<p>
Over the break I wrote <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/github-org-explorer/">GitHub Org Explorer</a> - a tool to help deal with
GitHub classroom repositories. It worked but was using &#34;basic&#34;
authentication where it sent a username and password with every
request. As GitHub was deprecating that from their API I started to
look at converting the application to use oauth. 
</p>
<p>
First I threw together a little <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/clojurescript-electron-oauth-test">proof of concept app</a> that just
authenticated with GitHub and then started to move that code into my
explorer app.
</p>
<p>
First problem – the code that that worked in the proof of concept was
crashing out in my actual app. I ultimately did a line by line
analysis and couldn&#39;t find a difference. Even the configuration files
appeared the same. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, in a fit of desperation, I killed all the supporting
libraries that the build system installed and downloaded them again. 
</p>
<p>
It worked!!!!!
</p>
<p>
It didn&#39;t inspire much confidence though.
</p>
<p>
So, I went on and finished converting the app to oauth. All done,
right? Wrong.
</p>
<p>
I tried to build everything on another system and it crashed
out. Weird. It worked on one machine but not another. 
</p>
<p>
Solved that problem by wiping out the entire build system - node and
npm using nvm and shadow-cljs and it worked.
</p>
<p>
But it didn&#39;t. 
</p>
<p>
There was one final hurdle. 
</p>
<p>
When I used the build system to compile and run in &#34;development&#34; mode
everything worked. Compile for production? Not so much.
</p>
<p>
What could it be?
</p>
<p>
After about a day of fretting, I discovered  that for some reason,
when compiling for dev you get certain libraries including a string
formatting one I was using. When compiling for production you didn&#39;t
get them. Why would anyone set up a build system that way???????
</p>
<p>
Given that I&#39;m using a bunch of tools that I&#39;m new to - using
shadow-cljs to go from clojurescript to javascript all ending up with
a build for the electron platform - I just stopped using the library 
</p>
<p>
Problem solved. 
</p>
<p>
Well, sort of. 
</p>
<p>
I can now run my app but I&#39;m still not filled with confidence.
</p>
<p>
Now, I&#39;ve been at this game for a very long time. I&#39;ve been
programming for around 40 years. Imagine what it&#39;s like for student or
beginner.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve seen a post on the learn
programming subreddit from some beginner who learned using an online
tool or in a class that had them develop in a sandbox and they left
with no clue how to write a real program outside of the classroom
environment. If they&#39;re not prepared to merely write a program outside
of some courseware system they&#39;ll have little chance going up against
webpack, lienengen, cmake and the like.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not saying that we should throw our beginners out into the wild
and start them with vi, C, and autotools but nobody&#39;s paying attention
to the whole journey from Hello World to the real world.
</p>
<p>
Somebody should.
