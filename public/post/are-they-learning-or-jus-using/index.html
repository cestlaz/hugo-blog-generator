I recently took a look at the <a href="https://cryptopals.com/">Cryptopals Crypto Challenges</a>. It&#39;s a
series of challenges through which you can learn all about crypto and
crypto attacks. They say they&#39;ll eventually have solutions but since
the site appears to be at least a few years old, who knows it they&#39;ll
ever publish them.
</p>
<p>
One interesting thing about the site is that it really doesn&#39;t have a
lot of content to teach you the concepts around the challenges. At
least not for the first few, the only ones I&#39;ve looked at. You get a
bit of sample input, the sample output, a short description and then
you&#39;re off to the races.
</p>
<p>
This means that you&#39;re going to do some web searching to figure out
what the terms they use mean and how to approach the problems.
</p>
<p>
The first challenge was to convert a string of hex digits into
base64.  I&#39;d never done this so I figured I should look up what base64
was. I figured it was some encoding but exactly what was it?
</p>
<p>
A quick search yielded a bunch of online encoder/decoders and also the
Wikipedia page: &#34;…Base64 is a <strong>group</strong> of binary-to-text encoding
schemes…&#34; - a <strong>group</strong>? Uh oh. Which scheme am I to use? It turned
out that I was able to use the conversion table on the Wikipedia page
but I digress.
</p>
<p>
I decided to write the solution in Clojure and was about to do so but
decided to see if there was an idiomatic way to do this. I did a
search. Most if not all of the searches resulted in links either to a
Clojure library to encode and decode Base64 or example code that used
said library. 
</p>
<p>
If I wanted to I could code up a complete solution and not really
learn anything about base64 encoding. I&#39;m not talking about wholesale
copying a solution off of StackOverflow. I&#39;m talking about using the
included Clojure (technically Java) Base64 conversion library. 
</p>
<p>
This made me think about what I&#39;m seeing some times in CS Ed and lots
of time in drop in / opt in programs. 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d hear about classes where students are doing unbelievable
things. The kids made a neural network to do blah blah blah. I&#39;d think
to myself &#34;that&#39;s upper level undergraduate work, how can they really
understand all the math and CS to build that stuff when they&#39;re just
taking Algebra and their first CS class?&#34;
</p>
<p>
It turns out, they weren&#39;t. They&#39;d basically glue together libraries
and use pre-existing tools. 
</p>
<p>
This raises the question: &#34;is this a good thing?&#34;
</p>
<p>
Maybe and maybe not.
</p>
<p>
If those kids mentioned above aren&#39;t really studying AI but rather
intro programming and they&#39;re using AI as part of the motivation, it
can be terrific. It could inspire them to study AI later and that&#39;s
great.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, if they think they&#39;re really learning AI, that&#39;s not so good.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve met kids who were in either classes or programs on
cybersecurity. They were every confident in their knowledge and skills
but it turned out that they didn&#39;t really learn anything in their
classes. It was just a curated canned experience. In these cases the
programs and classes weren&#39;t really helping the kids. I&#39;ve met
teachers who&#39;ve told me about classes like these where the kids ended
up getting jobs but then promptly got fired because they didn&#39;t really
know anything more than a superficial view of the subject.
</p>
<p>
In this day and age students can&#39;t write everything from scratch but
I&#39;ve always believed that they should have some idea as to what&#39;s
going on under the hood. A friend would always say &#34;never use a tool
that you couldn&#39;t&#39; write yourself&#34; I concur. He didn&#39;t mean you have
to write every line yourself but you should have a basic idea as to
the underpinnings. 
</p>
<p>
There are cool and interesting things at all levels of CS and CS
education. I know we live in a day and age where teachers brag about
how early they can cover some advanced topic with their kids but it&#39;s
not a race. Let&#39;s teach the kids what they need when they need
it. They don&#39;t need to think they can write a deep learning platform
in year one. Right now I&#39;m teaching college first year students. We
don&#39;t cover the same things these kids will study in their 400 level
electives. I&#39;m fine with that. I cover some topics that allude to
what&#39;s to come and I set the stage for their futures.  Let&#39;s design
and implement CS experiences that make sense for our kids rather than
giving them false experiences so that we can say that they&#39;re doing
graduate level work in third grade.
