It took a while but we&#39;re finally here. Hunter College is launching
it&#39;s <a href="https://education.hunter.cuny.edu/admissions/graduate-programs/computer-science/">Computer Science Teacher Certification</a> programs. This was the
second big initiative I&#39;ve been working on at Hunter. The first was
the Daedalus undergraduate CS scholars program. The Daedalus program
started my first year and is now providing the best value (and in my
opinion best) undergraduate CS opportunity in New York. 
</p>
<p>
CS Certification took longer. I had to design the programs, they had to
make it through the whole CUNY governance process which even under
ideal circumstances takes around a year and then up through NYSED. Oh,
and we had to convince the state to create a certification area in the
meantime.
</p>
<p>
In any event, we&#39;re live and will kick off our certificate program
this summer. That&#39;s the program designed for teachers already
certified in another subject area seeking to add the CS credential.
</p>
<p>
So, what does the program look like? 
</p>
<p>
It combines content and pedagogy. It was designed to give teachers the
CS they need and the knowledge of how to teach it. 
</p>
<p>
In terms of content, you need some depth. In my opinion, that depth
should be at least a class beyond what you&#39;d normally expect to
teach. For example a math teacher&#39;s classes would max out with BC Calc
so I&#39;d want a math teacher to have a math class beuond that. Since we
max out with APCS-A, my program takes teachers through data
structures - APCS-AB or CS2. 
</p>
<p>
Teachers also need breadth. They don&#39;t need to have a full course in
AI or a full class in Graphics etc. but a course that gives them
exposure to a number of fields. Enough to teach a unit, mentor a
precocious student, or learn more on their own to develop new
courses. We have a topics course for that.
</p>
<p>
To round out the CS part of the program we have a programming heavy
ethics course. While ethics are woven throughout all the courses - CS
and CS Ed we felt that this standalone course also adds great value to
our program.
</p>
<p>
This is a far cry from what I&#39;ve seen in many other CS Ed programs
which follow the &#34;you take it you teach it&#34; philosophy. Basically
teachers take Exploring CS, APCS-P, and APCS-A and viola, you&#39;ve got
CS teachers. Not in my book.
</p>
<p>
Then we mix in the CS Ed. Two methods course where we introduce
additional content and how to teach it and also a curriculum design
course. The methods courses are based on current best practices and on
what I&#39;ve learned helping teachers develop over the years but I&#39;m
particularly excited about the curriculum design course. Over the
years I had to take three curriculum design courses and didn&#39;t learn a
thing about curriculum design in any of them. I swore that if I ever
created an education course it would be a curriculum design course
that was good. Over the years, I
developed units, classes and full programs and learned a few
tricks. That in turn developed into the course. Teachers will study
existing curricula and develop their own and since the course
integrates fieldwork, they&#39;ll deliver it as well.
</p>
<p>
While I had internal help at Hunter, I want to send a special thanks
to JonAlf, Sam, and Topher - three of the best teachers I know who
provided feedback, assistance, and inspiration (sometimes without
knowing it) along with other friends in education, academia, and
industry throughout New York State who made sure I designed a program
that would work for teachers across New York State.
