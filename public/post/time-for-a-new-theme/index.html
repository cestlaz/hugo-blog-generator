            <p>
While setting up my <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pinebook-update/">Pinebook Pro</a> I wanted to make sure I could write
blog posts. <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> installed and ran no problem but I switched to
Hugo in April 2020 back when it was version .49 or something like
that. Now it&#39;s up to .73. It turns out there have been a few
changes. First, I set up my blog with two directories for posts. One
for the posts I wrote originally in Jekyll and one for the ones I
wrote for Hugo. I had to make a few changes to get that to work with
the new version.
</p>
<p>
I also discovered that my archive page no longer works under the
current version of Hugo. As I poked around a little more, it turns out
that HTML embedding changed so I&#39;m going to have to tweak all my Emacs
posts as well as posts where I embed tweets or other content.
</p>
<p>
All of this is to say that some or maybe many of my older posts will
be wonky until I can get around to fixing them. 
</p>
<p>
Rather than figuring out how to fix them under my current blog theme I
figured it was also a good time to explore a new Hugo theme so don&#39;t
be surprised if the overall look here changes a few times over the
next few posts.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to get everything working again sooner rather
than later.
