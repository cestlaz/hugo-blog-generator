            <p>
The state got back to us the other week on our CSEd programs. Still no
approval. 
</p>
<p>
One of the requirements is that we have 12 graduate CS
credits in our program and that in those courses these five major
areas:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Algorithms and programming
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Computing systems
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Data and analysis
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Impacts of computing
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Networks and the internet
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
as described in the <a href="https://k12cs.org/">K12 CS Framework</a>. Even though many of the items
described in the framework fit better in an education side course NY
is requiring that it&#39;s all covered in CS courses offered by a CS
department.  The state has more information <a href="http://www.nysed.gov/college-university-evaluation/computer-science-certificate-coursework-guidance">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
To be honest, I&#39;m not a fan of the K12 Framework and others have also
voiced their concerns about it. Ultimately I think many states will
use it as a certification guide and it will open the door to
substandard preservice programs that will certify teachers lacking in
CS content knowledge.
</p>
<p>
Still, the programs we designed at Hunter more than covered all the
required bases. 
</p>
<p>
So, why did the state come back asking for clarification? Because not
everything was explicit in our sample syllabi. As we all know, Syllabi
are usually rather terse documents with just a couple of lines per
topic, maybe also an assignment and some readings. If they contained
all the richness of all the lessons they&#39;d be volumes rather than the
usual page or two. So, to provide the requested clarifications I&#39;ve been spending
the weekend breaking them out to show more detail.
</p>
<p>
This got me thinking about the concept of implicit items in 
curricula. Much of the richness of a lesson comes not from the
description of the topic in the syllabus but also from related and
ancillary items that aren&#39;t specifically listed - implicit items. One
example I wrote about before is <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2010-01-10-towers-of-hanoi.html/">the Towers of Hanoi</a>. When I teach it,
on the one hand, it&#39;s a lesson about a recursive solution to a problem
but on the other hand there&#39;s all sorts of other richness to the
lesson. We talk about
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Proof
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Run time
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Hard problems
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Moores law and the limits f computing power
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Alternate approaches to problems
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
None of which is in a typical Towers of Hanoi lesson plan nor in most
text books yet to me they&#39;re the most important, interesting parts of
the lesson. 
</p>
<p>
Another example is when I talk about changing the data structure
rather than the code when I teach <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-02-26-change-the-data/">search</a>. 
</p>
<p>
In our Ed proposals one such place was when we move from using an
online IDE to a local development environment and discuss all sorts of ramifications
another is when we create a web application in our topics class and
things like authentication and security are discussed.
</p>
<p>
I spent most of this weekend going through our proposals and  making
sure it was clear everywhere we covered something relating to those &#34;5
areas&#34; of computer science.
</p>
<p>
The unfortunate thing is that of curricular material and  knowledge
isn&#39;t easy to collect and share with others.
</p>
<p>
I and others have written about lesson ideas on our blogs but there&#39;s
no searchable, shareable, discoverable  place for either basic lesson
material or these rich implicit items. I wrote about <a href="https://www.engage-csedu.org/">EngageCS</a> and
<a href="http://nifty.stanford.edu/">Nifty Assignments</a> <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/adapting-a-nifty-assignment/">before</a> but they&#39;re really core lesson ideas and
aren&#39;t really easy to find grab and use.
</p>
<p>
I guess the closest project moving in this direction is probably
<a href="https://cssplice-cm.github.io/">CSSplice Curriculum Materials Working Group</a> that I found out about
from <a href="https://twitter.com/AustinCorgiBart">Cory Bart</a> at this past SIGCSE.
</p>
<p>
Check out the project link and if you&#39;ve got a great lesson with lots
of implicit learnings going on, please share it in the comments.
