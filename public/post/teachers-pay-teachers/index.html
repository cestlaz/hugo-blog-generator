There was a bit of buzz a couple of months ago when Amazon announced
an online marketplace for educational resources. It wasn&#39;t a new
concept - on the pay side, <a href="https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/?msclkid=a426c2c1625613061bc19ce4cdcb6a0a&amp;utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Search%2520-%2520Branded%2520-%2520Desktop&amp;utm_term=teachers%2520pay%2520teachers&amp;utm_content=Brand%2520Name">Teachers Pay Teachers</a> has been around for a
while and in terms of free, there are many online resources but
they&#39;re not necessarily well organized or curated. What was the buzz?
Should teachers be charging their peers for class materials or should
they be providing them for free.
</p>
<p>
I was going to blog about it then but never got around to it The other
day, someone posted <a href="https://www.govtech.com/computing/Report-Most-Teacher-Created-Online-English-Materials-Subpar.html">this</a> article which questioned the quality of both
free resources and pay ones. The article, based on <a href="https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/research/supplemental-curriculum-bazaar">this report</a> by the
Fordham Institute looked at ELA resources. The report also only looked
at Teachers Pay Teachers and two free sites - ReadWriteThink and Share
My Lesson excluding many other teacher resources that could be, for
all we know, better curated and more discoverable. As an aside, I was
turned off by the reports referring to their evaluators as &#34;experts&#34;
which is a description I personally would question. Still, there&#39;s
some good fodder for thought.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll get to the report in the next post but for now let&#39;s tackle the
question that started the initial buzz - should teachers be charging
each other for materials?
</p>
<p>
It depends. If you&#39;re paid by a school to develop materials they
belong to the school. In NY you can take a sabbatical to build a
course so anything you build during that time would be DOE property
and therefore you couldn&#39;t sell it. Same thing if you&#39;re being paid
off hours to develop materials. The gray area comes when you&#39;re lesson
planning. Most real planning and development happens outside of
school hours. In an typical school day teacher are typically
allocated around 40 minutes to do all their planing, grading,
and paperwork so realistically most materials as well as planing,
paperwork, and grading are done off hours. This being the case, I&#39;m of
the belief that those materials belong to the teacher (although I&#39;ve
met some DOE educrats who would disagree).
</p>
<p>
So, should they sell it? Well, they have every right to. That said, my
personal feelings and practice is that if you&#39;ve developed something
for yourself and have not spent extra time or effort to prepare it for
others then I think you should make it freely available to your
peers. On the other hand, if you spend extra time and effort to make
it useful for and usable by others then by all means charge if you&#39;d
like.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll tackle the report in the next post and we&#39;ll look at some of the
resources available on the CS side.
