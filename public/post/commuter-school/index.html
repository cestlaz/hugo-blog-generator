One of the bigger challenges faced at commuter schools is building a
feeling of community. Students aren&#39;t on campus every day and come
from far afield and even when they are on campus, we really don&#39;t have
a CS &#34;hang out&#34; space. The space issue should be resolved soon - we&#39;re
scheduled to get a CS student lounge next semester.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m finding this to be even more of a challenge this year with my
honors students. The first two cohorts were a single class in
size. Even though some dormed and some commuted, they were all
together in my class twice a week. This year, we&#39;ve close to doubled
in size and about half of my students came in with a good deal of
prior CS knowledge. The result is that I have two different classes of
honors students and we are never all together unless it&#39;s for a
special event.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, we&#39;ve got one of my favorites coming up. 
</p>
<p>
In two weeks, I&#39;ll be taking about half my students up to <a href="http://catskillsconf.com">Catskills
Conf</a>. An event that I describe as light tech conference with a focus
on creativity and diversity meets summer camp. I&#39;ve written about the
event in in each of the past three years (<a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-10-29-catskills-2015/%0A">2015</a>, <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/catskillsconf-2016/%0A">2016</a>, <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/catskills-2017/%0A">2017</a>) and also
about the  <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/knitting-tech-conference/%0A">knitting for charity</a> event that Devorah runs during the
conference weekend.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a great event and if you&#39;re anywhere near the Hudson Valley
region you should <a href="http://catskillsconf.com">check it out</a>.
</p>
<p>
To start, it&#39;s a great first conference for the students. It only has
one track so no choices and the talks look really interesting this
year. Some of the ones I&#39;m looking forward to are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Designing for Access first
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Behind the Tech: Emoji
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Leaning into uncertainty
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The full schedule is <a href="https://catskillsconf.com/schedule/">here</a>. 
</p>
<p>
But also mixed in are activities like blacksmithing
</p>
<p>
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/img/commuter-school/blacksmith.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
</p>
<p>
and a live bird of prey show
</p>
<p>
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/img/commuter-school/BOP.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
</p>
<p>
There are also hikes that show off the beauty of Fall in the Hudson
Valley
</p>
<p>
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/img/commuter-school/nature1.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
</p>
<p>
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/img/commuter-school/nature2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
</p>
<p>
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/img/commuter-school/nature3.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
</p>
<p>
Rather than having the kids spread out in random hotel rooms we&#39;re all
in a camp style bunkhouse.
</p>
<p>
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/img/commuter-school/bunkhouse.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
</p>
<p>
The weekend is spent  living together along with technologists and
other creative types from NYC, the Hudson Valley and everywhere else. 
</p>
<p>
One of my favorite parts is at the end of each evening when we all
hang out by the campfire. Hunter CS students, company founders,
software engineers, designers.
</p>
<p>
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/img/commuter-school/campfire.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a great event overall and a great event to build community.
</p>
<p>
As I said before, if you&#39;re in the area, check it out.
