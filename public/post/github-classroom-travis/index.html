I&#39;ve been using GitHub with my classes since GitHub&#39;s early days. Over
time I&#39;ve gotten my <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse-2017-github-4/">workflows down</a>. I use a combination of shell
scripts - many just written on the fly, GitHub organizations, and some
naming conventions and protocols that have served me well. 
</p>
<p>
A few years ago, the <a href="https://education.github.com/">GitHub Education team</a> started <a href="https://classroom.github.com/">GitHub
Classroom</a>. I looked at it at the time. It was pretty cool but I had my
workflow so I didn&#39;t adopt it. I still very much liked GitHub, the
education team, and the product so I kept tabs on the project as time
passed. 
</p>
<p>
This semester I decided to go all in on GitHub Classroom. Why? A
combination of my changing my workflow and part due to the GitHub
education tools and community. At it&#39;s core, GitHub classroom does two
things well:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Assignment creation and distribution
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Repo management and organization.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I thought I&#39;d do a couple of posts and videos to show how I&#39;m using
everything. 
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s the first one.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly enough I&#39;m not going to talk at all about GitHub
classroom for the remainder of this post. Instead I&#39;m going to talk
about TravisCI (<a href="https://travis-ci.com/"><a href="https://travis-ci.com/">https://travis-ci.com/</a></a>,
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/">https://travis-ci.org/</a>). Travis is a platform for continuous
intergration. The idea is pretty simple. After setting things up,
whenever you push code to a repo that Travis is watching, Travis
starts a container for your repo and runs one or more scripts against
the repo. This usually means tests. It turns out that this can be a
useful sanity check for students. It&#39;s true that they can run tests on
their assignments before submitting them but this way it&#39;s done
automatically and after they submit. They can be sure that what
they&#39;ve submitted actually works.
</p>
<p>
First you have to link your GitHub accoutn with Travis. To do this,
just go to travis-ci.org and log in using GitHub. You can then set a
bunch of options including which repos to run Travis on. The interface
at travis-ci.com looks similar but a bit nicer. The .org site is free
for open source or public repos  (as is the .com site, I think) but
the good people at Travis will give you rights to use private repos
for educational purposes for free. 
</p>
<p>
The only other thing you have to do is create a <a href="https://yaml.org/">YAML</a> file named
 <code>.travis.yml</code> in your repo. Here&#39;s one I&#39;m using to test C++ projecs:
</p>
<div class="src src-yaml">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="color:#66d9ef">language</span>: cpp
<span style="color:#66d9ef">compiler</span>: clang
<span style="color:#66d9ef">script</span>:
  - make test
  - ./test</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
This tells Travis to use the clang compiler (as opposed to, say g++)
and then run <code>make test</code> and then <code>./test</code>. If all the tests pass you
get a green check and an email and you&#39;re good to go. If they don&#39;t
you get a red X and also an email. Of course for this particular
configuration to work you need <code>Makefile</code> and everything else needed
to build the tests in the repo. In my case, I&#39;m using <a href="https://github.com/onqtam/doctest">doctest</a> for tests.
</p>
<p>
Travis has support for a whole bunch of languages including Java,
Python, and JavaScript and all of those have nice testing frameworks
so regardless of what you&#39;re teaching with, Travis could be easily
integrated. 
</p>
<p>
In this video I show how I&#39;m using TravisCI and also a simple Python
setup. In the next post I&#39;ll get back to GitHub classroom and how
TravisCI integrates into it.
