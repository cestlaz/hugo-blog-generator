Programming is amazing. You get the thrill of victory and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asxr5v9arH4">the agony of
defeat</a>. It&#39;s a great feeling when you write something and it works -
even it it&#39;s small and simple. It also feels good to hunt down,
discover and eliminate subtle bugs in our code. On the other hand,
I&#39;ll frequently feel like a bozo when I pour over my code for days
only to find a super silly error. Unfortunately, that&#39;s the most kind
of error. It helps if you can laugh at yourself. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve
written about <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-12-17-im-an-idiot.html/">before</a>.
</p>
<p>
As a teacher it&#39;s something I try to convey to my students. When they
don&#39;t see a bug, it&#39;s probably not them. It&#39;s like when they read an
essay over and over and don&#39;t see their mistake because their brain
autocorrects.
</p>
<p>
So, what had me kicking myself this time?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m going to be teaching a CS topics course as part of our teacher
certification program this summer. I already have a lot of possible
topics to choose form:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
WebDev via Flask
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
3D Graphics / transformations
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Ray Tracing
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Data mining
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Machine Learning
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
NLP
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
and more
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I had never quite grokked <strong>Blockchain</strong> - specifically its use as a
platform so I thought I&#39;d see about that as a topic. I started
playing, exploring and building but when I got to signing transactions
that led me to add <strong>Public Key Encryption</strong> as another topic.
</p>
<p>
Traditional encryption requires a key to be used by both parties. This
means that both parties can both encrypt and decrypt so they must
trust each other. This leads to some issues:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Both parties have to share the key securely.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
All parties with the key can encrypt and decrypt. 
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
On the other hand, public key encryption uses two keys. A public one
that everyone has access to is used to encrypt data and a private one
known only to the owner. This can be used to decrypt the data. This
means I can share my public key with the world and receive secure
transmissions that only I can decrypt. It also means that two parties
can share secure data with each other without both parties knowing the
others private key.
</p>
<p>
I decided that it would be a good idea to get my head around all of
this.
</p>
<p>
There are a bunch of good resources on the web but the basic idea is
that you take two primes - large primes, multiply them together, chant
some mystic incantations and come up with a private and a public
key. You can then use one key to encrypt a message and the other to
decrypt that encrypted message. 
</p>
<p>
For this to work, you want to use large primes but to work through the
math and make sure I got it, I started with small numbers - 7
and 13. I went through all the math, everything worked and it made
sense.
</p>
<p>
Now time to write some code.
</p>
<p>
I wrote up a small program and things seemed to work and then decided
to set up a mock student application - something that would encrypt a
sentence. If I were writing this &#34;for real&#34; I would figure out some
reasonable way to chunk my data for encryption but for this test I
figured it would be easy to just take each character from the input
string and encrypt it.
</p>
<p>
First few tests worked. I encrypted and decrypted &#34;ABC.&#34; Then I tried
the classic &#34;Hello World!&#34; and things went kablooey.
</p>
<p>
I was getting weird results and couldn&#39;t for the life of me figure out
why. Every time I did an individual test it seemed to work.
</p>
<p>
Finally, it clicked - Duh, of course it wasn&#39;t working.
</p>
<p>
When you encrypt or decrypt a number, which in our case is a
character, it involves modulo arithmetic. Given a  number <strong>X</strong> you
calculate \(X^e\  mod\  n\ \) where e is your key and n is the product of the
primes you selected. I chose 7 and 13 as my primes which made my
 <strong>n</strong> 91. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>OF COURSE IT DIDN&#34;T WORK!!!!!</strong> It worked for A, B, and C because
they had ascii values of 65, 66, and 67 -  all less than 91. Once I
added lower case letters all was lost. The characeter &#39;e&#39; has an ascii
code of 101. There&#39;s no way I can get some encoded value back to 101
if I&#39;m modding by 91. 
</p>
<p>
D&#39;oh
</p>
<p>
From there it was an easy fix - I just had to account for this. I
selected larger primes, derived new keys and everything worked. 
</p>
<p>
I felt pretty stupid but on the other hand I got that surge of joy at
it finally working.
</p>
<p>
Now I can confidently add both Public Key Encryption and Blockchain to
possible topics for my classes. It was also another reminder that
finding bugs is hard. That&#39;s something not only important for us to
remember but also important that we convince our students of this.
