Over at <a href="https://avc.com">AVC</a> Fred Wilson just posted about <a href="https://avc.com/2020/03/outschool-can-help-your-school-prepare-for-unexpected-closures/">Outschool&#39;s efforts</a>
to support students and teachers in the event of school closures due
to the Coronavirus. All the details and relevant links are in the
post. 
</p>
<p>
I looked a bit into Outschool when Fred first <a href="https://avc.com/2019/05/outschooling/">wrote about them</a> but
never had a chance to do a deep dive.
</p>
<p>
Now, internet based teaching is not going to be as effective as in
person teaching but I was thinking about how far things have come.
</p>
<p>
After superstorm Sandy, Stuy was closed for about a week. Instead of
losing all the time my classes and I decided to try to do us some
internet schooling. We used Google tools and things went pretty well. 
</p>
<p>
I wrote about what we did and some concluding thoughts <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2012-10-31-sandy-bridge.html/">here</a> and
<a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2012-11-02-back-to-work/">here</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Back then - 2012 - the technology was close but not quite there. Now,
with tools like <a href="https://zoom.us">Zoom</a> and I&#39;m guessing <a href="https://outschool.com/">Outschool</a>, which is probably
more fine tuned for education rather than meetings you have some nice
all in one or at least most in one solutions. I had to use a YouTube
broadcast and separate documents and chats. Today&#39;s tools tie all of
those together along with screen sharing. Maybe Outschool even has a
shared virtual blackboard - that would be pretty cool. Add in
something like Trello and GitHub and we&#39;re really cooking.
</p>
<p>
It really reminds me that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Wave">Google Wave</a> was really a product ahead of
it&#39;s time. 
</p>
<p>
As I said above, internet teaching will not be as effective as
live. It&#39;s more of a show and do rather than an interactive class and
I go through some of the other issues in the my two posts linked above
but we&#39;re getting better. Certainly way better than closing a school
and doing nothing. 
</p>
<p>
Hats off to Outschool for providing their services to the community. I
hope few have to use them but am thankful they&#39;re there.
