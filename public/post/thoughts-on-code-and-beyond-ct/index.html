The theme of this year&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/1084877641285541889">To Code and Beyond</a> was Computational
Thinking. <a href="https://twitter.com/guzdial">Mark Guzdial</a> gave the keynote. While the talk isn&#39;t
currently online, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3uCb-95fFE&amp;t=5s">this talk</a> that Mark gave last March. It&#39;s
not the same but the second halves are and well worth a look.
</p>
<p>
In the first half, Mark talked about other types of &#34;thinking.&#34;
Scientific thinking, engineering thinking and even historical
thinking. All had a good amount of overlap with both each other and
with computational thinking even as we haven&#39;t yet settled on what
computational thinking actually is.
</p>
<p>
This overlap is why I think that bringing CS into the primary grades
gives us an opportunity to reduce the achievement gap between rich and
poor. 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve already said that I&#39;m not sold on hardcore CS and programming in
the early grades but rather it&#39;s CT - the problem solving and
methodologies of CS that can effectively be part of the earlier
grades.
</p>
<p>
Of course, that&#39;s easier said than done. While there has been some
pushback recently we still have far too much emphasis on standardized
tests and elementary school teachers are way overworked. Trying to get
already overburdened teachers to add in a whole new subject area is a
big ask. The opportunity is that we might be able to develop aspects
of CT in a way that supports what elementary teachers are already
doing, possibly under the unlabeled guise of scientific thinking,
historical thinking, engineering thinking or some other thinking.
</p>
<p>
This is already going on to a certain extent with individual teachers
at individual schools. Logic games and problem solving techniques have
always been explored by elementary school teachers who have freedom
from tightly packed test based curricula. These could be considered CT
and you could also add data collection and processing and I&#39;m sure
many other things as well. This is where CS/CT can fit in the
elementary schools without adding to the teacher&#39;s current
load. What&#39;s more, if we can figure out how to incorporate these CT
concepts to support the subject matter already being studied we could
help close the gap between the haves and the have nots.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve said many times before that I&#39;m not an elementary school
specialist but I still suspect this is the approach for CS in the
primary grades at least for the near term. 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve already got a pretty full plate between my work with Hunters
Daedalus CS honors program along with our pre-service programs being
very close to going live but I&#39;m also hoping to do some work in
relating to this in the near future.
