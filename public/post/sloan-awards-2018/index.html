I spent yesterday evening at the Cooper Union in their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Union#The_Foundation_Building&#39;s_Great_Hall">Great
Hall</a>, a place famous for Abraham Lincoln&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Union_speech#External_links">speech</a> that some say
propelled him to the presidency.
</p>
<p>
I was there in the audience watching as the Sloan Foundation and the
Fund for the City of New York awarded seven public school teachers
with an ward for &#34;Excellence in the Teaching of Science and
Mathematics.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I was their to see my friend Dave Deutsch, a long time public school
physics teacher receive the honor. Here&#39;s a brief clip about Dave:
</p>
<p>
&lt;iframe src=&#34;<a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/304871223">https://player.vimeo.com/video/304871223</a>&#34; width=&#34;640&#34;
height=&#34;360&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</p>
<p>
You can read Dave&#39;s blurb as well as blurbs and videos for all of the
recipients <a href="https://www.fcny.org/fcny/core/sae/2018_winners/#david-deutsch">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve never taught with Dave but I&#39;ve known him for a couple of decades
and he&#39;s a teacher&#39;s teacher. He and Devorah cut their teeth teaching
together at the Manhattan Center for Science and Math. Dave&#39;s still
there. 
</p>
<p>
Dave&#39;s also not the guy that normally gets awards. It&#39;s not because he
doesn&#39;t deserve them - he&#39;s probably the best physics / science
teacher I know. It&#39;s that he never toots his own horn, he&#39;s not the
over the top super charismatic popular teacher who seems great in the
moment but in the long run might not be, and he never looks for the
spotlight. He just goes about his business of connecting, inspiring,
and truly caring about his kids. His value as an educator can be seen
not only in the short term in his classes but in the long run through
his former students.
</p>
<p>
He&#39;s the best.
</p>
<p>
Over the years I tried to pull Dave over to Stuy or involve him in
other projects but he&#39;s always stayed true to Manhattan Center and
it&#39;s population even with the school&#39;s toxic administration (it&#39;s
worth noting that Dave&#39;s video is the only one that didn&#39;t include the
school&#39;s principal lauding the recipient and was the only principal
not present at the festivities).
</p>
<p>
In any event, Dave&#39;s a true champion for the public school students of
NYC and a true hero. There are a small handful of teachers that I
really look up to and Dave Deutsch is one of them.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s to Dave and other teachers who never get the recognition they
deserve because they&#39;re too busy doing the good work rather than self
promoting.
