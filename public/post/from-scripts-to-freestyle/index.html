Bethany writes that while she normally essentially scripts important
presentations, this time she went more off the cuff.
</p>
<p>
It made me think about how I teach and a disturbing trend I&#39;ve
seen in CS education and education in general.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve never strictly used a script for teaching. When I started I did
use <strong>very</strong> detailed lesson plans. Back then I was teaching math. It
was also pre internet or at least pre internet as we now know
it. I had an account on <a href="https://www.panix.com/">Panix</a> and the internet did indeed exist but
you couldn&#39;t just look for teaching materials. I actually remember
bringing a modem in to Seward Park one day and showing a bunch of kids
this up and coming thing called the internet. I showed them usernet
news, a gopher server and a couple of other things.
</p>
<p>
In terms of teaching materials, you could buy sample lesson plans from
the teacher store near the Board of Ed in Brooklyn. These were books
that were compilations of mostly handwritten lessons. 
</p>
<p>
I basically copied and modified them. I had an <strong>aim</strong>, a <strong>do now</strong> key
questions were written as were definitions and summary
statements. Of course there were numerous sample problems and
exercises, all worked out
in advance. It wasn&#39;t quite a script but it was a very well fleshed
out guide 
</p>
<p>
As I gained experience and also shifted from math which wasn&#39;t my
passion to CS, my plans become sparser. I&#39;d still write down
definitions, maybe some solutions and a list of key points but a lot
of the particulars were gone. I didn&#39;t write out key questions or
solutions to all the problems in advance. 
</p>
<p>
As time went by the plans got sparser still. I&#39;d still list the key
points I&#39;d want to cover as well as notes on tricky parts of the
lesson but more often than not I&#39;ll just go in with a bullet list.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s my plan for a recent lesson:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Go over cipher soution
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
How to we solve if already ciphered?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Rotate 26 times.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
What about using stats
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Frequency of letters - look up
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Find freq of letter in string then use distance formula against
model
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Get frequencies from a book
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
try it in another language
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We didn&#39;t get to the last two bullet items so that&#39;s where we&#39;ll start
off on Monday. This plan was all I needed but it in no way tells the
full story of the lesson to anyone but me. It doesn&#39;t include the
motivation, ancillary stories and materials nor how the lesson was
developed or delivered. I knew how it would play out because I was
teaching it and for me these notes were more than sufficient. 
</p>
<p>
All this is not to say that I don&#39;t spend a lot of time planning my
lessons. I do. I just don&#39;t create detailed scripts. I know what I
want to cover and how I want to cover it. Then it&#39;s just got to the
class and go.
</p>
<p>
A big advantage of this is something that Bethany mentioned in her
piece - the ability to &#34;read the room.&#34; This is a big part of
teaching. If you&#39;re following a script, you&#39;re not reading the room
and you&#39;re probably not really teaching the class. You might be
following a script but your students certainly aren&#39;t and once they
veer off program you&#39;ve got to abandon your script or you&#39;re not doing
right by the class. 
</p>
<p>
Having a direction but not a script makes it easier to &#34;call and
audible.&#34; That&#39;s what led me to teach the <a href="/post/who-played-spiderman/">question answering system</a>
lesson the other day. It was unplanned but as a class we were having a
discussion and that&#39;s where it led.
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned, when I started out I couldn&#39;t do this. I needed much
more detailed plans. That said, as a teacher gains more experience
they can better connect to their classes and do more for their
students by not sticking to the script, reading the room and adapting.
</p>
<p>
This brings me to that trend that disturbing trend. I&#39;m talking about
pushing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/11/30/teacher-slams-scripted-common-core-lessons-that-must-be-taught-word-for-word/?utm_term=.6afd6d64f1c6">scripted lessons</a>. These crop up in charter schools and no
excuse environments and are typically used as ways of &#34;compensating&#34;
for teachers that don&#39;t really know the subject area or how to teach
and to standardize teaching. To me it&#39;s an attack on the teaching
profession. A script is great for a play. It&#39;s great for a speech and
for some presentations but not for teaching. 
</p>
<p>
I understand having something that&#39;s more scripted to use when you&#39;re
faced with novice teachers or teachers that are new to a subject area
but I fear that at times the scripted lessons are the end game.
</p>
<p>
I was talking to a friend a few years ago. He&#39;s doing great work in the
CS Ed space and among other things, he develops curricula. I mentioned
to him that I loved his work (still do) but I was concerned that his
materials were becoming much more scripted. His reply was something
like &#34;I agree with you in theory but the truth is most teachers aren&#39;t
you.&#34; I understood his point as most of the teachers that used his
materials were novices but I disagreed that they were &#34;not me.&#34; I&#39;m
nothing special. I&#39;m just a reasonably bright guy who works hard at
his craft. If I can teach script free so can anyone. Maybe not at
first, but certainly after time and we subvert our profession by
settling for less. 
</p>
<p>
As a final note, at this point in my career I actually find it very
hard to use a script - even for a presentation. Over the last couple
of years, I&#39;ve been spending my Falls visiting high schools to talk
about Hunter&#39;s <a href="http://info.huntercs.org">Honors CS</a> program. As much as I tried, I couldn&#39;t
script a presentation. No matter what I did, when I got in front of
the students I just ended up doing my thing and talking to them. At
the end of the day I ended up working things backwards. Over my first
few school visits, I developed a set of key points that I kept coming
back to and finally ended up with a list of bullet points that I can
pretty much follow when I do the &#34;navigating from high school to
college in tech&#34; talk. I guess I&#39;m now working in reverse. Starting
free style and working back to a script.
