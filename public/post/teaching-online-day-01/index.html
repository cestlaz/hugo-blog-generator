I taught my first two online classes this morning. The first one from
8:10 - 9:25 and the second from 9:45 - 11:00.
</p>
<p>
Toolset:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Zoom meetings
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Emacs (yes, not just an editor)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
First up Zoom.
</p>
<p>
I think I want a video camera on policy. All my students should have
laptops with working cameras. Some students might have issues with
showing even a small bit of what&#39;s behind them so I don&#39;t want to make
it required but I really wish they&#39;d also have cameras on.
</p>
<p>
Why?
</p>
<p>
To get some level of visual feedback and interaction. Having made over
60 <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs/">Emacs videos</a> I&#39;m used to talking to my own screen but when you know
you&#39;ve got a live audience that you&#39;re working with it&#39;s different. If
I&#39;m just talking to a bunch of black boxes with names in them I don&#39;t
feel any connection with my students. If I see them I feel we&#39;re
together.
</p>
<p>
This was also an issue when I went to screen sharing. Now Zoom handled
the screen sharing terrifically.  You can share either one specific
window, a virtual whiteboard or your whole screen. When sharing,
though, instead of seeing a bunch of small windows with lots of people
in them you only see around four which isn&#39;t representative of the
whole class. Better than nothing but I wish I had a long line of boxes
that could easily scroll.
</p>
<p>
Another thing with the screen sharing - it worked great but this is
also where two monitors would be helpful. I went from two 30&#34; monitors
to one 43&#34; 4K monitor. I love my current setup but it seems with Zoom
you share all or nothing. I&#39;m guessing with two monitors I could share
one monitor and use the other for notes and staging. With one big
monitor I can&#39;t do this - I have to share the whole screen. Not a huge
problem but makes things a bit less smooth.
</p>
<p>
This is where Emacs comes in.
</p>
<p>
For a decent part of the lesson, I&#39;d share my Emacs window. Since I
can split the window and quickly jump between buffers (screens) I
could bring up a variety of things. I had a shell in one buffer so I
could run terminal stuff, a source code buffer, one in org-mode for
outlines and table work and one in artist mode for rudimentary
diagramming. I think it worked reasonably well for a first shot.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we also used the Zoom chat. Some students would mic on and
off to take part but more used the chat. It was a bit weird at
first. I&#39;d talk, they&#39;d write but both classes got into a pretty good
tempo after a while. I think it could work. Interesting though was
that my first class had a bunch of cross class chat in the general
(public) chat during the lesson. Silly remarks back and forth. Truth
be told, I liked it. My second class didn&#39;t although there might have
been some of that in private chats.
</p>
<p>
I asked the classes to share what their other instructors are doing
and using and I&#39;m really interested in hearing. I&#39;m also hoping that
they&#39;re open with me in terms of what&#39;s working and what isn&#39;t. I want
this to be the best experience for them that we can create and I&#39;m not
so proud as to think I know how to do it and that they don&#39;t know
better.
</p>
<p>
Now to plan for the next one.
