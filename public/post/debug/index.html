            <p>
Yesterday&#39;s post on <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/errors-are-hard-to-find/">errors</a> led to some interesting discussion over on
Facebook. Specifically on teaching students to use a debugger. 
</p>
<p>
My contention is that while it&#39;s easy to demonstrate a debugger it&#39;s
hard to get student buy in. In my CS0, we start with <a href="https://thonny.org/">Thonny</a> which has
a great integrated debugger. In my CS1 I also show and use
gdb. Regardless of my approach the subset of students who actively end
up using the debugger has remained both constant and small.
</p>
<p>
A few students will use the debugger in the very early stages to help
understand basic constructs but fewer will go back to the tool later
when a real error occurs. One of the difficulties probably relates to
the fact that it&#39;s hard to present a natural, organic example of using
a debugger. You either have to force an appropriate error situation or
you have to wait and hope for the right situation to present itself at
a good time.
</p>
<p>
Truth be told, I don&#39;t use debuggers all that much. Mostly, I&#39;ll use
them in C or C++ to get in the ballpark of where my error is - usually
via postmortem debugging. 
</p>
<p>
In any event, while the students should know of the existence and
power of debugging tools the real skill is how to think about your
craft.
</p>
<p>
Whether one uses a debugger or print statements the questions are
really: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
what problem is the student trying to solve - do they understand it?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
How are they solving it?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
What specifically are they telling their program to do? 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That last one is important. I always tell my students that &#34;Computers
are really bad at doing what you want them to do but they&#39;re really
good at what you tell them to do!&#34; 
</p>
<p>
Here are some errors that I&#39;ve seen stump kids time and time again:
</p>
<p>
A typical intro to recursion problem is the Fibonacci numbers. The
recursive definition gives:
</p>
<p>
\[
f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
1 &amp; if x \leq 2 \\
f(n-1) + f(n-2) &amp; otherwise
\end{array}
\right.
\]
</p>
<p>
This translates directly to code
</p>
<div class="src src-java">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">
  </code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
See the problem?
</p>
<p>
I see this at least a couple of times a year. 
</p>
<p>
The student writes <code>(n-1) + (n-2)</code> instead of <code>f(n-1) + f(n-2)</code>. In
fact, when they read off their code they&#39;re more likely than not to
say it correctly - the brain autocorrects. It&#39;s just when you read an
essay with a glaring mistake over and over. A debugger might bring
attention to this but then so can careful code tracing. This is a time
that rubber duck debugging can also be effective. Another good
strategy would be to just take a break and come back with fresh eyes.
</p>
<p>
Another one is when students are starting to work with loops and
arrays. I&#39;ve seen all sorts of variations on the error so will only
share one. Suppose the students are looking for the largest in a data
set. I might see code like this:
</p>
<div class="src src-java">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">
  </code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Once again, the student will usually describe the algorithm correctly
but their code is comparing adjacent elements not each element against
a &#34;source of truth.&#34; The computer is doing what they told it to do not
what they want it to do.
</p>
<p>
A debugger would probably be more helpful here but again, it all comes
down to careful analysis of the code. 
</p>
<p>
In the previous two examples, a debugger could help but the real
requirement is careful code tracing be it via tool, print statements
or by hand. Here&#39;s an example where a debugger can really shed some
light for a beginner. This time in C++:
</p>
<div class="src src-c++">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c++" data-lang="c++">
</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
What causes the error isn&#39;t important. What happens is that students
start to add print statements and ultimately get to the point where a
print is the very first line of the program and it still outputs
nothing.
</p>
<p>
The culprit here is output buffering. <code>cout</code> is the same as
 <code>System.out.print</code> - no newline. The output buffers and won&#39;t actually
appear until you send a <code>\n</code>. If your program crashes before then you
won&#39;t see anything. This is why we have <code>cerr</code> in C++,  <code>stderr</code> for C
and <code>System.err</code> in Java. The error streams are unbuffered and will
 output immediately. Not as good but still effective would be adding a
 newline to the original print statement. 
</p>
<p>
In any event, this is a case where stepping through with a debugger
can be truly enlightening. 
</p>
<p>
Now with all of this, the real key is to carefully consider what
you&#39;re trying to do and how you end up communicating it in
program. I&#39;d love to find a way to convince more students of the
utility of a good toolset that includes debuggers but I&#39;d also just
love to be more effective in getting them to carefully read and
analyze their code.
