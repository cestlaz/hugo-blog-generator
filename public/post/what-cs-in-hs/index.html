I wanted to chime in on Alfred Thompson&#39;s post last week on <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2018/09/deciding-what-to-include-in-high-school.html">what to
include in a HS CS class</a> but was working on moving blogging platforms
so didn&#39;t get a chance so I&#39;ll say a few words here.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;ve been here before you probably know I&#39;m not a fan of <a href="/posts/standards-who-for/">the
standards</a> and I certainly am no fan of the College Board and the AP
program so what&#39;s my take?
</p>
<p>
The truth is, my take doesn&#39;t matter. Not in terms of specifics
anyway. Every school is different. Different kids, teachers, parents,
community, and culture so while there might be some things from the
program I designed at Stuy that work at another school there will be
plenty of things that don&#39;t. I&#39;m now designing first year experiences
at Hunter and while I take lessons earned away from my Stuy
experience, I&#39;m now teaching different kids in a different environment
so the answer to the question &#34;what do I teach them and how?&#34; is different.
</p>
<p>
The important thing to consider are the questions you should ask and
the answers you come up with.
</p>
<p>
The first question is &#34;why?&#34; Why are you doing CS in your school? Is
it for kids already interested in CS? Is it &#34;for all?&#34; In either case,
what do you want them to get out of it?
</p>
<p>
Is it for employment after high school? If so you might want to
consider locally used tools and technologies and also look at more
vocational tech like DevOps, SysAdmin and networking.
</p>
<p>
Is it in support of other classes while in high school or college? You
might want to look at aspects of CS that cross over into other disciplines.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ll then have other questions dealing with resources, class size,
required classes vs electives and so on.
</p>
<p>
At some point schools get to the point of figuring out what specific
topics to include. Many teachers now veer to an assortment of hot
topics that interest them or alternatively go the other way and try to
do whatever the students want. I&#39;m not a  big fan of either. Don&#39;t get
me wrong, if I worked in a rich private institution with tiny class
sizes and lots of resources I&#39;d love to be student directed after the
basics but that&#39;s a luxury that public school educators can&#39;t really
afford. I&#39;m also not a fan of the &#34;hot topic&#34; approach. 
</p>
<p>
At Stuy, I tried to look at the complete sequence as a program. I
wanted the designation of &#34;Stuy CS graduate&#34; to mean something so I
looked at what the kids trajectories were after graduation and I tried
to develop a program that best launched them on that trajectory. That
meant designing an intro class that could both launch CS minded kids
into our more advanced classes and also give non-CS kids everything
they needed for their next levels. 
</p>
<p>
The motivation and design of the intro course is a topic unto itself
but I&#39;ll share what I considered when designing our post AP CS
courses. One of the first guidelines I follow is &#34;don&#39;t give them a
course that they&#39;ll have to take later anyway.&#34; A second is &#34;set up
courses that support the students in what they&#39;ll have to take later&#34;
and finally &#34;fill in the gaps.&#34; 
</p>
<p>
With this in mind, we ended up with a Graphics course, Systems course
and a two semester Software Development class and it&#39;s worked pretty
well. 
</p>
<p>
Had I been at another school and designed it&#39;s sequence it would
likely look different. I would have developed the program the same
way but would likely have ended up with something different albeit
with similar themes.
</p>
<p>
I get emails and calls now and then from schools asking for advice on
building their CS programs. Some want the easy way out - they want a
drop in curriculum with little regard for the fit or worse, they want
APCS because it&#39;s AP. Those conversations usually don&#39;t go
anywhere. Other schools ask for help and ask for a curriculum. I&#39;ll
say I can&#39;t help with that but I&#39;d love to talk and to get to know the
school and together we can come up with the right program. That&#39;s a
longer process and is more work. It&#39;s also more likely to result in a
good sustainable program and building those are both better and a lot
more fun.
