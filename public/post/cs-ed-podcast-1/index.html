I saw a couple of posts the other day about the <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/csedpodcast/">CS Ed Podcast</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Kristin Stephens-Martinez of Duke interviewed (or will interview) six
CS educators on a variety of topics. There are four posted so far:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
David Malan
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Dan Garcia
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Amy Ko
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Mark Guzdial
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Before I started I thought I&#39;d listen to a few and then share some
thoughts but I found so much to unpack  in the second episode where
Dan talks about testing that I decided to share my thoughts on the
first episode, then Dan&#39;s and then see if find anything to comment on
in episodes three and beyond.
</p>
<p>
All the podcasts are available via the link above and transcripts are
also provided - a nice touch for a number of reasons. It not only
increases accessibility, it also makes the episodes potentially more
discoverable via search engine and certainly more searchable. For me it was
helpful as I only listen to podcasts while working out - running or in
the gym so being able to search a text page to double check what I
thought I heard while struggling to finish mile six or seven was a
boon.
</p>
<p>
In episode 1, Stephens-Martinez interviewed David Malan of CS50
fame. The interview was mostly about tools used in CS50.
</p>
<p>
Even though I&#39;m not going to comment on CS50 as it wasn&#39;t the direct
topic of the interview I feel I should share my bias in case any comes
through. I&#39;m not a fan of CS50. This is an opinion I formed by talking
to a number of my former students who have taken/TA&#39;d CS50 and/or
courses that follow it combined with my own thoughts and beliefs about
CS Education. That said, I have no first hand exposure to Harvard&#39;s
CS50 nor have I ever met Mr. Malan so I reserve the right to change my
point of view at some point in the future.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-1">
Summary stats
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Did I enjoy the podcast? Yes - I&#39;d give it 4/5 on the making running
bearable scale. The interview flowed well and a lot of information
was shared. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Did I learn anything? Honestly, no. This was probably due to the
topic but more on that below.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Should you listen? Yes. Again, more below.
</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="headline-2">
Thoughts
</h3>
<p>
A theme of the podcast was that Malan wants his students to be exposed
to and end up using real tools but uses the CS50 tools to scaffold
their way. Not having a huge amount of exposure I won&#39;t comment on how
well this works but it&#39;s philosophically similar to my beliefs where I
start my beginners in a simplified environment like Thonny for Python
and have them &#34;graduate&#34; up to a more full featured yet less forgiving
editor. 
</p>
<p>
One of the tools they talked about was <a href="https://github.com/cs50/help50">help50</a> - a command line tool to
improve on error messages (there&#39;s also a web interface
availabe). Instead of typing <code>gcc myfile.c</code> students would type
<code>hepl50 gcc myfile.c</code> and instead of getting just the cryptic error
message you&#39;d also get an improved message. In my short time playing
with it I couldn&#39;t actually get a better error but I only played with
it for a few minutes. 
</p>
<p>
I like the idea of sharing both the original error message as well as
the improved one but can&#39;t really comment further. What I would have
loved to hear, however was how they transition the kids first to use
the tool and then to grow out of it. I&#39;d also be curious to see if
there were differences between adoption of  and graduation from the
tool as well as it&#39;s effectiveness for the Harvard population where
everyone is pre-selected to be high performing in terms of class
performance vs an institution that takes all comers. 
</p>
<p>
Another tool I liked was <a href="https://cs50.readthedocs.io/style50/">style50</a> which tells you if and how your code
violates coding standards but doesn&#39;t automatically fix it.
</p>
<p>
This is something I show my classes just using our editors style
checkers. I have Emacs set up to give me a red tick when I violate
style but only says what&#39;s wrong when I move the cursor over and it
doesn&#39;t auto correct. 
</p>
<p>
I like this as it raises student awareness but they actually have to
make the change and learn to either code in an approved style or make
a conscious decision to violate style.
</p>
<p>
For me, the missing part of the interview was the &#34;how.&#34; How do you
get the students to adopt the tool and how do you get them to outgrow
them. 
</p>
<p>
At the end, podcasts get to share something from tech that they find
cool and Mr. Malan shared containers - Docker images as an
example. The idea that you can package something for students and know
that they all get the same package with the same versions of all the
required tools. That seems to make sense but I think there&#39;s another
side, a downside  to containers both in terms of using them in classes
and in terms of the direction we&#39;re going with containers in tech. All
of that though is a topic for another day.
</p>
<p>
The podcast also covered other tools and if you haven&#39;t listened yet
you should. 
</p>
<p>
As I found a lot of rich material in Dan&#39;s interview I&#39;ll almost
certainly write something about that. Also probably on Amy&#39;s about
debugging. Spoiler alert - both are worth listening to. Dan&#39;s runs
about 40 minutes and Amy&#39;s 24. I haven&#39;t listened to Mark&#39;s yet but
expect that to be worth our time as well.
</p>
<p>
One thing I do want to point out is that all six interviews for this
series are of college professors - no K12 teachers. Not sure why that
decision was made but I found it to be interesting. Anyone who knows
me is aware that I&#39;m much more of a teacher as craftsman guy rather
than a &#34;the research says&#34; guy so I have my bias but regardless, I
think that interviewing a professor, a high school teacher, and an
early grade teacher could give some very interesting and contrasting
perspectives.
