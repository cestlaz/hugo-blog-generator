When we first went remote I jumped on Zoom. I already new the
technology and it most simulated a live class. Basically, it was the
best combination if quick, easy, and effective and we were under the
gun to get something going and give our students some sense of
normalcy and continuity.
</p>
<p>
As we settled in though, it made sense to try some different
things. One was the &#34;lab packet.&#34; A self contained document with
instructions and partial walkthroughs. One of my classes is already
set up to do a number of labs in this way so that was an easy thing to
try.  Basically it ended up being an asynchronous experience with me
being available using the usual suspects - Slack and email. 
</p>
<p>
I tried something different this past Monday. It was synchronous with
me available on Slack but we didn&#39;t use Zoom. I set up a series of
videos. Each video was fairly short and most had a small assignment at
the end. I asked the class to fill out a form after each
video/assignment. The topic was binary trees.
</p>
<p>
The whole process seemed to go well but I&#39;ll report back once I&#39;ve
finished going over the feedback emails I&#39;ve gotten from the class.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m particularly proud of this video that I made for the class, enjoy:
