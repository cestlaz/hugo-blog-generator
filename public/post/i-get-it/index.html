I was reading Mary Clair Wright&#39;s new <a href="https://computationalthinkinginroom112.com/">blog</a> the other day. It&#39;s always
great to see another teacher sharing publicly online.
</p>
<p>
One line caught my eye in her <a href="https://computationalthinkinginroom112.com/2020/04/07/ap-csa-enrichment-gone-awry/">latest post</a> - 
</p>

Remote instruction is weird, I can’t see them. I have to trust that they will message me with questions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</p>
<p>
This is a real problem. It&#39;s hard enough in a regular class where we
can pick up an all sorts of cues and use all sorts formal and informal
assessments but when the students are on the other end of a
teleconference or even more challenging an email or chat it&#39;s even
harder.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s also a reminder of how important those non verbal clues and
student feedback can be.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s great if we can create an environment where our students will ask
for help if they don&#39;t know something but even under normal
circumstances there&#39;s the danger of students thinking they get
it. If a student is totally lost they&#39;ll usually know they&#39;re totally
lost but after that, it&#39;s not so clear. 
</p>
<p>
A student might think they get it if they can basically follow along
with what&#39;s being presented. It&#39;s pretty easy to watch another student
or a teacher go through explaining a solution step by step and think
you really know what&#39;s going on. Similarly they can read through an
example in a text or on a web site and think they understand. A little
better is when they can do the first couple of problems in the book
but those frequently mimic the samples and don&#39;t require any
additional insight. Even in a traditional class a student can go week
to week like this and really think they understand things and then
they get hit over the head on a test or right before a big assignment
is due. 
</p>
<p>
This isn&#39;t the student&#39;s fault. It&#39;s hard to know what you don&#39;t know
and truth be told, we don&#39;t really teach our students how to study and
self assess. It&#39;s also really hard for teachers to assess this even in
person. Now that we&#39;re all remote it&#39;s yet another huge red flag to
look out for.
</p>
<p>
No solutions here today and no suggestions just yet another concern as
we continue to work to do right by our kids.
