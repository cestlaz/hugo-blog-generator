Many teachers are reluctant to try new things. Sometimes it&#39;s a bad
case of &#34;I&#39;vealwaysdoneitthisway-itis.&#34; Sometimes it&#39;s not being
comfortable with the new way or not having the time to develop
whatever happens to be needed for the lesson and sometimes it&#39;s even
coming from a good place. 
</p>
<p>
What&#39;s that good place? Concern - if I try this new way and it doesn&#39;t
work I&#39;m going to lose some students and never get them back. My
population is too at risk. 
</p>
<p>
Ok, I buy that but I don&#39;t agree with it.
</p>
<p>
There will be a normal ebb and flow to your lessons anyway. Some days
will be great, some not so much. Some lessons will be amazing, some
will put the kids to sleep. Besides, you can almost always recover
from a bad experience the following week.
</p>
<p>
Last week was Quicksort time. I&#39;ve approached the problem in a variety
of ways over the years. I straight out presented the algorithm,
approached it from a <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2010-03-14-sorting-from-top-and-from-bottom.html/">functional point of view</a>, <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/quick-sort-starting/">put a specific element
in place</a>, approached it from a <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-03-12-select-to-sort.html/">select the nth smallest</a> item point of view
and probably a few others.
</p>
<p>
This time, I thought I&#39;d try code tracing. The motivation was that the
in place partition algorithm can be a little hairy. The idea is
actually pretty simple but first year CS2 students can find it
difficult. This time, I presented them with the code and some trial
runs for them to trace through. From there we developed the algorithm
</p>
<p>
I won&#39;t know if this approach was effective or not until next week but
my gut was telling me that it was a bit bumpy. I don&#39;t think I was
effectively  able to connect from the code they worked through up to
the algorithm. Some of the other approaches I&#39;ve tried over the years
left me equally unimpressed with myself but at the end of the day they
weren&#39;t disasters so I&#39;m guessing the class will ultimately prove to
have been alright. Right now, I think the approach I used a couple of
years ago of motivating quicksort by putting a specific element in
place works best for me and my classes. 
</p>
<p>
The moral of the story? I tried something. I don&#39;t think it worked
particularly well. That&#39;s okay. I&#39;ll probably rework it and try it
again in the future but as for today I know my kids will be
fine. Maybe I botched the quicksort a bit but I&#39;ll fix that over the
next few classes.
</p>
<p>
The real lesson of the day - Don&#39;t be afraid to try something new. We
want our students to be unafraid of failure. We should be as
well. It&#39;s rare the stakes are so high that we can&#39;t stumble an bumble
a bit of a lesson and not recover. 
</p>
<p>
When I was just starting out one of my mentors gave me some great
advice: &#34;You can always fix it tomorrow.&#34;
