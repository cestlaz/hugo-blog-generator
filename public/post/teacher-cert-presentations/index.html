Well, we just delivered the last formal piece of instruction for the
summer intensive. Writing this post between visits to breakout rooms
as the cohort works on their final projects.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow and Thursday will be presentation time. Each group will give
spend thirty minutes teaching us all about some topic in CS along with
the plan for how we could teach the topic to our kids. We&#39;ve got a few
more things to talk about as a group but it&#39;s mostly time to sit back
and enjoy the show.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a long hard month for JonAlf Topher and me. A lot of work
goes in to a first time program and when you&#39;re meeting every day all
day with off hours student support there&#39;s not a lot of time for the
inevitable steering that comes with something new.
</p>
<p>
Now though we can sit back and enjoy some presentations by some great
teachers and provide some meaningful feedback. We&#39;ve got a nice list
of topics.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Blockchain
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Genetic Algorithms
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Data Mining
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Machine Learning
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Natural Language Processing
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Public Key Encryption
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Data Visualization
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Classic AI - Decision Trees
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Classic AI - search
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Databases / SQL
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Obviously we&#39;re not going to learn everything about topics like NLP or
ML but rather a single unit that can be done in a lass.
</p>
<p>
In the end, the idea is that every cohort member will have a nice set
of topics and support materials from which to choose for their classes.
</p>
<p>
Should be a lot of fun.
