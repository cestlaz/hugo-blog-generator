Looking forward to flying out to Phoenix for CSTA-2019 Saturday
morning. The conference doesn&#39;t officially start until Sunday, Monday
for me since I&#39;m not doing any of the pre-conference workshops. We&#39;ll
have most of Saturday as long as we&#39;re up to it, Sunday, and Monday
morning. Actually, there is the GitHub reception on <a href="https://csta-github-meetup.confetti.events/">Sunday evening</a> so
that&#39;s kind of official conference stuff.
</p>
<p>
As to the conference, I&#39;m super looking forward to it. To me CSTA is
 a people conference. SIGCSE by contrast is more of a sessions
conference. SIGCSE is bigger and less intimate. I have a great time
there catching up with friends from across the country and when my asocial
self manages, making new ones but for me it&#39;s more content/session
driven. There are always a bunch of sessions where I say to myself &#34;I
really should go to that.&#34;
</p>
<p>
CSTA is more intimate so it seems easier to meet and talk to new
people, even for asocial me. On the other hand, I find fewer &#34;must
see&#34; sessions. This makes sense though. I no longer
teach K12 and I had already designed and taught complete course
sequences going from beginner through college level before the first
CSTA conference.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t get me wrong. There are lots of great sessions. It&#39;s more that
many of the sessions I&#39;m interested in are more &#34;that looks cool&#34; or
&#34;interesting&#34; rather than, &#34;I really need to see that for what I&#39;m
doing or where I&#39;m at in my career.&#34;  Maybe it&#39;s just that it&#39;s really
hard for the sessions to match the value added from CSTA&#39;s &#34;hallway
track&#34; which I think is through the roof.
</p>
<p>
Here are the sessions I&#39;m zeroing in on:
</p>
<p>
On Monday, the &#34;Creativity in the K-12 Computing Classroom&#34; BOF looks
interesting so I&#39;ll probably try to hit it. On Saturday, I&#39;m curious
about the &#34;Advanced CS Concepts in High School: One Tool to Rule Them
All&#34; session. Based on the description, I&#39;m curious how much is about
advanced concepts and how much about tooling and resources that let
you get to interesting data and applications. The &#34;How to teach AI
across K-12&#34; session could also be interesting.
</p>
<p>
JonAlf and I will be doing our session on using GitHub in the next
block so I pretty much have to be there :-).  In the afternoon, I&#39;m
looking at the &#34;You can teach Machine Learning to HS students&#34; mostly
because I&#39;m curious as to how the presenter&#39;s thoughts on the subject
can add to what I&#39;ve done in my classes. Actually, that&#39;s also why I&#39;m
interested in the earlier AI session. I&#39;m also intrigued by Ed Campos&#39;
Bootstrap Data talk but I won&#39;t directly be going down that road in
any classes soon so have to prioritize. 
</p>
<p>
For the last block, I&#39;m intrigued by the Embroidery talk but Nifty
Assignments will probably win out.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t looked over Wednesday&#39;s schedule yet - I&#39;ll leave that for
Tuesday evening. 
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be going to most of these sessions, I&#39;ll probably
spend a good amount of time at the GitHub booth hopefully talking shop
with my fellow educators. 
</p>
<p>
Besides, when I&#39;m at the GitHub booth I also get to hang out with
Devorah (my wife). Did I mention, she&#39;s doing a very cool
<a href="http://blanketstatementproject.com/">knitting/crocheting for charity</a> project that you all should check out?
</p>
<p>
Hope to see all my old friends and meet many new ones in a few
days!!!!
