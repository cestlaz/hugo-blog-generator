As I sad in my <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2019-day8/">last post</a>, <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/8">day 8</a> would be a nice project or lesson in
an APCS-A or college CS1 class. Another nice problem would be to
write a program to generate an image in the format required by the
question. Alternatively, a teacher doing day 8 with their classes
might want to generate a bunch of images for the students to test
their decoders on. 
</p>
<p>
I thought I&#39;d write one to see how appropriate it would be for the
students. I tried to do it without anything fancy or advanced.
</p>
<p>
To start, you&#39;ll need a way to generate the block text for the
images. I found <a href="http://www.patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&amp;f=Banner3&amp;t=Hello">this</a> site and used the <strong>Banner3</strong> font. I generated
some text and saved it in a file. The important thing for our purposes
is that any space will count as white and any character as black.
</p>
<p>
The encoded image is a N * Width * Height sequence of digits  where
each Width * Height sequence of digits represents one layer. See the
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/8">problem text</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
You can follow along with the code <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/advent2019/blob/master/day08-generator.py">here</a>. 
</p>
<p>
So, here&#39;s how the program works:
</p>
<p>
The top 51 lines of the program consist of a routine which I&#39;ll
describe later and code to handle command line argument (to set the
number of layers).
</p>
<p>
Then, on line 55 I erad  in the file with the source image (from stdin). 
</p>
<p>
In line 57 through 63, I loop over the data and changed each non space
or newline to a star character. I really don&#39;t have to do this but I
wanted to see what the image looked like in just &#34;black and white.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Line 65 through 67 is where I split on the newlines. Now I could take
the length of any line to get the image width and the number of lines
the height.
</p>
<p>
70 through 79 creates a long list for the image. At each location, I
generate a list of values. Each list has one entry per layer. The
actual pixel value (1 or 0) is stored at a random location. Everything
before that is a random choice between the real color and transparent
and everything after is just random. Details for that step are in the
<code>genpixel</code> routine.
</p>
<p>
Finally, in 83 through 89 I loop over each layer and for each layer
the image and and output all the values into a single string. 
</p>
<p>
This is then output to stdout while the dimensions go to stderr.
</p>
<p>
If I had a source image in a file named &#34;hello.dat&#34; I&#39;d convert it to
source input for day 8 by typing <code>cat hello.dat | python3 day08-generator.py
-l 10 &gt; day08-input.dat</code>. This would create a 10 layer input.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s it. Once again, the code is all <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/advent2019/blob/master/day08-generator.py">here</a>. It would make for another
nice student assignment or for a teacher to prepare inputs for the
class.
</p>
<p>
Enjoy.
