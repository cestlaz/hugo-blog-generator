Yesterday we held our third monthly Professional Development session
for teachers of &#34;APCS-A, Similar, and Beyond.&#34; It&#39;s great to see that
we&#39;re starting to form a core of a community of CS teachers teaching
some of the more advanced classes as there is a core group that keeps
coming back for more. Even better is the fact that we&#39;re gaining a
couple of new teachers at each session.
</p>
<p>
Last time, we were at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>, a cloud provide that has been
very involved in education since their creation  and has been a
tremendous boon to my education projects over the years. 
</p>
<p>
This time we were hosted at <a href="https://events.withgoogle.com/grow-with-google-in-nyc/#content">Grow with Google</a>&#39;s new New York City
space. It&#39;s a great space on the first two floors of Google&#39;s main
building in Chelsea - 111 8th avenue. GWG looks like it will be a
terrific resource for New Yorkers with workshops ranging from coding,
resume writing, digital skills, and more. They also have offerings for
both kids and adults. 
</p>
<p>
They were also great hosts, providing a great room for us to run our
session as well as a nice dinner to keep the teachers fueled.
</p>
<p>
As usual, we had two major themes for our PD. First the pedagogy. My
former colleage Topher started with a pair programming workshop. 
</p>
<p>
&lt;figure class=&#34;z_image_center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/img/gwg-topher.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
</p>
<p>
Pair programming is a pretty common technique but it&#39;s deceptively
difficult to do well. It&#39;s not as simple as &#34;work in groups of two&#34;
and it can be a challenge to make sure both students are engaged and
progressing while using this practice.
</p>
<p>
Topher ran the group through a pair programming exercise and led a
discussion as to some of the strategies he uses and some of the
challenges he&#39;s face. I found it very helpful. Even small suggestions
like when he has each pair draw their &#34;team flag&#34; on a piece of paper
which they&#39;ll hold up if they want to ask for help. In the discussion
after the workshop I mentioned that I&#39;ve had more success with pair
programming when I relate it to a series of code review lessons I&#39;ve
been doing and that if people were interested I&#39;d talk about those
lessons at a future session.
</p>
<p>
Then we had dinner after which I did the content piece.
</p>
<p>
&lt;figure class=&#34;z_image_center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/img/gwg-z.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
</p>
<p>
We first look at a bit of <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a> for image procesing mostly so I
could introduce the participants to NetLogo since it&#39;s really an
underused, underappreciated environment. Then we talked a bit about
the APCS-A image lab. This led to the meat of the content piece. We
took a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NcIJXTlugc&amp;list=WL&amp;index=44&amp;t=0s">this video</a> on seam carving. When I first saw it, I was
blown away. Now it&#39;s an old technique but I&#39;m still blown away by how
it can be used as both motivation and a a platform to teach some
dynamic programming. We then did a brief overview behind the basic
ideas of dynamic programming and then developed the dynamic
programming algorith that&#39;s used in Seam Carving. I&#39;ll probably write
all of this up in more detail in a future post.
</p>
<p>
Overall it was a great event. We have one more PD scheduled for May
and then we&#39;ll start it up again in the Fall.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s great to have amazing partners like Google and Digital Ocean to
help support our CS teachers and I&#39;m looking forward to work with both
of them for years to come.
