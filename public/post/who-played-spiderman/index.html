I wasn&#39;t going to teach this lesson today. I was planning on starting
a multi day project starting with an exercise in specification writing
and design.
</p>
<p>
Beforehand though, we had to talk about classes. One of my students
asked if probability and/or statistics were really important for CS. I
started to cite a few examples and then decided to segue into
this. Normally, I do this as a couple of lessons which leads to a
project, we just did the first part. I might do it as a project with
my class later on.
</p>
<p>
I also submitted this as a &#34;Nifty Assignment&#34; for SIGCSE a couple of
years ago but it wasn&#39;t accepted. I was going to share the lesson at
some point so, well, here goes.
</p>
<p>
It starts with a question:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Who played Spiderman?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That&#39;s it. Every student writes down their answer. No talking, no
Googling or other searching, just write something down.
</p>
<p>
We then go around the room an tally up the answers. I got something
like this:
</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th class="align-right">Count</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Toby Maguire</td>
<td class="align-right">7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tom Holland</td>
<td class="align-right">6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew Garfield</td>
<td class="align-right">3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Peter Parker</td>
<td class="align-right">4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I don&#39;t know</td>
<td class="align-right">4</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
So as a class, we think that Toby MAguire played Spiderman with Tom
Holland also being a good choice. 
</p>
<p>
After painstakingly explaining that Peter Parker couldn&#39;t play
Spiderman because he <strong>IS</strong> Spiderman I also shared some of the more
interesting answers I&#39;ve gotten over the years.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve gotten &#34;the lady playing the song on the violin in the movie in
front of the subway&#34; which is technically correct and I also get
Willem Dafoe because as the Green Goblin / Norman Osborn he <strong>PLAYED</strong> Spiderman.
</p>
<p>
In any event, it appears that if we get a lot of data on who &#34;played
Spiderman&#34; it&#39;s likely that the most popular result is the right
answer or at least the right answer will be among the most popular
results. Of course, this is <a href="https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/common-knowledge/n9612">not always the case</a> but with reliable
data sources. 
</p>
<p>
So, the basic idea is that if we have a question to answer like &#34;Who
played spiderman?&#34; we can start by collecting a whole bunch of
documents from the web with terms like &#34;played Spiderman&#34; in them.
</p>
<p>
When I first taught this lesson, we used the Google API to search for
web pages with the search terms in them but more recently I&#39;ve used
the Bing API instead.
</p>
<p>
This leaves us with a large number of documents that could potentially
answer a search for &#34;who played Spiderman?&#34; 
</p>
<p>
We&#39;ll leave it at this for now. Next time, we&#39;ll talk about how we can
go from this collection of documents to a likely answer to our query. 
</p>
<p>
Tune in again tomorrow, same bat Time, same bat channel.
