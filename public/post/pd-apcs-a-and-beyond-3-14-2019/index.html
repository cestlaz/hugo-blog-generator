            <p>
Back in December we ran our first <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pd-apcs-a-and-beyond/">PD session for CS teachers</a>. This was
to address the need for professional development for teachers who were
more experienced in terms of computer science - we aimed this at people who were ready to
teach APCS-A, similar, or beyond and also to start to build a
community for these teachers. 
</p>
<p>
We had trouble setting things up for February but we&#39;re good to go for
March, April and May.
</p>
<p>
Just as with our first session, each session will consist of a content
piece, a pedagogy piece, and will overall be driven by the
participants.
</p>
<p>
The next session is set for Thursday, March 14 from 5:00 - 8:00 and
will be hosted by Digital Ocean. The sessions will earn you 3 CTLE
hours and dinner will be provided.
