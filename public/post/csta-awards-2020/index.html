I&#39;m guessing that pretty much everyone who stops by this blog knows
about the <a href="https://csteachers.org/">CSTA</a> (Computer Science Teacher&#39;s Association) and most of
you probably know about some awards they, well, award. Just in case, I
thought I&#39;d share.

<p>
Here are three awards, two of which are open for nominations /
applications now. If you know someone deserving, nominate them. I&#39;m
guessing students don&#39;t really know about the Cutler-Bell award so if
you have any deserving students, please share the info with them.
