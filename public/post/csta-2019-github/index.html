With ISTE ending, the next big event for CS treachers is the annual
<a href="https://www.csteachers.org/page/2019conference">CSTA Conference</a>. I first attended two years ago in Baltimore. Last
year the conference, in Omaha was bigger and better in every way
imaginable. I expect this year to be the best yet.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t go to a lot of conferences so I don&#39;t have much to compare
CSTA with but I like the fact that it&#39;s is about half the size of
SIGCSE. At about 1000 attendees it still feels small enough to be
intimate but at the same time large enough so that there&#39;s something
for everyone and plenty of people to learn and share from and with.
</p>
<p>
Just like last year, I&#39;ll be spending a lot of time at the GitHub
booth so if you want to talk about how to use GitHub to support your
students make sure to stop by and say hello.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll also be giving a session with my long time partner in crime
JonAlf. 
</p>
<p>
Most of us know that Git is a version control system and that
GitHub is pretty much the industry standard platform for using
Git. Many of us also know that GitHub for Education has a great
toolset to support using GitHub with your classes. Tools that help
organize, distribute, collect, and assess assignments.
</p>
<p>
Fewer people know that GitHub can be used to really easily create a
web presence and as a way to distribute class material and you don&#39;t
even have to use the command line if you don&#39;t want to. I use GitHub
as a lightweight CMS with my classes, to host full blown web sites,
and also to host this blog.
</p>
<p>
Come join JonAlf and me on Tuesday at 11:15 in West 106C and we&#39;ll
show you how you can use GitHub as a web presence as well.
</p>
<p>
I also want to briefly mention that my better half, Devorah, is going
to be with us at the GitHub booth running a really cool
knitting/crocheting for  charity project (thanks to both CSTA and
GitHub for facilitating this). I&#39;ll write more about it in a day or so
but if you&#39;re going to be at CSTA2019 and you knit or crochet or want
to learn, you can check the project out here:
<a href="http://blanketstatementproject.com/"><a href="http://blanketstatementproject.com/">http://blanketstatementproject.com/</a></a> (note that the site is hosted on
GitHub and the source is <a href="https://github.com/blanketstatementproject/blanketstatementproject.github.io">here</a>). 
</p>
<p>
GitHub is also holding a pre-conference reception on July 7 from
5:30 - 8:00. You can sign up <a href="https://csta-github-meetup.confetti.events/">here</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Hope to see many of you in a couple of weeks in Phoenix.
