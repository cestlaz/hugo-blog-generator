Presenting at CSTA 2020
</h2>
<p>
I noticed a few tweets and posts from people announcing that they&#39;d be
presenting at CSTA2020 - the big computer science teachers conference
held every July.
</p>
<p>
A common thread in a few of these were trepidation&#39;s
presenters. Excited to be doing this but nervous.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s interesting that teachers, myself included, sometimes get nervous
before presentations even though we present every day as part of our
jobs. I know it&#39;s different as we have the same kids every day but
even day 1 jitters each semester aren&#39;t the same as the presentation
anxiety that some of us face.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m certainly not a super master seasoned presenter. I&#39;ve done it a
few times at CSTA and other venues and this year JonAlf and I will be
running a GitHub workshop but I thought I&#39;d share some words of
encouragement anyway.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-2">
You&#39;re really just talking shop.
</h3>
<p>
Basically, you&#39;re a teacher talking about teaching and I think we all
love to do that. 
</p>
<h3 id="headline-3">
It&#39;s an audience of friends
</h3>
<p>
CSTA is a conference primarily of teachers - our colleague.s Everyone
coming to your session is already interested in your opinion and going
in as a supportive audience. They <strong>want</strong> to hear from you.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll go back to the previous point - you&#39;re basically talking shop
with friends. 
</p>
<h3 id="headline-4">
CSTA still feels intimate
</h3>
<p>
In spite of its rapid growth, the CSTA conference still feels
intimate. It&#39;s not a huge conference where you can attend a talk or
meet someone at breakfast and never find them again. It&#39;s big enough
so that you <strong>can</strong> avoid anyone you want to dodge but you can pretty
much find time to spend with anyone you want to as well. This can turn
your talk more into a starting point for a longer convesation - how
cool is that.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-5">
Don&#39;t forget to enjoy it
</h3>
<p>
I used  to get really nervous when giving LARGE talks - we&#39;re talking
to an audience of one or two thousand. I&#39;ve only done that a few
times. A couple of times at the New York Tech Meetup and once when I
was the faculty graduation speaker at Stuy when my best friend was the
guest speaker and my daughter was in the graduating class. 
</p>
<p>
I was pretty nervous before I hit the stage at Stuy when a colleague
gave me some great advice - &#34;take the time to enjoy the moment.&#34; I
remembered that just as I said above - I was about to talk to
friends. Two thousand of them, but friends nonetheless. I was reminded
to slow down and take it in. Enjoy the moment. I&#39;ve tried to do that
with any presentation I&#39;ve given since. 
</p>
<h3 id="headline-6">
Final thoughts
</h3>
<p>
As  a final thought I&#39;ll leave you by paraphrasing something that I
think was said by Pinchas Zuckerman - the world class violist and
violinist (who I think also used to wear a shirt proclaiming &#34;I
vibrato when I play baroque - Deal with it!!!!!).
</p>
<p>
He said that you should always be smiling when you&#39;re
performing. Either your performance is going well and you&#39;re creating
beautiful music or it&#39;s going horribly but it will be over soon. :-)
</p>
<p>
Already looking forward to July.
