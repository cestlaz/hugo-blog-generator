      <title>Scared teachers can&#39;t teach and scared students won&#39;t learn</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/scared-teachers-scared-students/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been reading a lot of takes on NYC schools reopening. We&amp;#39;ve had
daily conversations about it with our summer teachers but
conversations abound on Facebook, Twitter and everywhere else.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many salient points have been raised - given the DOE&amp;#39;s track record,
can they make things safe and will they? Can they be trusted? Given
that any policy needs all players to follow the rules - students,
teachers, and staff how can that ever happen? What happens when a
parent want&amp;#39;s their kid in school but wants to opt out of wearing a
mask? What happens if kids just straight out refuse? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then there&amp;#39;s logistics and teacher workload - even if you have fewer
kids in school there will still be far too many on subway platforms
and who knows if they&amp;#39;ll be masked outside of the school
building. What about bathrooms and class changeovers? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then there&amp;#39;s that little matter of teachers having to now, instead of
just five classes which is already too many could effectively be asked
to teach double or more - the result of splitting their classes into
live and remote. There&amp;#39;s also the way they want the live teaching to
work which basically reduces the in person instruction to a remote
experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What isn&amp;#39;t being talked about is discomfort and fear. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From what I can tell, a lot of teachers are afraid for their
health. Not mildly concerned, afraid. I don&amp;#39;t blame them. I would be
too. I&amp;#39;m betting a lot of students are also afraid of going back.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How effective is a teacher going to be when they feel that any
interaction or even too much time in the wrong space might get them
sick or worse. Same for students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After 9/11 we relocated to Brooklyn Tech. It was surreal
and weird but it felt fine. I taught, they learned. We were pushed
back to Stuy too early. You could still smell the smoke from the
smoldering wreckage of ground zero and there were concerns about the
air quality. It was on a lot of our minds all the time we were down on
Chambers street. It was certainly on my mind. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know that I wasn&amp;#39;t teaching at anything resembling my normal level
and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure the kids weren&amp;#39;t learning nearly as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Eventually, the smoke cleared, they cleaned the building again (and
stole a lot of valuables) and set up sensors that at least seemed more
accurate and after a period of time we felt normal or at least close
enough.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, that was from a single event not an ongoing pandemic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t believe for one second that NYC schools will be safe for
teachers and students in the fall but even if they were, if teachers
and students don&amp;#39;t feel safe, student learning will suffer. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I get that there are downsides to staying remote but don&amp;#39;t fool
yourself into believing that just because you&amp;#39;re sending your kid to
school they&amp;#39;ll be socializing and doing all that good in person
stuff. They&amp;#39;ll be sitting in rows watching a projector and then
shuffled home.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sure, remote is not as good as normal in person classes but don&amp;#39;t
blame teachers, blame the pandemic. These are exceptional times and
bad and unsafe  in person &amp;#34;solutions&amp;#34; are much worse than safety of
remote. At the end of the day, this pandemic will pass and we will get
back to in person. So what if a for a year students don&amp;#39;t reach some
arbitrary standard bar because remote is sub-optimal. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if safe, scared teachers can&amp;#39;t teach and scared students won&amp;#39;t
learn.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PSA on CSTA (NYC)</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/psa-for-csta/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Just a quick public service announcemnt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Up until now CSTA-NYC has been using Meetup to organize and advertise
events but now they&amp;#39;re moving over to using the CSTA site as their
platform. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re a CS teacher you should be a part of CSTA. There&amp;#39;s both a
free tier and a plus tier which costs $50 a year.  I&amp;#39;ve been a plus
member since that level became available. If you&amp;#39;re a NYC teacher, you
should join the CSTA NYC chapter. If you&amp;#39;re already coming to CSTA-NYC
events, you should still go to the CSTA web site and check to make
sure you&amp;#39;re part of the NYC chapter so that you don&amp;#39;t miss any
exciting announcements or events. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Supporting Our Students</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/supporting-our-students/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2020 12:22:26 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/supporting-our-students/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Austin Cory Bart put together a great &lt;a href=&#34;https://acbart.github.io//2020/06/10/race-in-cs1/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about supporting Black
students in CS1. Cory asked about this on the SIGCSE mailing list and
in his post he both breaks things down and shares all the resources
that he compiled from the ensuing discussion. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s a lot of good stuff both in the post and in the links but
there&amp;#39;s a lot to get lost in. As teachers we can sometimes affect
change at a department or school level but we can always make a
difference in our classes and with our students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I titled this post &amp;#34;Supporting Our Students&amp;#34; and not &amp;#34;Supporting Black
Students.&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;m certainly &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; pulling any all lives matter BS but
rather reflecting back on something that shaped my approach with my
students and started to open my eyes and that specific experience for
me was an all students experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I cut my teach at Seward Park High School down on the Lower East
Side. It was a high poverty school and a very diverse one. I had
top flight honors students, criminal thugs, druggies, sweet kids whom
the system failed and everything else you can imagine. The main groups
were classified back then as Chinese and Hispanic and then Black then
White but within those groups there were subdivisions. Shortly before
I got the gig the school had brokered an in school truce between the
factions of Chinese gangs and while the term of the day was
Hispanic the students were from a variety of places.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One day I was talking to a guidance counselor in the hall. We didn&amp;#39;t
know each other - I shanghaied her in another conversation - I had
something to ask. She said &amp;#34;wait - you&amp;#39;re Zamansky right?&amp;#34; Yep. &amp;#34;I was
wondering who you were, all the students want to be in your class.&amp;#34; I
was confused. I wasn&amp;#39;t super popular - I was just in about a year and
a half. I also wasn&amp;#39;t so good. I&amp;#39;d rate myself as an above average
very raw young teacher but that&amp;#39;s about it. She explained that I was
one of the only teachers where students from all the population groups
wanted to be in my class. The Hispanic students, for instance all
wanted to be in Pablo Chang&amp;#39;s math class, the Chinese in another
teachers but apparently I appealed to everyone equally. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started to think about why that might be the case and it got me
thinking about what I had learned in my short time teaching. Prior to
teaching I led a pretty sheltered life. I went to public school up
until college and had a pretty diverse group of friends but as a kid
you can be pretty oblivious to economic and race related
differences. As an adult I went to a private college, NYU, and started off
at Goldman Sachs. Not exactly a recipe for awareness. I quickly
realized that not all kids learned the same, thought the same and
going further, lived the same.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It taught me that it&amp;#39;s not merely about talking to your students, it&amp;#39;s
about listening to them. Given time and the chance, they&amp;#39;ll open up
and you&amp;#39;ll learn about their challenges. When it seems there giving
you a song and dance, don&amp;#39;t assume they&amp;#39;re trying to pull a fast
one. Give them the benefit of the doubt. You&amp;#39;ll get burned now and
again by a kid taking advantage but things have a way of coming clean
and if you don&amp;#39;t give the kid the benefit of the doubt you can
irreparably harm your relationship. Trust is key in
education.  Besides I&amp;#39;ve been burned way more by giving the benefit of
the doubt to people professionally than as a teacher and at the end of
the day I&amp;#39;d rather lose sleep angry over being taken advantage of than
lose sleep feeling guilty for damaging my relationship with a student
for the wrong reasons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you treat your students like people - young people but  people
nonetheless and earnestly listen and try to learn from them and learn
about them that&amp;#39;s your guide. I&amp;#39;m not saying I&amp;#39;m particularly good at
helping my kids - I&amp;#39;m your stereotypical socially awkward computer
geek but the more I listened the more I understood the individual
issues my students had to deal with. My Black students, my immigrant
students, my poor students and all the rest. Sure there were common
themes but every one has a unique story.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While we teach our assorted subjects to our students really at the end
of the day more so than teaching any specific computer science I hope
to be a force for good in their lives and their development as
people. The best way I can do that is to listen, try to learn, try to
understand and then try to help and support.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teachers and Police</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-police/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2020 10:56:52 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-police/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Teachers and Police 
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s been an ugly few days but perhaps in some ways a hopeful few as
people have been making their voices heard like never before in my
lifetime. We&amp;#39;ve seen and endless stream of videos of peaceful protest
and far too many instances of police officers overstepping their
bounds. I keep hearing about violent protesters but those videos seem
to be avoiding my feeds as are the videos of law enforcement going
after the looters who are a separate group from the protestors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not comfortable getting on a soapbox about race relations in this
country. I want and strive to be an ally but I think my place is to
listen and support not dictate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even so, we keep hearing about police accountability on one side that
they need their protections on the other. I thought I&amp;#39;d look at that
and compare the job of a police officer to that of a teacher. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
My experience
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the one side, I&amp;#39;ve been a teacher for close to 30 years. On the
police side? I&amp;#39;ve never been a cop but I was an auxiliary cop for a
while. I stopped soon after I went in to teaching. I was able to do it
while on Wall Street but teaching is just so much harder and more
draining that I didn&amp;#39;t have the energy. As an auxiliary cop I got a
bit of an inside view. I didn&amp;#39;t patrol the bad parts of the precinct
much - Manhattan Valley,  but I did a bit. I also got to interact with
the police and was listening to police radio during my tours so knew
what was or wasn&amp;#39;t going on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
Key Requirements
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
Police
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sixty college credits or military experience, pass a written and
physical test, psychological test and then the Police Academy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-5&#34;&gt;
Teachers
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Masters degree, standardized tests, student teaching although the
quality ranges from rigorous preparation to fly by night TFA nonsense.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-6&#34;&gt;
Perceptions
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-7&#34;&gt;
Police
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the one side you have police as heroes. This is probably to an
extend residual from 9/11 grouping them in with firefighters and
EMT. You&amp;#39;ll also hear that they face death every day and if there
weren&amp;#39;t protections like qualified immunity you&amp;#39;d never have anyone
sign up for the job. We also keep hearing that the &amp;#34;majority are good
cops&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;only a few bad apples.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other side, ACAB.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-8&#34;&gt;
Teachers
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the one hand you&amp;#39;ll hear we&amp;#39;re the backbone of society and should
be paid more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other, we&amp;#39;re glorified babysitters who do nothing for pay and
pension. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-9&#34;&gt;
Reality 
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This post isn&amp;#39;t really about teaching so I&amp;#39;m not going to dwell on
that side other than as a comparison but education going remote has,
if nothing else, proven that teachers are anything but lazy
goodfornothings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the police side, video evidence shows that a few bad apples do
indeed spoil the bunch and when both police commissioners and police
union chiefs and even mayors repeatedly lie, distort and omit you know
we need some real changes. I keep hearing about the police needing to
maintain order and acting reasonably but with all those body cameras
plus police officers specifically at protests to film and document I
haven&amp;#39;t seen anything backing the police line. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As to the police facing death every day? Yes, there&amp;#39;s always the
possibility of a bad encounter but in my time with the auxiliary I
can&amp;#39;t ever remember hearing a call for &amp;#34;officer needs assistance&amp;#34; nor
vary many intense situations. Most of the job was being in the
community. In fact, it turns out that most police officers go through
their entire careers &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/08/a-closer-look-at-police-officers-who-have-fired-their-weapon-on-duty/&#34;&gt;never firing their weapon&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the same time, teachers in many schools face violence or the threat
of violence and are under no circumstances allowed to even touch a
student. We are supposed to deescalate. Is there a reason why police
can&amp;#39;t do the same? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-10&#34;&gt;
On reform
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some people are calling for more training but I&amp;#39;m not one of
them. I&amp;#39;ve had corprorate, teacher, and city training. It&amp;#39;s all CYA
garbage. It doesn&amp;#39;t change behavior. Eric Garner was choked
in 2014. Chokeholds were banned by the NYPD in, I think around 1993
and you can bet that was in the &amp;#34;training&amp;#34; officers received. Training
reminds good people how to act. Training helps give you a tool if
you&amp;#39;re inclined to use it. Hire a thug and no training is going
to make them an angel. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m more on the defund side but that doesn&amp;#39;t just mean cut the
budget. Here are a few things I&amp;#39;d like to see:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Beat cops - this is something that David Dinkins did with
Commissioner Brown and they never get credit. They took the cop out
of the car and put them on the beat. On foot. Make them part of the
community they&amp;#39;re policing. Once they went back into the cars they
were out of the communities. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Better accountability - when the next contract comes around we need
our politicians to take a &lt;strong&gt;hard&lt;/strong&gt; line on accountability. Things like
community review boards, penalties for turned off cameras,
transparent records on police misconduct. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Make police accountable for bad behavior - while police need due
process, in the rare times there&amp;#39;s any accountability it&amp;#39;s usually
in terms of a payout to the public. This doesn&amp;#39;t affect the police
because it&amp;#39;s paid by the taxpayer. Let&amp;#39;s change that. The city
contributes to police pensions. Let&amp;#39;s reduce that as needed to pay
for settlements. If not, how about start with the police salary
scale and adjust it annually to pay for settlements. Make those
responsible feel it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The sad thing is that unless the protests continue there might not be
change. I fear that we&amp;#39;ll get a few speeches and some surface changes
when we need fundamental change. The solutions aren&amp;#39;t hard but we
need people in power who will actually implement them. de Blasio came
to office claiming to be a progressive but he caved to the police
force at the first signs of resistance. We need to put up candidate
who will actually represent the people and make changes and then we
actually have to get out and vote them in.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Before condemning try walking in their shoes</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/privilege/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Jun 2020 19:20:55 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/privilege/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve got some CS Ed stuff I want to write but can&amp;#39;t bring myself to
writing about it today. I rarely post outside of my wheelhouse - CS,
Education and the intersection of the two.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t really think I&amp;#39;m qualified to say much about the current
crisis. The out of control police, racism, class warfare, a failed
government not only at the federal level but also in New York city and
state but maybe I can share something worthwhile from my narrow
experiences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been seeing too many posts and tweets about the protests
condemning any rioting. I&amp;#39;ve never promoted violence but still I
thought I might have something to say.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The important background piece is that for those of us who are white
and who grew up with some level if privilege, it&amp;#39;s hard for us to
really understand the what oppressed people suffer.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started life in a somewhat well to do family, I attended private
school through first grade, then my parents pulled me and my
siblings out for public school - somethingn for which I&amp;#39;m now
grateful. Shortly after, my dad got sick, lost his job and later passed
away. That left my mom raising 3 kids on a teachers salary. On the one
hand we had the apartment, on the other I wore hand-me-downs. I worked
my way through school and payed &amp;#34;rent&amp;#34; living at home not because I
wanted to but because we needed me to. So, we weren&amp;#39;t well to do but
although I didn&amp;#39;t realize it at the time, I possessed great privilege
both in terms of my skin color and also in terms of what my mom was
willing and more importantly able to sacrifice of herself for her
children. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I got older my schools, though public were less reflective of
society. Populations were pretty diverse but I was brought up in
something of an intellectual bubble and under the belief it was a
meritocracy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After school and a stint on Wall street, I went to teach at Seward
Park. What an awakening. It was my first exposure to kids and families
living under far harsher circumstances than I. When I was a kid I
volunteered at a soup kitchen. I couldn&amp;#39;t reconcile the family that on
the one hand had to come to the kitchen for food while the family all
wore really expensive sneakers (I was wearing the $10 Alexander&amp;#39;s
special). As I got more exposed to &amp;#34;how the other half lived&amp;#34; I
learned that it was more complex. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I went into teaching on a whim, as my career progressed I
realized more and more how important public education was and the job
became more of a mission. At the same time, as I learned more and more
about the populations that I tried to serve so that I could support them
and try to really know their circumstances. I realized that it&amp;#39;s really
hard to &amp;#34;get it.&amp;#34; I also realized that the more removed you are, the
higher up you are on the ladder, the harder it is. That&amp;#39;s not to say
that there aren&amp;#39;t many well to do people with huge hearts trying to
and doing good it&amp;#39;s just that I feel that the further you are from the
ground floor the harder it is to really understand the issues that the
ground floor people have to live with.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, this brings us back to the protests and the rioting. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Separating out the protesters and rioters we really have 4 types of
rioters:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Criminals - people who are going to riot and loot whenever the
opportunity presents itself. Remember Philly after the Eagles won
the Superbowl?  These people are just criminals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Riots resulting from police instigators - well, we should condemn
the police and not their victims and we&amp;#39;ve seen a bunch of video
evidence of this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Riots resulting from white agitatos - same as the previous point. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Riots from within the protest group.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That last group - group 4 are the only ones who are part of the
protest groups but let&amp;#39;s not be so fast to condemn them. It&amp;#39;s easy for
those of us of privilege to point fingers and say &amp;#34;shame on you,
protest peacefully&amp;#34; but where has that gotten them? We were talking
about this earlier and I was trying to remember an earlier victim of
police brutality. I was thinking of Rodney King 20 years ago but was
blanking on the name. Devorah rattled off names walking back the
years. Two decades, countless abuses and nothing changed with
peaceful protest. There comes a time when you feel you&amp;#39;re out of
options. It&amp;#39;s easy for us to point and condemn but very hard to
understand. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Am I promoting violence? No. I feel bad about innocents hurt and small
business owners who&amp;#39;s property has been damaged but what about the
lives that have been lost or destroyed due to police abuse and
government inaction and in fact government support?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are solutions. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joincampaignzero.org/#vision&#34;&gt;Campaign Zero&lt;/a&gt; has a lot of info on how to reform
policing. We also have to fully fund schools and actually deal with
poverty rather than make it a crime.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t have any inspirational message here or any real answers. The
work goes on. I&amp;#39;ll continue my work in public education try to support
my students and understand them and their challenges more and more and
try to be a better ally to those less privileged than I. 
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Covid-19 Journey (so far)</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/covid/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2020 07:59:23 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/covid/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I haven&amp;#39;t been posting much over the past couple of weeks and that&amp;#39;s
partly because we&amp;#39;ve been under the weather.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yep - Covid-19. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First things first - we&amp;#39;re all either recovered or well on the way. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I thought I&amp;#39;d write up our experience as it might be useful for
others who are going through similar. This disease is weird and seems
to affect people differently but three of us followed a similar path.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In terms of our current status, I&amp;#39;ve been symptom free for a few
days. My sense of smell hasn&amp;#39;t fully returned but it&amp;#39;s starting to and
I&amp;#39;ve been fever free for around two weeks. I&amp;#39;ve been using a pulse
oximeter  and that&amp;#39;s been reading normal. I still feel a bit off in
the evenings, haven&amp;#39;t been sleeping well and get a bit of a headache
but I think that&amp;#39;s mostly my inner hypochondriac and the headaches
from the poor sleep. Besides, the headaches feel different than when I
was having symptoms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Batya and Devorah have been clear for a week longer than I&amp;#39;ve been and
Natan hasn&amp;#39;t yet shown any symptoms so hopefully he got it, built some
antibodies and is done.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Batya got it first then Devorah then me. The symptoms were largely the
same. As they say - flu like. Fever, chills, low energy, head or chest
congestion and loss of smell and taste. I never fully lost my taste
(but then nobody would accuse me of having good taste anyway) but it
did dull. Batya and I also got headaches. They were a little weird -
kindof between a regular headache and a migraine. We never had bad
coughs, just occasional ones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The actual fever/chills part lasted for about 3 or 4 days each. Never
got as bad as a bad case of the flu and we never felt we had to rush
to the emergency room but we all essentially took some days off for
work. For me, it was mostly being lucky - my class days and important
meetings fell outside my sick zone and I was able to focus enough to
do the planning I had to albeit not optimally.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We never relapsed but recovery was slow. After the fever passed, we
all went through the &amp;#34;I think I&amp;#39;m feeling better&amp;#34; stage where we still
had some congestion and were feeling &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; but we seemed to go in the
right direction. This seemed to last forever but at least for me, one
day a few days ago, I finally woke up feeling pretty good. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By all counts we&amp;#39;ve been lucky. Hopefully we&amp;#39;ll have some level of
immunity - we&amp;#39;re going to try to get antibody testing to see if we can
give plasma. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the things to watch out for if you do got through this is the
lethargy. I&amp;#39;ve been in a funk for most of the past month. I guess that&amp;#39;s
because of the difficulty in sustaining focus when actually sick and
the stress even when you&amp;#39;re feeling okay. Over this past weekend
when I was finally able to restart a number of projects is what&amp;#39;s
making me feel I&amp;#39;m really out of the woods. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, that&amp;#39;s been our Covid-19 journey. I hope posting this provides
another data point for people - what it&amp;#39;s like for those of us who are
getting it but have been lucky so as not to get it so bad. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hoping you&amp;#39;re all staying safe and healthy.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Email or USPS</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/email-or-usps/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2020 14:00:41 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/email-or-usps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
USPS is in financial trouble. That&amp;#39;s been pretty well documented
recently. Most reasonable people will recognize that the USPS is both
an important service and while it receives no taxpayer support would
be profitable were it not for the GOP imposing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.truthorfiction.com/is-usps-losing-money-because-of-a-2006-pension-law/&#34;&gt;unfair and unrealistic
pension funding requirements&lt;/a&gt; in 2006.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although I&amp;#39;m an ardent supporter of the post office and feel that
privatization of such an important intuition would be criminal today I
want to talk about some small repercussions of so many things going to
email rather than snail mail. Small in the greater sense but maybe
pretty big to the people affected.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back in the old days college acceptances went out via old fashioned
paper mail. It took a bit of time but it was super reliable no matter
where you lived. Nowadays I&amp;#39;m pretty sure college acceptances are
still sent out via USPS but you can also find out online. That&amp;#39;s
terrific. The potential issue comes up for opportunities that are only
announced via email. This is the case for my program and also for a
number of other college and university honors program that I&amp;#39;m aware
of. Part of this is certainly due to timing as the window from getting
applications to confirming participation is very small but it&amp;#39;s still
unfortunate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This past year, I&amp;#39;ve had a few cases of bad email addresses. For one
reason or another I had to reach out to a candidate only to get the
email bounced back. This isn&amp;#39;t really horrible as I&amp;#39;ve always been
able to hunt down a correct address either through Hunter or through
my friends teaching at the high schools. The real problem is that
students don&amp;#39;t always read or see all their emails. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I had a student who applied for my program with an active email but
their high school school somehow sent over to Hunter one that the student didn&amp;#39;t
use. Had I not caught it by chance that student who&amp;#39;s now with us and
doing great wouldn&amp;#39;t be. In another case I was talking to a student
who by chance new another student who we offered a seat but never took
it. It came up in conversation that this kid was very unhappy at the
college they ended up going to. I asked why they didn&amp;#39;t take our offer
to be in the Daedalus program. We later found out that the student
never saw the offer. It either went to a non-used address or a SPAM
filter or was just buried in the inbox. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a problem. Not so much for those of us running these
programs - we&amp;#39;re going to fill with qualified, deserving
students. Rather for qualified and deserving students who miss out on
the chance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When something goes out via USPS we can be fairly certain it will at
some point in the near future be in the hands of the intended
recipient. USPS is really good at that. With email, we can&amp;#39;t always be
sure.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday was the start of Passover and like many others we weren&amp;#39;t
able to physically gather with friends and family to
celebrate. Since the Talmud, unlike the NYC Dept of Education, doesn&amp;#39;t
seem to ban Zoom, like many others, we used Zoom to connect with
family.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tonight we&amp;#39;ll do it again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the meantime, I thought I&amp;#39;d share this small bit of research Natan
did a couple of years ago on a traditional part of the seder: &lt;a href=&#34;http://seccorecit.blogspot.com/2018/04/a-historically-informed-echad-mi-yodea.html&#34;&gt;A
Historically Informed Echad Mi Yodea&lt;/a&gt;

Enjoy

      <title>Brazilian Carrot Cake</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/carrot-cake/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Mar 2020 15:55:03 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/carrot-cake/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;figure class=&amp;#34;z_image_center&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;img src=&amp;#34;/img/carrot-cake.jpg&amp;#34;/&amp;gt; 
&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not my normal post but these are not normal times. Besides, this isn&amp;#39;t
the first &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2010-05-02-flatbreads.html/&#34;&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#39;ve posted. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m one of those that will, as long as supplies allow, bake and cook
my way through our shelter in. Today I made Brazilian carrot
cake. It&amp;#39;s not quite the same as an American carrot cake as you&amp;#39;ll see
from the recipe below. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, carrot cake rules:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Obviously since it contains carrot which is a vegetable, it&amp;#39;s healthy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you don&amp;#39;t ice it and serve it before evening, it&amp;#39;s carrot bread and
therefore a healthy option for breakfast, brunch, or snack.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Only when you add the frosting or icing does it become carrot cake and
hence dessert. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This recipe is the family recipe of one of my daughter&amp;#39;s coworkers. I
can only imagine it&amp;#39;s from some Brazilian grandmother and hence the
measurement of &amp;#34;3 large carrots.&amp;#34; It makes me think of recipes that
I&amp;#39;d get from bubbe or my mothers bubbe - &amp;#34;add 2 cups of sugar.&amp;#34; Of
course she was talking about 2 empty yartzeit glasses of sugar. I have
a relative who followed around here grandmother an before she added
any ingredient for a recipe put it in a standard measure to 
convert the recipe to something that we could make sense of today.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Okay, now on to the recipe:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Ingredients
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Cake
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
3 carrots, peeled and sliced)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
3 eggs (large)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1 cup oil
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
2 cups sugar
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
2 cups flour
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1 tablespoon baking powder
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
Brigadeiro sauce
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1 can sweetened condensed milk
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1 tablespoon butter
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
4 tablespoons of cocoa (or use some other chocolate and melt it in)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
Buttermilk Glaze
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I sometimes use this instead of the brigadeiro sauce
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
2/3 cups buttermilk
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1 to 2 cups powdered sugar
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-5&#34;&gt;
Directions
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-6&#34;&gt;
Cake
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Preheat oven to 350
Prepare pan (I line the bottom with parchment and grease)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mix sugar, flour, baking powder in a bowl
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Blend carrots in a blender
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Add oil and eggs to blender and blend all together
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fold carrot mixture into dry ingredients
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
pour into prepared pan
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
bake for ~40 mintues
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-7&#34;&gt;
Bigadeiro sauce (if using) 
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
combine all ingredients in saucepan
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
cook, stirring until thickened (about 10 minutes) 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You&amp;#39;ll know it&amp;#39;s thick enough when you drag your spoon across the
pan and you can see the bottom. It will thicken up considerably when
it cools so better if it&amp;#39;s looser rather than thicker.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
spread on cake while warm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-8&#34;&gt;
Buttermilk glaze (if using)
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
whisk together glaze ingredients until smooth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
poke holes all over cake with a fork or knife
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
pour / spread glaze on cake
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Career Directions - how a sad day changed mine</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/career-directions/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2020 14:39:29 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/career-directions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I was talking to a friend yesterday who had just started doing grad
work in school leadership. It got me thinking about my original career
plans and how you never know where you&amp;#39;re going to end up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Well, not my original original career plans. When I started on Wall
Street I had no idea what the future would bring. For all I knew, I
could have been a career professional programmer or even gone over to
the business side.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I started teaching, it was as a math teacher and back then, I
thought that if I were to do it for my career, it would probably be in
math with maybe a smattering of CS. I had reached out to DOE once
about a greater role for CS but this was in the very early 90s and was
summarily dismissed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What changed?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was September 1996. I had graduated my first class of CS students
having taught 4 sections of APCS-AB and one of Comptuer Graphics - a course I
created to get out of teaching Geometry. I had just started the
Systems course and given the culture of the school and the trends of
the times it looked like I&amp;#39;d be able to teach all CS for the
foreseeable future if I so desired.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My friend and mentor Richie Rothenberg was the math chair. Richie, or
Doc as we sometimes called him started to talk to me about succession
plans. Richie was going to turn 50 that spring. In five years he&amp;#39;d
both hit retirement and his kids would be done with college. The plan
was to groom me as his replacement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sounded like a good idea. I enrolled in Hunter&amp;#39;s school leadership
certificate program and we were on our way. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Early that spring, Richie called me in to his office and told me that
CS enrollment had skyrocketed. He was my boss but wanted to know if he
could be the other CS teacher, shadow me and follow my lead as the CS
guy. I was super psyched for this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If things went to plan, Richie and I would have split CS for the next
few years while I took on a larger administrative roll and then when
Richie retired, I&amp;#39;d take the reigns. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If that happened I probably wouldn&amp;#39;t have pushed for more CS and
history or at least my history would have been very different. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What happened?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
May 15 1997. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Richie, on his 50th birthday, driving home, suffered a heart attack,
crashed his car and passed away.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was devastating. For me and for the school. I wrote a bit about
more about Richie &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2012-05-09-my-favorite-year-teacher.html/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-11-07-rich-rich.html/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t yet have my license and in any event wasn&amp;#39;t ready. The
principal chose Danny Jaye, another great friend and mentor for the
position. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that up until then Danny had no real desire
to be department chair. He seemed happy ruling over his math reserach
domain and working int he dean&amp;#39;s office.  Danny would adopt the
moniker &amp;#34;doc&amp;#34; but we&amp;#39;d also refer to him as &amp;#34;The Maestro.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would finish getting my supervisors certificate but would never use
it and ended up forging what has been my path in the CS Ed
space. Danny would not only take Stuy&amp;#39;s math department to new places
but also led revolutionary work in NY City and State in terms of math
education and their math teams.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Had that tragedy not occurred on May 1997, for better or worse I
probably never get involved in the greater CS Ed movement and only a
select few at Stuy end up benefiting from Danny&amp;#39;s work (and Danny, as
a side note is an amazing teacher - back in the day, he got my brother
Steve to both understand calculus and enjoy calc class).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Talking to JoAnn had me reminiscing about all of this. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I still miss Richie and  tear up when I think about him but that is
the past. That event was horrific for Richie, his family and friends
but also changed a number of life trajectories. Funny how that works.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been reading some prediction posts this morning on blogs and
social media. Big national and world level stuff. I&amp;#39;ve never been much
for predictions so I thought I&amp;#39;d share some more local and personal
things I&amp;#39;m looking forward to in the coming year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First a couple of big ones. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m just about to complete my fourth year at Hunter. Time really does
fly. It&amp;#39;s been a long road but late in 2019 NY State finally approved
our CS Teacher Certification programs!!!!  That&amp;#39;s big news. Some day
I&amp;#39;ll go into the frustrations and ridiculousness that caused a year
plus delay but now that&amp;#39;s all in the past and we&amp;#39;re good to go. We&amp;#39;ve
got a Masters program for aspiring teachers and a certificate program
for teachers who are already licensed in another subject area.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The plan is to run a summer intensive in July and have our first
cohort through the program by the end of 2020. We have a real
opportunity here to get ahead of things and build a group of certified
master CS teachers in and for NYC. This can be relly big and is very
exciting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other big thing for me has to do with the other big initiative I
started at Hunter - the Daedalus CS Scholars program. The program has
been growing each year both in terms of students and in terms of
programs and student opportunities. The exciting thing for me is that
we&amp;#39;re about to have our first graduates. The Daedalus program didn&amp;#39;t
exist four years ago and now it&amp;#39;s a big part of Hunter CS and soon it
will be sending graduates out into the world. I&amp;#39;m super happy and
proud of what the students have done and continue to do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Both of these really excite me. When I started, I figured it would be
about five years to get things running smoothly so to have both in
existence in 4 is super cool. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Other things I&amp;#39;m looking forward to? I&amp;#39;ll be giving a talk at SIGCSE2020
in a couple of months on how to take your students from GitHub
neophytes to pull request masters and then a full workshop version at
CSTA2020. I&amp;#39;m stoked about going to both conferences and also to help
Devorah once again run her  &lt;a href=&#34;http://blanketstatementproject.com/&#34;&gt;Blanket Statement&lt;/a&gt; project at CSTA.  If I can get the
funding there are also a couple of other conferences I&amp;#39;d love to
attend. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also looked over the list of speakers for CSTA2020 (harder to
navigate for SIGCSE) and am really  excited to see many friends
present. Also noticed Mark Emry will be presenting and really hope to
see Mark in person after something like over a dozen years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the personal side of things, Batya moved into her own apartment
just before the new year and Devorah&amp;#39;s setting up Batya&amp;#39;s room as a
fiber studio so we&amp;#39;ll have some adjustments on the home front but all
good and all exciting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m sure there are other exciting things to come in 2020 but that&amp;#39;s
enough for now.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>You Can&#39;t Win If You Don&#39;t Enter</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/you-cant-win-if-you-dont-enter/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2019 17:19:47 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/you-cant-win-if-you-dont-enter/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Or, as Wayne Gretzky said &amp;#34;You miss 100% of the shots you don&amp;#39;t take.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why do I mention this? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Because I&amp;#39;ve been hearing way too often from young people who are too
quick to deny themselves opportunities and too often these are
from students who have come from less advantaged backgrounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s Fall and I&amp;#39;ve been making my rounds visiting local schools to
talk to seniors about colleges in general and Hunter CS in
particular. I end the talk going over my Daedalus program which is
Hunter&amp;#39;s honors CS scholarship program.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since starting my &amp;#34;Fall tour&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;ve hard from too many students both in
person and via email saying things like &amp;#34;I don&amp;#39;t think I have the grades for,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;ll
never make it in,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s a waste of time for me to apply.&amp;#34; They might
be talking about my program or they might be talking about some other
college. Sometimes the students would indeed have less than a punchers
chance to get in to the program in question but other times their
academic profile would certainly get their foot in the door. In all
cases it made me sad that these students were denying themselves
possible opportunities. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I talk to these students I share instances where people who have
not met the required &amp;#34;paper profile&amp;#34; had indeed made the cut. I make
sure to be honest with them - I don&amp;#39;t sell them a bill of goods. They
chances of acceptance might be small but in the greater scheme of
things the cost of an application is insignificant compared to the benefit
of possibly getting into the program you really want (or at least
think you want).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve seen similar self doubt behaviour from college kids and young
adults. Some don&amp;#39;t apply for jobs because they dont&amp;#39; have every single
skill listed on a job requirements page or the company is too
lofty. Here I try to explain how these listings get made - how an HR
person adds every single possible skill. I don&amp;#39;t advocate lying on a
resume or job application but if they&amp;#39;ve got the core skills or domain
skills required for the job but not everything, apply - let the
company say no.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I mentioned at the top, too often I&amp;#39;ve been hearing things like
these from less advantaged kids. Kids that start with less and have to
fight for more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s hard enough for young people on their journeys through life. I
wish they wouldn&amp;#39;t make it harder by denying themselves potential
opportunities by not applying.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Waterfalls - a trip report</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
No, this post is not about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model&#34;&gt;Waterfall development model&lt;/a&gt;. Devorah
and I had a chance to take a little vacation up north.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First stop, Niagara Falls.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;br clear=&amp;#34;all&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We did the Canada side 9 years ago when we did our Erie Canal bike
trip (you can read about that by checking out some of my early &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2010-08-05-erie-canal-day-1.html/&#34;&gt;blog
posts&lt;/a&gt;). This time, the American side. My take is that the Canadian
side is more polished and all private attractions - think Times Square
or Disney. On the American side, the town itself is somewhat run down
but the attractions are all state park making them well maintained and
affordable. We did the &amp;#34;touristy stuff&amp;#34; - Maid of the Mist and Cave of
the winds, both of which were well worth it and also things like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://parks.ny.gov/parks/105/details.aspx&#34;&gt;Whirlpool State Park&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nypa.gov/&#34;&gt;Niagara Power Project&lt;/a&gt; along with a few
other attractions. We got a nice dinner at the Niagara Culinary
Institute and an okay one in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g48050-Lewiston_New_York.html&#34;&gt;Lewiston&lt;/a&gt;. There were a few things we
didn&amp;#39;t get to do and I&amp;#39;m not sure there&amp;#39;s enough to merit a return
trip but we really enjoyed the day and a half we spent at the falls.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next up was half a day at Old Fort Niagara about 25 minutes north of
the falls;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lots of cool history from both the war of 1812, revolution  and the French and
Indian war. We&amp;#39;re such a young nation so it was cool to see standing
structures from pre-colonial times.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From there we drove in to Canada. On &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dougpete&#34;&gt;Doug Peterson&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s suggestion we
stopped at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welland_Canal&#34;&gt;Welland Canal&lt;/a&gt; which connects Lake Ontario to Lake
Erie. It&amp;#39;s much wider than our own &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie_Canal&#34;&gt;Erie Canal&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately connects
the midwest to the port of Montreal and beyond.
&lt;/p&gt;

The image on the left is the cement barge St. Mary&amp;#39;s Cement II being
pushed by the pusher tug The Sea Eagle II. Using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.marinetraffic.com/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; site I was able
to track it going over to Cleveland. That website is really cool - on
it you can track &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the boats. It also has an API so you can have
your students use it in class projects. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The image on the right is the same boat a couple of minutes later
after the lock emptied and lowered. Really cool. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We settled in that evening in Hamilton Onntario.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hamilton is known as the Waterfall Capital of the world.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;br clear=&amp;#34;all&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It didn&amp;#39;t disappoint. We didn&amp;#39;t get to the two biggest falls - Webster
and Tews but we spent a long day of walking the trails and did get to
see six or seven of them including &lt;a href=&#34;https://tourismhamilton.com/devils-punchbowl&#34;&gt;the Devil&amp;#39;s Punchbowl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://tourismhamilton.com/albion-falls&#34;&gt;Albion
Falls&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://tourismhamilton.com/felkers-falls&#34;&gt;Felker&amp;#39;s Falls&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s pretty cool that we&amp;#39;re still in the
city but are on these hiking trails. We could probably have done
another day or two just hiking the rest of the falls and another day
to see other local attractions like the botanical gardens.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our last stop was &lt;a href=&#34;https://parks.ny.gov/parks/79/details.aspx&#34;&gt;Letchworth State Park.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Letchworth is truly a hidden gem just as the Ithaca area state parks -
Treman, Buttermilk Falls, and Taughannock but more so.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Beautiful waterfall and gorge views. You can go on a hardcore hike or
just drive from view to view. At the south end you&amp;#39;ve got the three
major waterfalls and at the north end the Mount Morris Dam. There&amp;#39;s
also some pretty good food at the Iris Inn which is at the south end
of the park. We didn&amp;#39;t stay there but if we go back, I think we will.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you haven&amp;#39;t been and get a chance, you won&amp;#39;t be
disappointed. There&amp;#39;s a reason Letchworth is called the Grand Canyon
of the East. Not nearly as big or majestic but just as beautiful in
it&amp;#39;s own right.
&lt;/p&gt;

to get to Toronto. When we do we&amp;#39;ll probably spend additional time in
Hamilton and Letchworth. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now it&amp;#39;s back home and try to get in a few more restful days before
the semester begins.

      <title>Alumni Anniversaries</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/alumni-anniversaries/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2019 07:32:02 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/alumni-anniversaries/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Two days ago, a teacher&amp;#39;s comment on a frustrating situation &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/outside-evaluators/&#34;&gt;made me
mad&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, I got to be part of something that made me very happy. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Last night, Devorah and I ventured out to Coney Island to celebrate
the twentieth wedding anniversary of two former students. It&amp;#39;s such a
joy and an honor to be included in these types of life events and even
more so to count the couple and so many other former students and
friends. Devorah joked that she&amp;#39;d been to more weddings of my former
students than of her own friends. Truth be told, I can say the same. I
commented that nowadays I&amp;#39;m more in touch with friends that I&amp;#39;ve
taught than my own high school and college classmates. Our hosts joked that
it was the right call because my former students are younger and that
helps keep me young :-).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What was also exciting was seeing the couple&amp;#39;s oldest daughter for the
first time in a year or so. She&amp;#39;ll be starting at Stuy next year. The
grow so fast. Almost makes me sad I&amp;#39;m no longer there. Missed my
chance to teach the offspring of my former students. Still, she&amp;#39;s in
great hands with the crew that&amp;#39;s still there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also had a chance to catch up with some other friends and their
families. Loved seeing young Abe, another &amp;#34;grandstudent&amp;#34; who I haven&amp;#39;t
seen since his bris two year ago.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For anyone out there just starting their teaching career - this is the
payoff. The relationships. I know it&amp;#39;s hokie but I say that as
teachers in a general sense we should strive to be a force of good in
our student&amp;#39;s lives. If we&amp;#39;re lucky we see it&amp;#39;s appreciated and we get
to see the results. 
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Codeland 2019</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/codeland-2019/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2019 19:46:38 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/codeland-2019/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I spent today at &lt;a href=&#34;https://codelandconf.com/&#34;&gt;Codeland&lt;/a&gt;, a one day conference in NYC designed for
developers in the early stages of their careers. Just as at CSTA, I
was there with the GitHub contingent.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Codeland had talks and a keynote in a common auditorium, smaller
breakout workshops and a couple of small vendor areas.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I spent most of the morning upstairs in the GitHub lounge so I onl
caught part of one morning talk. Up in the lounge we, along with the
other vendors - IBM, Flatiron health, and Command Line Hero were
available to talk shop and hang out with conference goers. To be
honest, not too many people came by. I attribute that to the fact that
we were up on the ninth floor and the elevators didn&amp;#39;t work very
well. We were in a nice space with plenty of areas for conference
goers to relax, schmooze, get a snack and even play games but it was
too much of an effort to get to us.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also decided not to attend any of the workshops and stayed up in the
lounge. The workshops were targeted at new devs early in their career
so while some looked interesting to me, I didn&amp;#39;t want to take up a
seat from anyone who really could benefit from them,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After lunch, I relocated to the downstairs vendor area. That was much
better. Since it was right near both the snacks and the main
auditorium there was much more foot traffic. I also got to hear and
see all the afternoon talks since audio and video were available right
near where I was set up. They were pretty cool. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For me, the best part of the conference was the ability to talk with
the conference attendees. On the one hand, I was there to talk GitHub
but I also had the chance to talk general tech with them. I got to
talk to people at all stages on their coding journeys. There were
undergraduate students studying CS, second career people either in
code schools or self learning, Former CS students who&amp;#39;s lives had gone
in other directions but now they&amp;#39;re looking to get back into tech and
more. I got to hear about the excitement of their adventures and tried
to give advice and encouragement to those having a hard time breaking
in to tech. Having shepherded so many people from neophytes to
professionals I&amp;#39;d like to think I could provide some guidance to some
of the people chatted with.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know if there are any other conferences like Codeland but if
there aren&amp;#39;t there should be. It can be hard to break into tech and
Codeland created both a safe environment for tech newbies and also
provided really valuable content. I wasn&amp;#39;t familiar with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.codenewbie.org/&#34;&gt;CodeNewbie&lt;/a&gt;,
the organization behind Codeland before but now I&amp;#39;ll have to see if I
can have a sit down with them to talk shop and tech ed.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A 10X Student Story</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/ten-x-student-story/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2019 15:39:40 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/ten-x-student-story/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There were a bunch of threads on the 10X Developer recently. You
know - that mythical beast that&amp;#39;s 10 times more productive than the
regular software engineer. I didn&amp;#39;t see any of the original threads
but I&amp;#39;m guessing they started with &amp;#34;your startup needs them&amp;#34; and then
moved to the &amp;#34;they can&amp;#39;t work with anyone&amp;#34; along with tons of fun
tongue and cheek 1X engineer tweets.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It got me thinking about 10X students. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regardless of what you think about 10X developers, 10X people do
exist - at least to the way I&amp;#39;m thinking about them. There are people
who in any given dimension are &amp;#34;better,&amp;#34; however you define that, than
other people. In our society, if they&amp;#39;re 10X in popular sports we
treat them like demi-gods and frequently when achievements are group
efforts, we, as a society designate one individual as the 10X star and
laud them rather than the group.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regardless, there are 10X people. At Stuy, I&amp;#39;ve had a chance to work
with a number of them and I want to tell you a story about one and how
it affected the way I look at my students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s go back to the early to mid 1990s. I was teaching my first crop
of CS students. Many were math team aces. One in particular, Alex was
a superstar. Alex would end up representing the US in the
International Math Olympiad where he scored a perfect paper. He ended
up going right from Stuy to grad school even though his friends, the
math chair and I were trying to encourage him to start as an
undergrad. Why were we pushing Alex not to skip undergrad? Because
Alex was wired differently. While he was truly a genius with respect
to mathematics and he did pretty well in his other classes by turning
everything into a math problem he was not good with people. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
His friends spent years pulling him out of his shell and seemed to be
making progress but felt that if he ended up cloistered in grad school
all progress would be lost. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the end, he went to grad school but this story is about a
programming competition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At some point, one of my students, Eliot, told me about the USACO and
that he and a few others wanted to participate. It would be one day at
Stuy - a Saturday I seem to recall. While Stuy was on the internet
back then, the competition wasn&amp;#39;t. We were working on IBM PS/2 machines
running DOS. The students would write the programs and run them, print
out their solutions and I would compare the solutions with the correct
answers. When all was said and done I either had to mail a disk with
the solutions or printouts, I forget which to Rob and Don in
Wisconsin. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over the course of the day, participants would come up to me with
solutions and I&amp;#39;d check them off. At one point, Alex came up and said
he was done. I asked him to bring up his printout. I got a blank
stare. We went back and forth for a while with Alex seemingly being
recalcitrant about not bringing it up but he finally did.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Meanwhile, the other participants started to notice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started to look over Alex&amp;#39;s code. Lots of variables. Typically named
X, XX, XXX, XXXX etc. Maybe there is something to the 10X dev not
being able to write code well with others :-).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I told Alex that I needed to see the printout with the input and
output. He looked at me quizzically. Again we had a few minutes of
back and forth and Alex went back to print out his results. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One again, the other students took note.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, Alex gave me the printout with the results and I started
comparing the answers to the desired output - the answers were REALLLY
LONG integers so I had to check digit by digit. All the while Alex
looked at me as though I was nuts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The competition concluded, we packed up and I took the stragglers out
for dinner at the local diner. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next week, some students apologized for Alex&amp;#39;s behavior. They
thought it was rude. Not as bad as what another math ace would do to a
teacher a couple of years later which caused that years math team to
go west side story on him and almost beat their teammate up for
disrespecting a teacher but still they thought Alex was out of line in
the way he treated me during the competition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After thinking about Alex&amp;#39;s interactions with people, I had a
different take.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My take was that Alex very much respected me. To him, at the start
when he said he was done, he felt that I was a smart guy so I saw how
trivial the problems would be for him to solve. He then understood
that rules said that he had to give me the printout of the programs. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then, to Alex, again, I was a smart guy so clearly I could instantly
see that his printouts were correct so why was I insisting on the
output? Finally when I had to compare the digits, Alex was very
confused. &amp;#34;Z&amp;#39;s a smart guy, surely he can instantly see that my
answers are correct‚Ä¶&amp;#34; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Alex wasn&amp;#39;t being disrespectful. He was showing me more respect than I
deserved. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My interactions with Alex through the rest of the year as well as
observing him with others confirmed this. This wasn&amp;#39;t a super smart
kid being a jerk and looking down on us mere mortals. Here was a kid
who saw the world differently and thought that the rest of us had his
gifts if not more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve had the opportunity to interact with a number of 10X
individuals. Some as students, some as peers and colleagues, and some
as friends. More often than not, in my experience,  they&amp;#39;re wonderful unassuming
people. They assume I bring as much if not more to the table than they
do and they value what I have to say. It&amp;#39;s my insecurity that makes me
uncomfortable if I don&amp;#39;t have my A game. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sure, sometimes they&amp;#39;re jerks but most of the 10X people I&amp;#39;ve
encountered are anything but. The nice thing is that when I do meet a
10X who&amp;#39;s a jerk, I can remind myself that I know an 11X who isn&amp;#39;t so
I don&amp;#39;t have to waste my time on the 10X who is.
&lt;/p&gt;

Many of us know &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cscheerleader&#34;&gt;Ria Galanos&lt;/a&gt;. Ria - a longtime friend and longtime CS
teacher who has been very active in the APCS community has started a
new chapter as a software engineer at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.yext.com/&#34;&gt;Yext&lt;/a&gt;. Ria&amp;#39;s also started
blogging about it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know the direction the blog will take but I&amp;#39;m sure it will be
influenced by Ria&amp;#39;s years as an educator. I&amp;#39;m also sure it will be
worth reading.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This morning, Ria added an RSS feed to the blog so you won&amp;#39;t miss a
post. You can us a reader service like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.feedly.com&#34;&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt; or if you&amp;#39;re an Emacs
wonk like me, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-31-elfeed-3/&#34;&gt;elfeed&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ebooks, Nypl and Process Starvation</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/ebooks-nypl-and-process-starvation/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2019 12:04:45 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/ebooks-nypl-and-process-starvation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m a big fan of E Ink e-readers. I had one a number of years ago. An &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mobiletechreview.com/gadgets/Astak-EZ-Reader.htm&#34;&gt;Aztak EZ
Reader&lt;/a&gt;. It was great. Small, cheap, and independent - that is, not
tied in to Amazon or Barnes and Nobles and I found myself doing a lot
more recreational reading with it. I still preferred paper for
technical books but for easy reading  there was nothing like having
tons of reading options always available.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Alas it sadly committed suicide by diving from my hand onto the hard
stone floor of the NY Post office as I waited on the passport line. I
tried other e-readers since then but found E ink so much easier on the
eyes. Not wanting to do my usual &amp;#34;schlepp all the books I might want
to read&amp;#34; on vacation a few years ago, I bit the bullet and bought a
kindle. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I originally had the EZ-Reader I loaded it with mostly public
domain books. With the Kindle, I have purchased a small number of
books from Amazon to go along with all sorts of goodies from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gutenberg.org/&#34;&gt;Project
Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt; but there&amp;#39;s also been one HUGE change in the landscape. The
&lt;a href=&#34;https://nypl.overdrive.com/&#34;&gt;New York Public Library&lt;/a&gt;.  Public libraries are some of our greatest
public goods and it&amp;#39;s unfortunate that they&amp;#39;re perpetually
underfunded. Where else can a kid or indeed anyone go on any given day
and spend time indoors with no expectation of spending money. What&amp;#39;s
more in addition to books and now movies and sometimes games they
provide all manner of community services and programs to and for the
public. In terms of e-books though, you can use the NYPL without
leaving the comfort of your home.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
NYPL has a web site where you can search for and take out ebooks and
have them sent right to your kindle for 28 days at a time. If they
don&amp;#39;t have enough copies - something of a ludicrous point for a
digital resource, you can place it on hold. If it&amp;#39;s close to being
due, you can renew it unless someone else is on the queue at which
point the renewal request becomes a hold request. It&amp;#39;s all rather
seamless.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My reading habits now regularly include taking out books from the
library and that&amp;#39;s led to an interesting resource issue - process
starvation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In case there are any on CS people reading this, everything running on
your computer at any point in time is a process. Each process gets a
small slice of computer time and it appears that the computer is
running everything at once. Some processes have a higher priority and
can get a bigger slice of time. On older &amp;#34;batch processing&amp;#34; systems,
high priority processes or jobs would run before lower priority
ones. For example, in a university setting, jobs submitted by
professors would be run before jobs submitted by grad students before
those submitted by undergrads. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This of course could lead to some processes never getting run if
higher priority jobs keep getting submitted. There&amp;#39;s an apocryphal
story about a computer at MIT that had a job submitted in 1967 but
still hadn&amp;#39;t run in 1973.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So what&amp;#39;s happening to me? I have a number of free books just sitting
on my kindle as well as books that I&amp;#39;ve purchased. My friend Paul said
I had to read &amp;#34;Algorithms to Live By&amp;#34; so that&amp;#39;s thre. So is &amp;#34;Captains
Courageous&amp;#34; because I think I want to read it. There are also a bunch of
others. The trouble is, I keep seeing books that I want to read in the
library and I only have a 28 day window to read them, Most recently it
was &amp;#34;Sapiens&amp;#34; but before that it was &amp;#34;Turn Right at Machi Picchu&amp;#34; and
I read that right after &amp;#34;How Chance and Stupidity Have Changed
History,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;The Witch of Lime Street.&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;The Man with the Sawed-Off
Leg and Other Tales of a New York City Block.&amp;#34; As soon as, or before I
finish one, there&amp;#39;s a new one on hold and then on loan and the books I
own keep getting pushed back.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Operating Systems usually implement process aging. If a job isn&amp;#39;t
handled fdor a long period of time its priority is increased. This
means that eventually it will be run. I guess I could do that and just
force myself to not read the next hot library book but I don&amp;#39;t kow if
I have that in me.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Busy Week</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/busy-week/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2019 07:32:49 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/busy-week/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m glad it&amp;#39;s Saturday morning. It&amp;#39;s been a busy week. It looks like
there&amp;#39;s a couple more to plough through but hopefully then I can catch
my breath over spring break.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why so busy? It&amp;#39;s the same old story - you&amp;#39;ve got all those projects
that you&amp;#39;re waiting on and everything comes in at the same time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start off, it&amp;#39;s college decision season. The high school seniors
all know their options and are deciding where to go. While we&amp;#39;re still
considering some applications to my Daedalus honors CS program, most
of the offers have gone out or will go out within a couple of days.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started the week with an info session about the program. eBay was
nice enough to host. I&amp;#39;ve held this session there now for the past
three years. First time, I had about 20 attendees and am not sure if
it made a difference in any high school senior&amp;#39;s decision. Last year
we had about 40 in the room but this year we reached capacity
at 65. Each senior was allowed to brign a +1. Some didn&amp;#39;t, many
brought a parent but a few brought a friend. At the end of the
session, most of the friends sought me out and asked if it was too
late to apply. I told them where to fill everything out but
unfortunately I didn&amp;#39;t know if I would be allowed to consider them or
not. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also had about 10 of my current students at the event. This was the
first time I was able to have that many. First time, I only had a
handful in the program and last year we first had to reschedule due to
weather and most of my students had class on the rain date. Having a
bunch of current students there to mix and talk with the applicants
was proabably the most important part of the evening. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end, the high schoolers had left and the students and I were
BSing along with Paul, our host when Paul offered a tour and then went
into an impromptu tech talk with the kids. I really
wanted to get home to bed but the kids were loving it so I let it
ride.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All in all it was a great night for my current students and I&amp;#39;m hoping
also for the high schoolers but it was a draining way to start the
week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also had a big CUNY2X event last week on Thursday evening. Around
50 students interviewing with fifteen or so companies for summer
internships. We&amp;#39;ve had this event three semesters in a row now. It&amp;#39;s a
long evening but at the end of the day lots of students get both
interviewing experience as well as offers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Things also started to move this past week on our CS Education
programs but not in a good way. Rather than approving our programs
they came back with a bunch of questions. It&amp;#39;s rather frustrating
since we cover everything they want and then some but they don&amp;#39;t seem
to be seeing it. For example, we&amp;#39;ve got a big chunk of our topics
course where we&amp;#39;ll essentially cover full stack development light and
we cover way in excess of anything in NY&amp;#39;s forthcoming standards on
networks and systems not to mention things like cybersecurity,
accessibility, UX and more in that unit but the state said they don&amp;#39;t see
any evidence to that effect. So I had too start to take our syllabi and bloat
them with excruciating detail. Something I&amp;#39;ll be doing over the
weekend and into next week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To add to the week I had to pack. I&amp;#39;ve been pushing for an office move
for about two years. When I came to Hunter they placed me physically
in the Ed school. It made sense - I&amp;#39;m officially appointed there but
I&amp;#39;ve done most of my work so far with CS. Even when my CSED programs
start, many of the students will be grad students or working teachers
so they won&amp;#39;t be on campus much except for when they teach. On the
other hand the CS undergrads are around all the time. Well, Monday I&amp;#39;m
moving to a new office right by the all the CS action. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s also been a busy semester for my course planning. I&amp;#39;m teaching
data structures at Hunter for the first time. I&amp;#39;ve taught it many
times before but that was to a known audience with a different
toolset - Java instead of C++. To be honest, I&amp;#39;m not particularly
happy with how I&amp;#39;ve been doing. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve been terrible but
I&amp;#39;ve left plenty of classes feeling I&amp;#39;ve missed my marks. I know
that it&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;ll have figured out and next time around I&amp;#39;ll be
back up to speed but it&amp;#39;s made planning and reflection more of a time
sink and it always bothers me when I don&amp;#39;t feel my students are
getting my best.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, it&amp;#39;s been a busy week in a busy semester. For the most part, good
things happening but I&amp;#39;m really looking forward to spring break.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Monitor</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/new-monitor/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2019 17:38:09 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/new-monitor/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;figure class=&amp;#34;z_image_right&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;img src=&amp;#34;/img/monitors.jpg&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;250px&amp;#34;/&amp;gt; 
&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Got a new monitor today and wanted to share.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My old one was a 27&amp;#34; Hanns G. Actually, the old ones - my old set up
was 2 of them side by side. When I started at Hunter, I was given a
piddly small monitor so I tried to buy my own 27&amp;#34; Hanns G to bring in
but they were no longer available. The 27&amp;#34; jobs available then were
much more expensive so my work monitor situation has been sadly
lacking.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The 2 27&amp;#34; setup worked pretty well but then I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/the-best-display-for-programming-8aad0be4227d&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; post and did a
little research. It turns out that Costco has a great deal on an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.costco.com/LG-43UD79-B-43%2522-Class-Ultra-HD-4K-IPS-Monitor.product.100378322.html&#34;&gt;LG
43&amp;#34; 4K&lt;/a&gt; monitor so I took the plunge. I also had to pick up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/EVGA-GeForce-Passive-Graphics-02G-P4-6332-KR/dp/B073VPKV26/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=gt+1030&amp;amp;qid=1552171987&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-3&#34;&gt;cheap
video card&lt;/a&gt; to drive it since I was just using onboard video and my
setup is pretty old.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s HUGE. I love it but am now working to figure out how best to set
things up. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The added bonus is that I can now bring one or both of the 27&amp;#34;
monitors to work!!!!!!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re on the  market for a new monitor I have to say that I&amp;#39;m
really happy with the LG. Just wanted to share.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Catskills Conf -  Knitting for Good 2018</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/catskills-blanket-2018/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Oct 2018 17:00:55 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/catskills-blanket-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Two weekends ago I took a group of my first year students up to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://catskillsconf.com&#34;&gt;Catskills Conf&lt;/a&gt;, an annual event that I describe as &amp;#34;light tech
conference with a focus on diversity and inclusion meets summer camp.&amp;#34;
I&amp;#39;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/catskills-2017/&#34;&gt;written about&lt;/a&gt; the event before if anyone&amp;#39;s interested in more
details. As in past years, Devorah ran her &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/knitting-tech-conference/&#34;&gt;knitting for good&lt;/a&gt;
project. In each of the first two years of the project, attendees of
Catskills Conf learned how to know and collectively knit, crocheted
and assembled a blanket for Project Linux which provides hand made
blankets to children in crisis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This year we made two:
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Ta Da! Presenting the blankets created by the participants of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/catskillsconf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt;  2018 for &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ProjectLinus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@ProjectLinus&lt;/a&gt;  Burgundy yarn courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ShaarayTefilaNY?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@ShaarayTefilaNY&lt;/a&gt;  Sanctuary Stitchers. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/MiEGmGGcqG&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/MiEGmGGcqG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Devorah Zamansky (@DevorahZamansky) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DevorahZamansky/status/1056636588837556225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;October 28, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I was off this morning &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/diane_levitt/status/1056560530956214272&#34;&gt;talking&lt;/a&gt; to high school students at
Cornell Technion, Devorah was finishing off the blankets and
delivering them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In past years, the blanket was usually mostly made by a small handful
of experienced knitters who attended the conference. This year was
very different. For the first time, many of my students took part in
the project.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/cconf-knitting-2018.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250&#34; height=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/cconf-knitting-2018-2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250&#34; height=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A few already knew how to know but more were learning for the first
time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I love that were at a tech conference and at the same time learning to
be creative with our hands and all the while doing some good for
others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Already looking forward to next year.
&lt;/p&gt;
