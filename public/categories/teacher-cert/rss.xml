      <description>&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;ve a week to go in the summer intensive part of our CS teacher
certification program so after an intense few weeks, I can start to
breath a little. There&amp;#39;s still a lot to be done but I feel like I can
breath. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first three and a half weeks covered programming and data
structures with a bunch of pedagogy mixed in. This meant a lot of day
to day adjustment of what we were teaching and how we were teaching
it, after all, this is the first time a program like this has ever
existed let alone shifted from in person to remote. Now we&amp;#39;ve moved in
to the last course - Topics, combined with yet more pedagogy. This is
the easy part. Each cohort member selected some area of computer
science that is both new to them and not covered in a typical K12 CS
class. We provided some ideas but they were free to come up with their
own. They&amp;#39;re spending time learning about the topic and designing a
lesson or unit around it. The deliverable is a unit plan with
resources and guidance on preferred pedagogy techniques and a code
implementation of the topic. The idea is that in addition to showing
their own expertise that other cohort members can use the project as a
resource for their own classes at some future date.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next few days consist of us supporting their work while mixing in
a few lessons on topics that they didn&amp;#39;t select. Much easier than the
first few weeks. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking forward to some cool presentations - Blockchain, public key
encryption, some machine learning and more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Really happy about how this has all played out.
&lt;/p&gt;
