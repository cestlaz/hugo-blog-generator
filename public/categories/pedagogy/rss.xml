      <title>Merge Over Zoom - A Hunter CS Certification Program Update</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/merge-over-zoom/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2020 19:00:55 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/merge-over-zoom/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;ve been talking sorting and searching in our teacher certification
program and today was all about the merge sort. One of the strategies
we use when teaching it in person involves sorting a deck of cards by
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-02-27-dumbass/&#34;&gt;Tom Sawyering&lt;/a&gt; it with the class. It&amp;#39;s fun and it&amp;#39;s effective but you
can&amp;#39;t do it over Zoom. What to do? We didn&amp;#39;t want to just jump into
the nuts and bolts of merge sort. We could - we&amp;#39;ve got a great group
of teachers who could handle it but we&amp;#39;re not just talking about
content in the program we&amp;#39;re also talking about pedagogy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How could we adapt a divide and conquer algorithm where we split a
deck of cards and pass it out to the class to a remote environment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s what we came up with.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started with a story about how I pitched Hunter about having a party
with this first cohort when they all earn their NY State CS Teaching
Certificates (assuming we could have a party in person). They said yes
but to keep costs down I had to get them a list of possible
restaurants to order from sorted by lowest price. We decided to use
Chinese restaurants and the price of pork dumplings. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I had a long list and was going to have to go to the seamless page for
each one and get the price and then sort them. Not fun.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since I&amp;#39;m running the program but have two instructors - JonAlf and
Topher working with me, we decided I could &amp;#34;volunteer&amp;#34; each to do half
the list. They weren&amp;#39;t happy so they looked for Teaching Assistants to
pawn the work off on but having none went to the students. We
continued with the split until a bunch of students each had to look up
one and only one restaurant to find the price of the pork. We then
passed the restaurants and prices back up the chain and voila - merge
sort. .
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We basically were able to replicate the in class card sorting
experience with something that we could do over Zoom. It went over
pretty well. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;re going to talk more about what we did and why and the idea of
actively engaging students in different ways over virtual conference
technologies tomorrow. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was all pretty cool.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Try Something New - Quicksort</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/try-something-new/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2020 11:11:51 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/try-something-new/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Many teachers are reluctant to try new things. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s a bad
case of &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;vealwaysdoneitthisway-itis.&amp;#34; Sometimes it&amp;#39;s not being
comfortable with the new way or not having the time to develop
whatever happens to be needed for the lesson and sometimes it&amp;#39;s even
coming from a good place. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What&amp;#39;s that good place? Concern - if I try this new way and it doesn&amp;#39;t
work I&amp;#39;m going to lose some students and never get them back. My
population is too at risk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ok, I buy that but I don&amp;#39;t agree with it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There will be a normal ebb and flow to your lessons anyway. Some days
will be great, some not so much. Some lessons will be amazing, some
will put the kids to sleep. Besides, you can almost always recover
from a bad experience the following week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Last week was Quicksort time. I&amp;#39;ve approached the problem in a variety
of ways over the years. I straight out presented the algorithm,
approached it from a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2010-03-14-sorting-from-top-and-from-bottom.html/&#34;&gt;functional point of view&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/quick-sort-starting/&#34;&gt;put a specific element
in place&lt;/a&gt;, approached it from a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-03-12-select-to-sort.html/&#34;&gt;select the nth smallest&lt;/a&gt; item point of view
and probably a few others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This time, I thought I&amp;#39;d try code tracing. The motivation was that the
in place partition algorithm can be a little hairy. The idea is
actually pretty simple but first year CS2 students can find it
difficult. This time, I presented them with the code and some trial
runs for them to trace through. From there we developed the algorithm
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I won&amp;#39;t know if this approach was effective or not until next week but
my gut was telling me that it was a bit bumpy. I don&amp;#39;t think I was
effectively  able to connect from the code they worked through up to
the algorithm. Some of the other approaches I&amp;#39;ve tried over the years
left me equally unimpressed with myself but at the end of the day they
weren&amp;#39;t disasters so I&amp;#39;m guessing the class will ultimately prove to
have been alright. Right now, I think the approach I used a couple of
years ago of motivating quicksort by putting a specific element in
place works best for me and my classes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The moral of the story? I tried something. I don&amp;#39;t think it worked
particularly well. That&amp;#39;s okay. I&amp;#39;ll probably rework it and try it
again in the future but as for today I know my kids will be
fine. Maybe I botched the quicksort a bit but I&amp;#39;ll fix that over the
next few classes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The real lesson of the day - Don&amp;#39;t be afraid to try something new. We
want our students to be unafraid of failure. We should be as
well. It&amp;#39;s rare the stakes are so high that we can&amp;#39;t stumble an bumble
a bit of a lesson and not recover. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I was just starting out one of my mentors gave me some great
advice: &amp;#34;You can always fix it tomorrow.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teacher Centric Teaching</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-centric-teaching/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2020 08:27:09 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-centric-teaching/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Every few years the experts give us some new magic bullet, some new
 &lt;del&gt;teaching fad&lt;/del&gt; research based pedagogical technique. Teachers are
 trained in it, forced to use it - frequently as a one size fits
 all. If we do, we&amp;#39;re good teachers, if we don&amp;#39;t we get the dreaded
 ineffective on our annual ratings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was reminded of this when reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/guzdial&#34;&gt;Mark Guzdial&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s recent blog post on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://computinged.wordpress.com/2020/01/13/computing-education-lessons-learned-from-the-2010s-what-i-got-wrong/&#34;&gt;things he got wrong&lt;/a&gt; in Computing Education. It&amp;#39;s a really great
post. Mark mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)&#34;&gt;constructivism&lt;/a&gt; and it made me think of a few
years ago when constructivism was all the rage. If you didn&amp;#39;t set your
class up for &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_learning&#34;&gt;discovery learning&lt;/a&gt; all the time you were clearly a bad
teacher. I&amp;#39;d sit on on CS PD sessions, listen to principals and
supervisors talk about what they wanted to see in classes and on and
on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you weren&amp;#39;t a constructivist educator you weren&amp;#39;t a good educator.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course a few years earlier it was something else.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back when I started it was cooperative learning and
cooperative learning isn&amp;#39;t just group work - you had to follow the
formula. Each student in a group had a role, there were specific
stages of work and everything had to be just so.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There were other fads along the way. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you were lucky and had a good supervisor you didn&amp;#39;t have to worry
about the fads, the research, the nonsense. You could focus on your
development as a teacher. They might work with you on questioning, for
instance - regardless of the flavor of the month, a teacher will ask
questions and facilitate discussion and they will surely insulate you
from whatever nonsense the bean counters want to see as long as you&amp;#39;re
doing right by your students. On the other hand, a bad supervisor
would mean stressful set up observations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even without Mark&amp;#39;s post, I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about this a lot since
we&amp;#39;re about to launch our CS Teacher Certification programs at
Hunter so I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about these fads from a teacher
preparation point of view. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many of these fads have some value - they&amp;#39;re tools in the toolbelt to
be used as needed. The problem is that supervisors, and in my
experience, professional development and teacher preparation programs
make teaching 100% about the student. While the student is in fact the
customer and who&amp;#39;s development is the goal of our work, you can&amp;#39;t
ignore other factors. Environment and resources are two of these other
factors and a big one is the teachers individual strengths,
weaknesses, and tendencies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cooperative Learning never really worked for me - at least not whole
hog. As a &amp;#34;Cooperative Learning teacher&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;d be meh at best. On the
other hand, I&amp;#39;ve taken plays from the cooperative learning playbook
and applied them as I&amp;#39;ve seen useful. Sometimes it didn&amp;#39;t work,
sometimes to great effect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a teacher, I always took the advice of one of my early fencing
mentors. I was receiving conflicting advice from multiple well
respected coaches and more experienced fencers. My mentor said &amp;#34;listen
to what they all have to say, think about it, figure out what best
will work for you and do that.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As to running my teacher prep programs, I&amp;#39;m going to do my best to
make sure that we do recognize that teachers bring different things to
the table and it will my job to help them maximize their
effectiveness. This means that we can&amp;#39;t blindly follow the favored
teaching techniques du jour but rather we have to look at all sorts of
methods and combine them with our teachers strengths, abilities, and
tendencies, and their specific classroom situations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It should be fun.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My test grading policy</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/grading-policy/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2019 17:13:24 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/grading-policy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I was working on writing a midterm the other day so figured I&amp;#39;d talk a
bit about my test grading policy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before getting to the specifics, let me set the stage. I spent most of
my career at Stuyvesant - a public magnet school in
NYC. There are many great students who are interested in learning but
there&amp;#39;s also a focus on grades. and this leads to a non-insignificant portion of
the student body that is grade obsessed and will do everything and
anything for every point possible. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We called it grade grubbing. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Grade grubbing goes beyond asking for points you think you deserve and
it comes in many forms. It&amp;#39;s when you BS your way through an essay or
paper and put in as many key phrases as possible and hope the teacher
only sees those when scanning through hundreds of papers. It&amp;#39;s taking
that same paper and only showing the key correct phrases during an
appeal and ignoring the contradictory key phrases a few lines
below. It&amp;#39;s when you write an answer in a somewhat ambiguous way that
if marked wrong allows for an appeal. It&amp;#39;s appealing a low grade
because &amp;#34;I always get over 95&amp;#34; and it even involves cheating
sometimes and changing answers after the fact.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, this isn&amp;#39;t the majority of the class. It&amp;#39;s only a small percent
but it&amp;#39;s pretty annoying and it had a bit of influence on my testing
policy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what&amp;#39;s my policy? It&amp;#39;s pretty simple. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rule 1 - once I return the test you can&amp;#39;t ask me anything about your
exam until either we go over the exam in class or if we don&amp;#39;t until
after I&amp;#39;ve shared the answer key with the class. If you do ask me
about the exam before we&amp;#39;ve gone over it you forfiet your right to ask
for any points back on any mismarked questions. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rule 2 - If you appeal a question for points - that is come up and say
&amp;#34;I got this question right&amp;#34; and it turns out that you are correct, you
get your points. If, on the other hand, the quesiton is incorrect, I
reserve the right to take off the points deducted a second time. That
is, if you originally lost 5 points you could now lose up to 10.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This might sound harsh and somewhat jerky but it really isn&amp;#39;t. Due to
the nature of CS exams students can always be 100% certain that their
answer is correct because they can always try it out on a
computer. That&amp;#39;s the point. If something is marked wrong, I want the
student to take the time to see what&amp;#39;s going on before appealing the
grade. Questions that can&amp;#39;t be absolutely tested are of course excempt
from this policy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If a student comes up to me and says &amp;#34;hey, i know this is wrong - I
tested it and I&amp;#39;m not asking for points, I just don&amp;#39;t understand
what&amp;#39;s going on&amp;#34; I would never deduct more points and in fact have
sometimes lowered deductions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As it turns out, I&amp;#39;ve never actually ended up taking off extra points.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The whole idea is to stop the reflexive grade grubbing and get
students to think about the problems and solutions. It also helps in
keeping teacher harrassment to a minimum :-). 
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teaching techniques - industry to classroom and classroom to industry</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/industry-techniques-in-class/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2019 12:34:04 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/industry-techniques-in-class/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There are things we do in school and there are things we do in
industry and they&amp;#39;re not always the same. In school we might use a
learning language or an IDE which gives additional support and at
times even take away language features while at work you might you
might make heavy use of continuous integration tools. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, sometimes we use the same things. Java is used in
schools and in industry, StackOverflow consulted in both and many
schools use professional IDEs like Eclipse.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While the things I mentioned above, whether the same or different are
on the tooling side, there are also things on the technique side that
are used both in school and in industry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The most well publicized concept is probably &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming&#34;&gt;Pair Programming&lt;/a&gt; - the
idea of having two programmers develop using a shared
computer. There&amp;#39;s more to it than that and tons of variations but
that&amp;#39;s the crux of the idea. Proponents claim it increases programmer
efficiency and lowers error rates but others would rather not follow
the practice. Some feel that it&amp;#39;s great in certain environments like
when onboarding a new team member.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We hear CS Teachers talk about pairing in their classes all the time -
&amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s an industry technique&amp;#34; but to me the interesting thing is that I
think many teachers, particularly more senior ones came up with pair
programming independent of it as an industry technique. It came out of
not having enough computers. This invariably leads to kids pairing
up. Now, you&amp;#39;ll say &amp;#34;but pair programming isn&amp;#39;t just two kids sharing
a computer.&amp;#34; I agree but when good teachers do group work it isn&amp;#39;t
just kids left to their own devices working in a group. Over time,
teachers who &amp;#34;discover&amp;#34; pair programming come up with ways to make it
effective in their classrooms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other interesting thing is that pair programming serves different
purposes at work vs in schoo. At work it&amp;#39;s supposed to increase
programming efficiency and help them develop better code more
quickly. In the classroom, besides addressing the lack of computers,
it&amp;#39;s used as a tool to provide feedback to students, have them support
each other, and create a cooperative supportive environment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another technique CS teachers use is subgoal labeling. The gist here
is that you write down or label smaller goals within your
program. It&amp;#39;s an idea I used for years but only relatively recently
learned its name.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The interesting thing here is that I used this idea as a professional
programming well before I ever taught and I don&amp;#39;t recall it ever being
used in any of my classes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The idea just made sense. I&amp;#39;d write a function and pepper it with
comments indicating the parts s or subgoals I&amp;#39;d need to write code for
to complete the function. I don&amp;#39;t know if subgoal labelling is or ever
was a prevelent technique in professional programming but the related
idea of writing function stubs is. The idea here is that as you
develop your program write out an empty placeholder function, a stub,
when you realize you need it and fill it in later. This is something
of a subgoal but at the function level.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, here we have two practices. One that is certainly used in both
the classroom and in industry and one that likely is. The practices
seem to be examples of convergent evolution. Developed independently
but with similar albeit somewhat different benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There have to me more practices like this. If you know any, please
share.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Is Good Teaching</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/what-is-good-teaching/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2019 17:13:57 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/what-is-good-teaching/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I had a conversation with my principal during my last year at
Stuy. She said &amp;#34;whenever the superintendent or high level education
people come and ask to see our best teachers I can never bring them to
Jim&amp;#39;s class.&amp;#34; Everyone knows that Jim is the best. I describe him as
&amp;#34;the teacher I aspire to be.&amp;#34;  What&amp;#39;s the problem? The problem is that
Jim didn&amp;#39;t teach the way the powers that be wanted him to teach. He
didn&amp;#39;t do discovery learning, kids didn&amp;#39;t work in groups, there&amp;#39;s
typically nothing that you could check off on the &amp;#34;best way to teach&amp;#34;
list. Jim&amp;#39;s an old school teacher. Teacher dominant. He leads the
discussion, asks questions, circulates while the kids work on
problems etc. Why does it work? A combination of things. He know his
math, charisma, force of personality, empathy, and a lot of other
factors. One could dismiss it as saying &amp;#34;it&amp;#39;s Stuy, it&amp;#39;s easy&amp;#34; but he
was the best at a high needs school before he was the best at Stuy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was thinking about this for a few reasons. One is I watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1ib43q3uXQ&amp;amp;list=WL&amp;amp;index=52&amp;amp;t=0s&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;
video by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Felienne&#34;&gt;Felienne Hermans&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s a good video, many good points. I
particularly like when she talked about talking to a room of teachers
about a new &amp;#34;discovery&amp;#34; about learning only to find that teachers have
known it for decades. Basically, Felienne pushes back on the discovery
learning and let them play that&amp;#39;s dominated the CS Education
space. She talks about her success with direct instruction. Another is
that we&amp;#39;re starting to see more acceptance and voices for
direct instruction in the CS Ed space as a whole. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Personally, I think this is a good thing, after all, it&amp;#39;s more my
style. On the other hand, I don&amp;#39;t want the pendulum to swing too
far. I was talking to a history teacher at Stuy when they brought in
the Danielson &lt;del&gt;nonsense&lt;/del&gt; Framework. She&amp;#39;s a good teacher but she was
sheepish about Danielson. She said that Danielson worked for her - it
aligned with the way she taught and made her seem like the absolute
best. She was and is an excellent teacher but we all have holes in our
game. She didn&amp;#39;t want to be held  up as an exemplar of great teaching
where she knew that chances are there will be a successor to Danielson
and chances are something else will be in vogue and she won&amp;#39;t be so
officially terrific anymore. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right now, direct instruction is coming back. Who knows if it will
become the darling of the policy makers but regardless, a teaching
style or technique&amp;#39;s value can&amp;#39;t be determined without considering
other factors. The teacher&amp;#39;s personal style, the students, the
resources, class time, and much more. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what is a teacher to do? Add all the tools to your toolbox. I&amp;#39;m
not big on cooperative learning but I&amp;#39;ve peppered it in now and
then. Sometimes, it&amp;#39;s best to have the students discover things,
something you&amp;#39;ve got to tell them. Sometimes they should work on
things solo, sometimes in teams. I&amp;#39;ve taught classes that were all
projects and classes that had limited projects. Acquire all the tools
and use them as YOU think best. It&amp;#39;s the teacher with the skin in the
game. Not the policy makers, thought leaders, researchers, and
influences. More importantly it&amp;#39;s the teacher that knows their
students best - where they are, what they need and how to do the best
they can given the limited resources they have. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m obviously not excusing teachers who do one side lectures or who
just phone it in but the majority of teachers work hard to do it right
and should be given the freedom to do just that.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Monday&amp;#39;s the start of the Spring semester. Other than the 8:00am start
I&amp;#39;m looking forward to it. My 8:00am class is the honors/lab component
that goes with CS1. I taught it last semester and during each of the
past two years at Hunter. My second class is the follow up  - more OOP
/ C++, data structures and some algorithms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The material is old hat. I&amp;#39;ve taught it in Java more times than I can
count and also in C++ albeit many years ago. What&amp;#39;s new is that I&amp;#39;m
teaching my Hunter kids and I&amp;#39;m doing it in a college framework - two
days a week, 1:15 a session. I&amp;#39;m not thinking too much about how I&amp;#39;ll
teach each class - I usually figure that out in the moment - not
actually in the class but week to week based on the flow of the
class. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right now, I have to make final decisions on sequencing, at least for
the start of the class. We got ahead of the game by covering most of
the C++ topics - inheritance, templates, overloading etc. at the end
of last semester so that
leaves all the data structures, algorithms, dynamic structures, and
memory management, recursion, and sorting and searching. If I have
time I&amp;#39;d also love to get into some graph stuff. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s the plan, at lest for now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;ll start with recursion. They had the basics last term but now
we&amp;#39;ll talk about search - I usually focus this around a maze
solver. After this we&amp;#39;ll place recursion on hold - at least in terms
of class time and move to linked lists and dynamic memory. We&amp;#39;ll
follow this with sorting. The idea is that students have trouble
getting comfortable with both recursion and also with dynamic
structures first time through. Rather than ploughing  through from
recursion to the recursive sorts I&amp;#39;m hoping that putting the dynamic
lists in between will give recursion some time to marinate in the
background. Likewise I&amp;#39;m hoping that the dynamic memory stuff can
marinate through the sorting unit for when we revisit it with stacks,
queues, and trees after sorting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know if this is the optimal way of sequencing the topics but I
think it will work pretty well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;ll see as the semester progresses. If things are going swimmingly I
can always call an audible.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Let Teachers Teach</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/guzdial&#34;&gt;Mark Guzdial&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s post the other day about &lt;a href=&#34;https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/232557-direct-instruction-is-better-than-discovery-but-what-should-we-be-directly-instructing/fulltext&#34;&gt;direct isntruction&lt;/a&gt; struck a chord with
me. Right up front, Mark said:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The research evidence is growing that students learn better through direct instruction rather than through a discovery-based method, where we expect students to figure things out for themselves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Quite a surprise to the teachers who have been beaten over the head
with &amp;#34;everything must be discovery&amp;#34; in recent years. 
At the end of the post, Mark writes:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m a follower of the research Felienne is citing in her blog post, and agree that direct instruction is better than discovery learning for introductory courses
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I found myself very much agreeing with Mark. I&amp;#39;m not surprised. It&amp;#39;s
true that Mark and I have traded blog comments with me saying that
a teacher dominant classroom can be very effective and Mark saying
lecturing is bad but after a while I realized that we were saying the
same thing. To me, a teacher dominant high school class means teacher
directed active learning experience and not a droning college lecture. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event, back to direct instruction vs discovery. It seems
like the pendulum is swinging again. A few years ago it was all about
discovery and now direct instruction is ok. There are two problems
here. The first is that in a few years it will be something
else. Before the discovery learning fad we had other fads. When I
started teaching it was cooperative learning. I also went through the
portfolio movement. There were other fads along the way including yet
another &amp;#34;new math.&amp;#34; At some point we got back to traditional direct
instruction, then discovery and that brings us back up to today.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The second problem is a big one that&amp;#39;s often ignored. Regardless of
what the research says or doesn&amp;#39;t say and what teachers know or don&amp;#39;t
know the powers that be have time and time again decided upon the one
true way to teach and tried to force it upon teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It doesn&amp;#39;t work that way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The missing piece of the puzzle is the fact that teachers bring
different things to the table and that&amp;#39;s a fact that&amp;#39;s often
ignored. When teachers are observed, at least in NY, supervisors want
to see what they want to see. After Danielson was implemented in NYC I
was talking to a friend who almost sheepishly told me that she was
getting great evaluations because her teaching style aligned perfectly
with Danielson but she knew that when something else came into vogue
all of a sudden she&amp;#39;d no longer be &amp;#34;highly effective.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I started, cooperative learning was all the rage but it didn&amp;#39;t
work for me. Since it didn&amp;#39;t work for me, it didn&amp;#39;t work for my
students. This didn&amp;#39;t mean that I couldn&amp;#39;t cherry pick aspects of
cooperative learning and use them to good effect nor did it mean that
I couldn&amp;#39;t run a cooperative learning experience effectively from time
to time  but it meant that I couldn&amp;#39;t whole hog teach the way I was
&amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to teach. In another case, I knew a teacher who was a very
strong lecturer and I mean this in the traditional one sided lecture
style. He was much weaker when using active learning techniques and in
no way could he give up control to a cooperative learning
experience. That was who he was. He was most effective as a lecturer
for better or worse. With the right group of kids it worked pretty
well. Certainly better than if he was forced to teach in a way that
was contrary to who he was. I&amp;#39;ve also outright asked some great math teacher
friends of mine about &amp;#34;the research&amp;#34; on how to teach and the responses
I&amp;#39;ve gotten back were generally either &amp;#34;I don&amp;#39;t read the research&amp;#34; or
&amp;#34;it doesn&amp;#39;t work for me so I do what I do.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All this isn&amp;#39;t to say that research isn&amp;#39;t important and that a teacher
shouldn&amp;#39;t master a variety of techniques and tools. A good preservice
program will leave a teacher with a cabinet full of tools to draw from
and the expertise to know themselves, their students, and what tools
to put in the toolbelt for an any given class. Teachers should
likewise be trained to maximize their inherent tendencies and talents
and blend in teaching techniques as appropriate. Good professional development
should bring new ideas and new techniques to teachers and should
consider who they can be added in to a teacher&amp;#39;s practice rather than
to replace it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, teachers should be allowed to teach. It&amp;#39;s horrible that
there&amp;#39;s a movement to more and more scripted lessons and to tell
teachers how to teach. It was bad when I started and it&amp;#39;s only gotten
worse.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fortunately, some supervisors do indeed get it. Back when I was a
young teacher I was talking to a supervisor about this and he told me
that he observed a class he started with one basic question: &amp;#34;is
learning going on?&amp;#34; Everything flowed from there.
&lt;/p&gt;
