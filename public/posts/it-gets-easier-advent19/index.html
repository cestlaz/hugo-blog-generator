Today&#39;s <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/19">Advent of Code</a> problem was a variant on the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/JosephusProblem.html">Josephus
problem</a>.
</p>
<p>
I recalled that there was a formula to figure out the
sole survivor but I decide to run a simulation rather than looking it
up. I also decided to write it up in C++, well, really C with cout
instead of printf.
</p>
<p>
Part 1 was the traditional problem. Part 2 was a variant where at each
iteration, you remove the elf opposite the elf being processed (see
the <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/19">problem description</a> for details).
</p>
<p>
For both solutions I coded up a circular doubly linked list:
</p>
<div class="src src-c">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
You can see my complete solutions <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/advent2016/blob/master/day19.cpp">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
I was thinking about how I wrote the code – I just rolled it off the
top of my head. The same was true for the earlier AoC problems where I
had to implement a breadth first search or something similar.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not making a statement about my amazing coding abilities - linked
lists and graph searches are pretty basic, but rather than having done
the CS thing for so long, these fundamentals have become somewhat
routine. I haven&#39;t really written C code in years but other than a
couple of typos (and a stupid mistake in calculating steps) things
worked right off the bat.
</p>
<p>
I remember a time when I was in college or even a young professional
when I would use an array and an index as a stack or queue - not
because it made more sense but rather, because I wasn&#39;t fully
comfortable with memory manipulation and linked lists. The same could
be said for my first few years working with anything more than the
simplest recursion.
</p>
<p>
All of this is to say that it does get easier.
</p>
<p>
Things that seem trivial to us now seemed
insurmountable when we were beginners. Last year, I wrote about an overnight homework
assignment I gave to my class that would have been a final project a
year earlier (the post is <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-02-11-taking-stock-self-assess.html/#.WFiGl99iekA">here</a> but the homework links are no longer
active) and a few weeks ago I recall a fellow CS teacher talking about
how much longer it takes his students to write a chunk of code than it
takes the teacher.
</p>
<p>
New things are challenging and take time but with practice and
persistence techniques that were once daunting can become tools ready
at our disposal to use on a whim.
