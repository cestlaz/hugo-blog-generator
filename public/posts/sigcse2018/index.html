I just got back from SIGCSE2018 - the big annual conference on
computer science education. Although I&#39;ve been in this racket for
decades, this was only my second SIGCSE and once again I had a blast.
</p>
<p>
As with most conferences, a highlight was the &#34;hallway track&#34; where I
got to spend time with friends and colleagues from all over the
country. I also got to check off a few names from the &#34;people I&#39;ve
been following online and want to meet in person&#34; list. There are a
few more on the list but it&#39;s getting smaller.
</p>
<p>
The theme was <strong>CS For All</strong> but the range of topics covered was both
wide and deep.
</p>
<p>
For me, I left thinking about a few themes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
College faculty can learn a lot from K12 teachers in terms of
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
pedagogy and teaching.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
So can &#34;thought leaders,&#34; policy makers, and big companies.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Colleges face a huge challenge in both developing pedagogues and
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
transfering pedagogical knowledge over to researchers.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Can you do both CS4All and have quality CS teachers in the short
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
term (I doubt it)?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Researchers vs Practitioners and the value of listening to one or
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
the other.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Nifty assignments are frequently regular assignments reskinned with
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
graphics.
</p>
<p>
There were a few sessions that dissapointed me but most of the ones I
attende were terrific. I thought I&#39;d blog about some of them in detail over
the next few weeks.
</p>
<p>
Here are the sessions I&#39;m planning on writing about:
</p>

Overall it was a great conference. I look forward to sharing my
experiences with all of you in the coming posts.
