While busy finishing off my sides for my talk at CSTA2018 this weekend
I noticed a Facebook post about APCS exam grades now or shortly being
available.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m no longer teaching high school but still fancy myself a teacher
first and part of the K12CS community. We&#39;re a growing community and
we&#39;re growing fast.
</p>
<p>
Usually, at this time of year we see a number of people posting their
results. &#34;I had 16 test takers, had 5 fives, 6 fours etc.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I decided that not only won&#39;t I be congratulating anyone on their
results this year but decided to write this quick post to say no one
should.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not saying that hundreds of teachers out there don&#39;t deserve
congratulations - they do. The problem is, for everyone who&#39;s kids
got all fours and fives, somewhere out there was a teacher who
possibly through no fault of their own had students scoring ones, twos
and threes.
</p>
<p>
When I was at Stuy, almost all of my kids got fours or fives when the
exam was the old AB exam. When it went to A only, it was almost
exclusively fives with a few fours and maybe a single one. That wasn&#39;t
me. It was the kids. The AP CS teacher before me got similar results
as did all of my colleagues and the teachers who are still
there. Again, it was the kids.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s not to say that I didn&#39;t add value. I know I spent a career at
Stuy doing right by those kids regardless of test scores.
</p>
<p>
The fact is that there&#39;s only so much a teacher can do.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Was APCS (A or principles) their first course?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
What other demands are placed on the students?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
How about the teacher?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
How many kids in a class? How much time?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Is APCS an elective or required??
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Is the teacher getting the support they need?
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And the list goes on. I know some great teachers who never had classes
with great AP results and meh teachers that did. Actually, I know some
APCS and Calc teachers that consistently had classes with good scores
through drill and kill and building student speed. Of course, at the
same time these teachers totally turned the kids off from the subjects
</p>
<p>
Our teachers do deserve praise and congratulations.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Praise for getting through another year.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Praise for forging a path in this new subject area.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Praise for doing more with less.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Praise for inspiring kids and starting them on a path.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Praise for changing lives for the better.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
And so on
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If your kids left with more than they came in with you did a great job
and deserve congratulations. If you set a seed that will later grow
you&#39;ve done an enormous amount of good.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s like I would always tell my kids when they won an award. I was
never proud of them actually winning the award. I was proud of how they carried
themselves, prepared, performed or whatever. The award was just some
outsider also noticing they&#39;re awesome.
</p>
<p>
Same thing here so I won&#39;t be congratulating teachers on student test
results. The results coming in do provide some measure of closure for
the year though so I will congratulate you all on the year and your
work.
</p>
<p>
Hope to see many of you this weekend at CSTA2018.
