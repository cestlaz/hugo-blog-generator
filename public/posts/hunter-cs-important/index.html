If you know me you know that my morning reads include a visit over to
<a href="http://avc.com">avc.com</a>, Today, <a href="http://avc.com/2016/10/cranes/">Fred&#39;s post</a> talked about development and progress,
evolution, if you would, in the city. Although not directly related,
it got me thinking about gentrification.
</p>
<p>
To me, gentrification all too often seems to result in pushing out
people and business that were there during the hard times.
</p>
<p>
We don&#39;t need to force out long time residents that can no longer make
rent - we need to uplift communities with pathways to towards greater
economic opportunity.
</p>
<p>
Those of us in CS Education, each in our own way, are trying to help
build those pathways.
</p>
<p>
Return readers know that I&#39;ve ranted about some of the popular magic
bullets. I&#39;ve periodically talked about my concerns over code schools
but even at their best they represent a workforce program for the well
to do. I&#39;ve also talked about efforts like P-Tech which sound good,
but besides the fact that <a href="https://garyrubinstein.wordpress.com/2016/10/06/p-tech-principal-responds/">the emperor has no clothes</a>, is the school
really preparing kids for opportunities in their own neighborhoods or
in data centers far from home?
</p>
<p>
There are some workforce programs like <a href="https://perscholas.org/">Per Scholas</a> that I really like
and respect but they&#39;re limited in what they can do.
</p>
<p>
What does that leave us with? The traditional path – college.
</p>
<p>
In terms of tech, New York City has some amazing colleges. You ask
most people, they&#39;ll come back with NYU, Columbia. Great institutions
but <strong><strong>very</strong></strong> expensive.  Not everyone can afford $75,000 a year and
not everyone can afford to go into hundreds of thousands of debt.
</p>
<p>
This is why Hunter CS is so important. Actually CUNY but I can only
affect my little corner of the world.
</p>
<p>
Hunter College has a really nice CS program and department. It&#39;s small
and has flown under the radar but it&#39;s one of the reasons I came over
to Hunter.
</p>
<p>
One of my responsibilities at Hunter is to develop our new honors CS
program and to connect all of  Hunter CS to the tech sector in NY.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t written much about what&#39;s been going on but that will change
int the months to come. Suffice it to say that to uplift our
communities we need real, affordable educational opportunities and in
terms of tech, education that leads to real opportunities in
our city&#39;s tech sector.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m convinced that Hunter College can be a game changer for the wealth
of young talent we have in New York and for our tech sector.
