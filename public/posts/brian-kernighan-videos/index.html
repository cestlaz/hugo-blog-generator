I noticed a couple of short videos - interviews with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan">Brian Kernighan</a> -
on my YouTube home page the other day. This is probably because I
recently viewed a Kernighan video in the same series after reading
<a href="http://irreal.org/blog/?p=7327%0A">this</a> post on the history of naming grep on JCS&#39;s blog.
</p>
<p>
For you youngsters out there, CS people of my generation relied on
Brian&#39;s books &#34;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">The C Programming Language</a>&#34; and &#34;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unix_Programming_Environment">The Unix Programming
Environment</a>&#34;to get us started with C and Unix respectively.  Even
though they were both published in the 1970s I&#39;d still consider the
both as &#34;must reads.&#34; The section on software development at the end
if the Unix book is still probably one of the best written
introductions to compilers out there. I&#39;d also add a few more books he
co-authored to the &#34;must read&#34; list:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Programming_Style">The Elements of Programmign Style</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Software-Tools-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/020103669X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1532118607&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=software+tools">Software Tools</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Practice_of_Programming">The Practice of Programming</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
and I&#39;d even say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_AWK_Programming_Language">The AWK Programming Language</a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I read these books in the 80s, 90s and post 2000 so even when reading
examples using ancient Fortran, the concepts still hold up and the
writing is extremely accessible.
</p>
<p>
My Brian Kernighan story is that way back in the mid 1990s when I was
starting to design what would become Stuyvesant&#39;s intro CS course, I
sent out emails to as many &#34;thought leaders&#34; as I could get a hold of
including both professionals and academics. I cold-emailed Brian based
on a conversation I had with a former student. My former student,
Bruce, had wandered into Brian&#39;s office while in college for &#34;office
hours&#34; on a lark and ended up having a great conversation. He felt
Brian might respond.
</p>
<p>
I shot off an email and a few days later got back pages and pages of
really useful thoughts and commentary. I was blown away by the
response. Either he took some serious time to think this out and
respond to some nobody teacher cold-emailing him or he&#39;s just that
good that he can rattle off a tome length response to some random
teacher emailing him. Either way, it was a huge help. It also made an
impression so while I might fail at times, I try to be responsive when
people cold call or otherwise ask for help that I can provide.
</p>
<p>
I met Brian a number of years later at Google and in addition to being
tolerant of my fanboy-ing, I found him to just a really special
individual
</p>
<p>
Both these videos are short and I think both CS students and teachers
will find them very interesting.
