I'm a born and bred New Yorker and more and more I'm lamenting what
the city's becoming.
</p>

<p>
New York used to be a collection of neighborhoods. Yes, we were the
city that never slept, but there were scores of mom and pop stores,
sole proprieterships. You could become a "regular." I'm reminded of
Tom Shachman's book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Around-The-Block-Business-Neighborhood/dp/0151000778">Around the Block</a> which looks at the businesses
around a single NYC block, mostly all gone now. If you can get your
hands on the book. It's worth a read.
</p>

<p>
In any event, here's a story:
</p>

<p>
Yesterday. JonAlf and I were at the Apple store on Fifth avenue talking about
<a href="http://cstuy.org/">CSTUY</a>. We had four of our talented students presenting their work.
</p>

<p>
After the event, JonAlf had gone and one of our student presenters had
left with his parents. I was left with our other three presenters.
</p>

<p>
I told them that I'd love to take them by this amazing chocolate shop
a few blocks away and I had to explain why:
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
A number of years ago, after a morning in Central Park, Batya, Natan,
and I were winding our way home. We ended up passing <a href="http://www.myzels.com/">Myzel's
Chocolates</a> on the south side of 55th street between fifth and sixth
avenue. That's when we met Kamila, the shop owner. We chatted for a
while got some chocolate and went on our way. Kamila was amazingly
warm and sincere and the chocolates really really good. I noted that
we would have to return.
</p>

<p>

</p>


<p>
That didn't happen until months later but when it did, I was shocked
that Kamila remembered us, what we were doing that day and we just
picked up the conversation where we left off.
</p>

<p>
This pattern repeated over the years. We didn't get to that
neighborhood and thus Myzel's often, but whenever we did, we had to
stop by. Great candies from a truly special person.
</p>

<p>
Alas, my schedule has been such that I hadn't been back to Myzel's in
years. I think three or four.
</p>

<p>
Now, I was with Nadia, Miranda, and Leslie - three of my incredibly
talented students. They just did an awesome job presenting their work
and I figured I could give them some thank you chocolate as well as
visit one of my  favorite places in the city.
</p>

<p>
I told them that Kamila probably wouldn't remember me but I recounted
my story of Myzel's and how amazing Kamila and the store were. I got
the feeling that they didn't believe me when I told them about Kamila
and the store.
</p>

<p>
We got to Myzel's went in and started to place our order. When Kamila
came out, her first word to me was "professor&#x2026;" and we picked up
where we left off. As usual, she was charming and sincere. We
reminisced and chatted and then we were off.
</p>

<p>
In a city that's fast becoming cookie cutter we need more places like
<a href="http://www.myzels.com/">Myzel's</a> and more people like Kamila.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately rents are rapidly dispatching shops like <a href="http://www.myzels.com/">Myzel's</a> and
people like Kamila are few and far between.
</p>

<p>
So, when you're around City Center or midtown in general, please treat
yourself. You won't be disappointed.
