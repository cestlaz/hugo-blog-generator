Back in April, I was at the second annual "Dream It, Code It, Win It!"
awards. Some of our kids had submitted work and were selected as
awardees in the high school division.
</p>

<p>
It was great to see <a href="https://twitter.com/Cahnja">Jack</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/davcahn">David</a> Cahn there. Jack and David were
both members of winning high school teams last year and they were back
as college winners this time around.
</p>

<p>
It was great to see them.
</p>

<p>
The Cahn brothers spent some time talking to the current crop. They
mentioned one thing that really confirmed that I've been on the right
track with my SoftDev class - they said it was their most valuable
experiece at Stuy because they learned how to ship a product. To take
something, as a team, from idea to delivery with all the bumps along
the way. Now, obviously, we don't do everything - there are no
questions of funding for instance and I think we cover a lot of great
CS but giving the kids a chance to learn to take a project from idea
to delivery and all that entails was a big part of the design of the
course.
</p>

<p>
With that in mind, I just finished evaluating projects and here's a
sampling:

Stuy kids live all over the city. Nadia, Aida, and Sydney solved the
problem of where to meet your friends when you live on opposite sides
of town:

Not a SoftDev project, but for good measure, here's Natan and
Angelika's Ballroom Dance project - apparently they're the first two
to actually do a SONG and dance and they've both got the pipes:

There were lots of other great projects all up on github:

rather disorganized form.

So proud of the work they all did this year.
