In the New York City department of education a recurring hot topic is
the Absent Teacher Reserve or ATR pool.
</p>
<p>
A teacher or administrator in the ATR pool is a licensed, most likely
tenured teacher not assigned permanently to a school. Each year these
educators get shuttled from school to school and denied a chance to
actually settle in a position.
</p>
<p>
The ATR pool was created under the Bloomberg administration. Prior to
that, when there was an opening school transfers were basically
seniority based and when school had too many teachers the least senior
was excessed or basically out of a job until a school with an opening
could be found. The Bloomberg plan allowed teachers to use criteria
other than seniority for transfers but so as not to violate the
contract agreed to by both parties, teachers who were excessed, as
they might not be least senior, were kept on as employees and put in
the pool.
</p>
<p>
ATR&#39;s would rotate from school to school. Sometimes for a couple of
week but more recently for a year at a time. When at a school for only
a couple of weeks they could only be used as subs or for grunt work
but even when there for a year they&#39;re treated like second class
citizens.
</p>
<p>
The ATR pool grew in size when the Bloomberg/Klein DOE went on the war
path, set schools up to fail and closed them left and right. If you
had the bad luck being at a close out school when it closed then, hello
ATR pool.
</p>
<p>
Over the years, the press, ed reformers and politicians have unfairly
bashed this group of educators. They&#39;ve falsely claimed that these are
criminal teachers or unsatisfactory teachers. That&#39;s a blatant
lie. Teachers up on charges are removed from schools and await a
hearing in another draconian process set up to violate teacher&#39;s
rights. If a teacher is ultimately found guilty, they are disciplined
or fired. If exonerated, they&#39;re returned to their schools. In any
case they&#39;re not ATRs. Teachers that are repeatedly found to be
unsatisfactory are likewise removed (although the process here is
ridiculous and unfair as well).
</p>
<p>
ATRs like any pool of teachers run the gamut. Some are great, some are
poor, many will fall in between. All are stigmatized and treated like
damaged goods.
</p>
<p>
People ask, how can a good teacher get into the ATR pool? As I said,
be at a closeout school. In the year before I was able to bring my friend
and former colleague JonAlf over to Stuy, he was at Brandeis High
School - a
closeout school. I tried to bring him over that year but his principal
wouldn&#39;t release him. Had I not been successful in bringing him over
the following year he might very well have ended up in the ATR pool
and he&#39;s one of the best teachers I know. What about the teacher that
doesn&#39;t want to abandon those kids that the DOE abandoned when they
decided to close the school. That martyr teacher surely ends up in the
ATR pool but that&#39;s the type of dedicated teacher every principal
should want.
</p>
<p>
So now we have a bunch of stigmatized teachers looking for work in a
system that won&#39;t give them a chance. Not only due to them being
considered &#34;damaged goods&#34; but also because they&#39;re expensive to
hire.
</p>
<p>
When a school gets an ATR to them, it&#39;s free - the cost isn&#39;t added to
their budget - they keep them as extra manpower for the year and then
throw them out with the trash. At times, they get some credit for
keeping them a second year and even beyond they can get rid of them
whenever they want. Great way to bust the contract.
</p>
<p>
A clear example of this is Stuy&#39;s  current math chair. He&#39;s an ATR
Assistant Principal. They got him for free for the first year and I
believe at a 50% discount for the second and even now they can dump
him whenever they want. This is rubbish – he&#39;s either good enough for
the position or he&#39;s not. If he is, he should be given the job for
real and if he isn&#39;t then what is he still doing there. I&#39;m not making
any value judgment on him or the department but it&#39;s either one or the
other.
</p>
<p>
So, a big reason for this ATR mess is about budgets and money. The
problem is that it&#39;s a big lie.
</p>
<p>
The DOE pretends the we have a situation like this:
</p>
<img src="/img/atr1.png" alt="/img/atr1.png" title="/img/atr1.png" align="center" height="250"/>
<p>
The DOE has money and schools have money. The schools pay for their
teachers, supplies, and everything else but the ATRS are paid for by
the DOE. Of course this isn&#39;t the case. The truth is that the DOE pays
for everything:
</p>
<img src="/img/atr2.png" alt="/img/atr2.png" title="/img/atr2.png" align="center" height="250"/>
<p>
ALL the money comes from the DOE.
</p>
<p>
In the past the DOE has come up with poorly conceived and poorly
received plans on how to deal with the ATR situation but it&#39;s really
quite simple.
</p>
<p>
Start by recognizing that ALL the money comes from the DOE. Once you
do that you can address the problem:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Assign the ATR to a school
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If the school likes the ATR and the ATR likes the school, they keep
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
them and the DOE picks up the tab or rather adjusts the schools
budget to compensate. The DOE will continue to do so until a real
opening occurs at the school in the ATR&#39;s area at which point the
ATR fills the position officially and the budget is readjusted.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
If the school or ATR don&#39;t like each other the ATR gets rotated,
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
however you create a 3 strikes (or maybe 2 or 4 or some number)
rule.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
If the school keeps sending away ATRs semester after semester hit
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
them with a penalty or force an ATR placement when they have an
opening (assuming the ATR is amenable).
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
If the ATR keeps declining positions after a set number of
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
schools force the placement.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s it. Simple and solves the problem.
