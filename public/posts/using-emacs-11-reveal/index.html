Happy to be back after a couple of weeks.
</p>
<p>
My wife and son spent some time in San Francisco, Mountain View, and
Seattle. The main reason was to see our daughter who&#39;s interning out
there for the summer but it was also a great opportunity to catch up
with over 100 former students. If you&#39;re interested in seeing more, I
wrote a bit about it <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/end-to-act-1/#.V45OGt9vGAk">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
I was originally going to start talking about Python development but
then saw <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/4sp0xs/emacs_org_mode_and_revealjs/">this</a> post on reddit about <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/">reveal.js</a> and using it with
org-mode. Since reveal.js with org-mode  is my goto presentation tool
I thought I&#39;d do a video on that before getting back to &#34;your
regularly schedueld program.&#34;
</p>
  <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/psDpCpcIVYs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>
The main package you have to use for reveal.js presentations in
org-mode is org-reveal. The package to install is <strong><strong>ox-reveal</strong></strong>. I also
installed <strong><strong>htmlize</strong></strong> for syntax highlighting. Here&#39;s the code from
our configuration file:
</p>
<div class="src src-emacs-lisp">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-emacs-lisp" data-lang="emacs-lisp"><div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-emacs-lisp" data-lang="emacs-lisp">(use-package ox-reveal
:ensure ox-reveal)

(setq org-reveal-root <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/reveal.js/3.0.0/&#34;</span>)
(setq org-reveal-mathjax <span style="color:#66d9ef">t</span>)

(use-package htmlize
:ensure <span style="color:#66d9ef">t</span>)</code></pre></div></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
The org-reveal-root setq tells your presentation where to find the
reveal.js code. In this example, we&#39;re getting from the cloud. You can
also install it locally.
</p>
<p>
The org-reveal-mathjax is just so that LaTeX equations will look nice.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m hoping the video is pretty self-explanitory and the org-reveal
<a href="https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal%0A">home page</a> is pretty thorough but since the documentation is lagging a
bit behind the code and due to some versioning issues, here are a
couple of things to watch out for:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
I made a <strong><strong>samples</strong></strong> folder where I&#39;ll put code for this series that
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
isn&#39;t part of the configurations.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
I showed <strong><strong>:frag (roll-in)</strong></strong> as an example of revealing list items
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
one at a time. Those parens are important and are needed but weren&#39;t
in earlier versions - this took me far too long to figure out.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
If you read the docs you&#39;ll see that there are many more transitions
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
and you can mix and match them on a page.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
You might have to upgrade your emacs packages. If you
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong><strong>list-packages</strong></strong>  in eamcs it will tell you if you have packages to
upgrade. You mark them for upgrading by typing <strong><strong>U</strong></strong> and then do the
upgrade with <strong><strong>x</strong></strong>. If this doesn&#39;t work, you can try getting rid fo
the <strong><strong>elpa</strong></strong> folder and then re-installing.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The <a href="http://github.com/zamansky/mazelesson">mazelesson</a> sample presentation shows more features, many that we
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
haven&#39;t covered yet. Check it out but remember that it&#39;s for an
earlier version of org-reveal.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Github pages and rawgit are cool.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hope you enjoy this. Please add any reveal.js tips and tricks of your
own.
