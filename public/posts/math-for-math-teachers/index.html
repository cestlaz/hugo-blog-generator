Last Thursday I attended an event - the release of &#34;Priming the
Computer Science Teacher Pump: Integrating CS Education into Schools
of Ed.&#34; <a href="https://twitter.com/guzdial">Mark Guzdial</a> wrote about it <a href="https://computinged.wordpress.com/2018/04/16/finding-a-home-for-cs-ed-in-schools-of-ed-priming-the-cs-teacher-pump-report-released/">here</a>. You can also download the
actual report <a href="http://www.computingteacher.org/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
I agree with a number of the challenges in creating CS teacher
preparation programs that were outlined in the report and I also agree
with the idea that a strong CS teacher preparation program should
prepare teachers to teach any (and in the case of the programs I
designed, create new) curriculum but I wanted to focus on one specific
item that was brought up last Thursday. The item deals with how much
CS content a K12 CS teacher actually needs.
</p>
<p>
The speaker at the event - I forget which one pointed out that a K12
CS teacher doesn&#39;t need the same content knowledge as a full CS major
let alone graduate student. This is something I wholeheartedly agree
with. The speakers throughout the event also emphasized that CS
teachers need enough content knowledge to be &#34;generalists&#34; and teach
any reasonable CS experience. Again, a point on which I agree.
</p>
<p>
The point that concerned me - not in terms of the presenters intent
but rather in how I feel things will play out was when the presenter
said something to the affect (and I&#39;m paraphrasing here):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Math teachers don&#39;t need the same level of math content knowledge as
math majors. That&#39;s why we have &#34;math for math teachers.&#34;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I was immediately reminded of a conversation I had once with a
colleague. He was looking over a student&#39;s college transcript and
noticed a course &#34;Math for Math Teachers&#34; and thought, &#34;I always
thought that it was just math!!!!!&#34;
</p>
<p>
To many teachers, titles like &#34;Calculus for Math Teachers&#34; like
those similar courses &#34;Calculus for Poets&#34; or, the famous &#34;Math
for Trees&#34; are code for watered down math for non-math majors courses. From what I can
gather many of these courses are more Math Ed courses than Math but
offered through a school&#39;s Mathematics Department rather than through
an Ed school or department. They make sure that candidates  fill the &#34;enough graduate
math credits&#34; bucket. Everyone goes along with a nod and a wink and
life moves on. I want to emphasize that there&#39;s nothing inherently bad
with many of these courses - many are quite good but they&#39;re content
heavy education courses masquerading as pure content courses.
</p>
<p>
I managed to avoid doing any of that in my programs current design but
I did have to add a graduate algorithms class that I&#39;m not entirely
happy with - I feel that it&#39;s requiring a level of depth that K12 CS
teachers will never  need.
</p>
<p>
Across all subject areas we should just acknowledge that K12 teachers
don&#39;t need a huge amount of graduate subject area credits. In my view,
teachers need depth a bit beyond the most advanced core course their
students will take and a good deal of breadth. Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if
we didn&#39;t have to play this song and dance this dance of creating
&#34;special&#34; subject courses for teachers.
</p>
<p>
The real thing to watch out for is how this is already playing out in
computer science. Colleges are starting to offer classes for K12
computer science teachers. I&#39;ve seen a few course descriptions and
syllabi and spoken to a number of people involved with some of these
classes. It&#39;s typical to see something like &#34;Java Programming for CS
Teachers&#34; as opposed to a &#34;first in CS sequence programming course
using Java.&#34; Look  under the hood and you&#39;ll find it&#39;s really &#34;APCS-A
for teachers&#34; - not creating a generalist teacher but rather  taking
us right back to preparing them to ape specific curricula and
sequences.
</p>
<p>
We can do better.
