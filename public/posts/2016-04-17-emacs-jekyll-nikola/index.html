Switched over from <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> yesterday.
</p>
<p>
One of the primary reasons was that I got fed up with managing a Ruby
development environment across all my machines. In spite of my
rantings, I&#39;m sure Ruby and Ruby installs are fine - it&#39;s just
something that I&#39;d have to deal with on a recurring basis for one
specific task - other than for Jekyll blogging, I don&#39;t use Ruby.
</p>
<p>
So while a platform based on Python - generally my go to language,
made sense, the other driving force for the switch was the fact that
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> and <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> have become such major parts of my workflow and
productivity.
</p>
<p>
What do I use org-mode for?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
lesson planning
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
document preparation (instead of LaTeX)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
note taking
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
blogging
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
email (with mu4e)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
managing my schedule
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
tracking bookmarks
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
and probably a lot more.
</p>
<p>
Jekyll is actually a really nice tool. It&#39;s simple. You put together a
simple directory structure: Templates in _layouts, blog posts in
_posts, drafts in _drafts. Other directories that start with an
underscore are ignored and everything else is copied up to your site.
</p>
<p>
I love that it&#39;s &#34;close to the metal&#34; You can put in html files with
some meta information up top or markdown.
</p>
<p>
You can take a look at my old site at
<a href="https://github.com/cestlaz/cestlaz.github.io-jekyll"><a href="https://github.com/cestlaz/cestlaz.github.io-jekyll">https://github.com/cestlaz/cestlaz.github.io-jekyll</a></a> if you want to
take a look.
</p>
<p>
The beauty is that you just push your files up to GitHub and it
automatically runs Jekyll and builds your site (<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/">more info here</a>).
</p>
<p>
The problem is that Jekyll doesn&#39;t play well with org-mode and
org-markup so my workflow became something like this
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Create a post <strong><strong>something.org</strong></strong> in the _org directory.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
From within emacs, publish it. I&#39;ve configured org-mode to publish
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
by exporting the org-mode markup file to html and saving it in the
_drafts directory.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
If it looks good, copy and rename the file from _drafts to the
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
_posts directory and push it up to GitHub.
</p>
<p>
A little clunky, but it works. The bigger problem was the amount of
time I&#39;d spend putting html blocks into my org formatted posts to get
them to look the way I wanted (or at least close enough).
</p>
<p>
Enter Nikola.
</p>
<p>
Nikola&#39;s a much more powerful tool. It does much more but as a result
is much more complex. Normally, that&#39;s not my style but in this case
since It&#39;s Python, things balance out.
</p>
<p>
I still have to figure out the entire templating system and all the
plugins but getting started was pretty quick.
</p>
<p>
The big win is that Nikola supports a ton of formats for your posts
and pages. Native org-mode support for me was what did it for me. On top of
that, although I haven&#39;t tested it yet, is that there&#39;s also an
org-mode plugin to export to Nikola restructure text.
</p>
<p>
My new workflow:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Write the post as an org-mode file.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
run <strong><strong>nikola github_{}deploy</strong></strong>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
And that&#39;s it. You can look at my Nikola site here:
<a href="https://github.com/cestlaz/cestlaz.github.io"><a href="https://github.com/cestlaz/cestlaz.github.io">https://github.com/cestlaz/cestlaz.github.io</a></a>.
The source code is in the <strong><strong>src</strong></strong> branch, the actual rendered blog in
the <strong><strong>master</strong></strong> branch.
</p>
<p>
So far, I&#39;m pretty happy with the setup.
