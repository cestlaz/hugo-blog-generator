I'm moving to a new blogging platform. I'm still going to use GitHub
pages but after a few years of using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, I'm switching to <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a>.
</p>

<p>
I think I've got the move worked out but if you're reading this via an
rss or atom reader, make sure to check back in a couple of days - you
might have to re-subscribe.
</p>

<p>
Why am I switching?
</p>

<p>
Because I hate Ruby.
</p>

<p>
Ok, not really - I barely know the language. I was already a  Python
guy when Ruby came along and I didn't see any real added value to
switching.
</p>

<p>
This isn't really about Ruby though, it's really about how that which
we don't know is strange and frightening. In this case, the ruby ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
I started using Jekyll because that's what was supported by GitHub
pages. It's fairly simple and it basically worked. It had a few
warts, specifically, I've had problems getting org-mode blog posts to
publish just the way I'd like and it's hard to debug when a post has
some bad markup in it, but it got the job done.
</p>

<p>
Recently, though, I've had to re-install Jekyll a number of  times and
for me, that's been a nightmare.
</p>

<p>
One is supposed to just be able to <b><b>sudo gem install jekyll</b></b>.
</p>

<p>
Ok, so you need some packages installed:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo apt-get install ruby-dev
</pre></div>

<p>
But I've got ruby 1.9 and I need ruby 2 point something. Ok:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo apt-get install ruby2.0 ruby2.0-dev
</pre></div>

<p>
But that fails since we're still running 1.9. Every time I look for a
solution I go down the ruby ecosystem rabbit hole.
</p>

<p>
All I want is Jekyll!!!!!!
</p>

<p>
Why can't I just <b><b>pip install jekyll</b></b> like I can do with Python
packages!!!!!
</p>

<p>
In truth, there's nothing wrong with the ruby ecosystem, It's just
something I'm not familiar with. I probably had to go through the same
battles with Python it's just that I did them incrementally over time.
</p>

<p>
The truth is, setting up a development environment should be much
easier. It used to be that I installed Linux, it had C installed and I
just had to install <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">make</a>. Now it's all about tool chains, virtual
environments, containers, and more.
</p>

<p>
I think this is what <a href="https://twitter.com/roybahat">Roy</a> was talking about when we traded
tweets on using development environments in an  <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2016/04/12/ide-or-cloud.html#.Vw_nPN9vETt">Ide or in the cloud</a>.
</p>

<p>
If it's hard for me to get an environment running, imagine some poor
soul who just went through a "learn to code" web site and now has to
figure out how to set up his or her own machine!!!!!!
</p>

<p>
I don't have a solution but at least it hasn't stopped me and others
from trying new things.
</p>

<p>
Two of my CS blogging friends, <a href="https://gflint.wordpress.com/">Garth Flint</a> and <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/">Alfred Thompson</a> have in
their own ways talked about this same issue. Garth, showing a bias
towards VB yet still working to get his head around Python. Alfred
shows the same disdain for Linux and the command line as I show
towards Windows. All this leads to valuable learning experiences and
discussions.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I'm also going through this battle as I continue to
explore Clojure.
</p>

<p>
So, I'm going to finish the changeover to Nikola in the next day or
two. Remember to check back in case the feeds aren't working.
</p>

<p>
Once I make the change, I'll talk about Jekyll vs Nikola as actual
blogging platforms.
