            <p>Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of people talk about curriculum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need a curriculum that works for everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we had a good curriculum, we could get CS in the schools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you just take someone else&rsquo;s curriculum and scale things out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>People miss the point. In my twenty some odd years as an educator and
my forty five  as a human (including 18 as a parent), I&rsquo;ve <em>never</em>
heard someone talk about <em>that one inspirational curriculum</em> that made
all the difference in their lives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about the curriculum, it&rsquo;s about the teacher.</p>
<p>The collegeboard web site provides some sample AP Computer Science A
syllabi. In them, you&rsquo;ll find things like:</p>
<p>mergesort</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Students will gain additional practice with arrays as they explore the
nontrivial task of merging two sorted lists. In addition, students
will once again see a comparison between a recursive and
nonrecursive solution to an algorithm&hellip;.</p>
<p>Technically, this covers what has to be taught and what will be on the
AP exam but it really misses the point.</p>
<p>I blogged about a few lessons I taught last year. One here:</p>
<p><a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2013/03/23/Who_won_the_election-Quadratic_to_Linear_Time.html#.UgLhfN__umg">http://cestlaz.github.io/2013/03/23/Who_won_the_election-Quadratic_to_Linear_Time.html#.UgLhfN__umg</a></p>
<p>and here:</p>
<p><a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2012/12/17/layers-of-a-lesson.html#.UgLhi9__umg">http://cestlaz.github.io/2012/12/17/layers-of-a-lesson.html#.UgLhi9__umg</a></p>
<p>The first topic might have a line in the syllabus saying: Finding the mode
of a data set and have a description talking about using lists. None of
the beauty of the topic is captured in the syllabus. That&rsquo;s all the
teacher.</p>
<p>Similar things can be said about the second lesson.</p>
<p>The NY State Common Core Math Curriculum does a little better (not
that I&rsquo;m sold on it) - for example, it doesn&rsquo;t just say &ldquo;Quadratic
Formula&rdquo; but at least says that it should be derived. It&rsquo;s better, but
not by much.</p>
<p>In my experience, Curricula are least common denominator documents and
centering education around them rather than teachers is a huge
mistake.</p>
<p>A great teacher can inspire and mask a bad curriculum. The reverse isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>Likewise, a bad curriculum can do more to constrain a good teacher than
a good curriculum can help a bad teacher to inspire.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, I&rsquo;ve met a few CS teachers that really
impressed me as teachers but not course designers. I found there
courses and curricula sorely lacking, but the fact that they had the
gift allowed them to truly inspire their students.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not to say that good class design and curriculum
aren&rsquo;t important &ndash; those same teachers would be even better with a
better course framework but it has to start with the teaching talent.</p>
<p>Why am I writing about this? Because more and more we see the
marginalization of teachers. We see the TFA 5 week training model or
summer workshops to create or train new teachers. The theory seems to
be, it we script the teaching, this will be sufficient. It might be,
if the goal is to get by standardized tests, but it won&rsquo;t be if the
goal is to have an inspirational knowledgeable teacher in front of our
kids.</p>
<p>For that we have to start with the talent and develop the curriculum
around it.</p>
