I&#39;m way behind on my <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/">Communications of the ACM</a>. I generally only read
them when I use my trainer in the mornings and with summer running and
outside riding, I&#39;m still on the December 2015 issue.
</p>
<p>
This morning, I read a viewpoint by Jeremy Scott and Alan Bundy on <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/12/194638-creating-a-new-generation-of-computational-thinkers/abstract">a
program in Scotland</a>. If you&#39;re an ACM member, and if you&#39;re a CS
practitioner, student, academic, or teacher you should be, you can read the piece for details.
</p>
<p>
Me? I noticed a number of similarities between what Bundy and Scott
described and efforts here in the USA including some of the red flags.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not here to talk about the program described in detail or their
successes and failures. I don&#39;t have enough information to fairly
comment on that. I&#39;m here in my usual role of curmudgeon to highlight
common red flags that if unheeded could cost all of us the opportunity
to get really great CS Ed to all of our students.
</p>
<p>
One red flag right away were a number of references to the program
being curriculum and materials driven, not teacher driven. The
viewpoint states that materials &#34;were designed to be used by even
non-specialist teachers.&#34; We see the same thing here in the USA and
not just in CS Ed. Teaching overall is being devalued with the elite
pushing programs that handcuff good teachers to a script (which leads
students towards &#34;success&#34; in passing a nonsense standardized exam)
all the while sending their own kids to elite private schools with
knowledgeable teachers.
</p>
<p>
I know i didn&#39;t want my kids to be taught chemistry history or any
other subject by a teacher that hasn&#39;t studied the content yet here we
go saying it&#39;s okay for CS.
</p>
<p>
The counter argument is that we have to do something now and we&#39;ll do
better later. We all go in with the best of intentions but more often
than not, once a politician has their sound bite and once a cheap
apparent solution is in place, it&#39;s good enough and we&#39;re done. I
ranted about that a while back both <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-03-04-expedient-vs-good.html/#.V-5UqN9vGAk">here</a> and <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-07-learning-takes-time.html/#.V-5Uot9vGAk">here</a>. To their credit,
Bundy and Scott talk a bit about this concern in the piece.
</p>
<p>
The piece also said &#34;It is also necessary to employ a pedagogy that is
informed by the latest research into the most effective ways to teach
computing.&#34; This sounds good but the truth is, education research
doesn&#39;t have the best reputation among educators. Last month, I
asked one of the best math teachers around what was being bandied
about as best practices in math education according to &#34;the
research?&#34; He basically said &#34;the research says do <strong><strong>fad du jour</strong></strong>
but that doesn&#39;t work for me so I just do <strong><strong>actually good technique</strong></strong>.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Over the years, I&#39;ve spoken to many teachers and by and large the best
ones discredit &#34;the research.&#34; Of course, my comment will be
discredited by ed researchers saying that &#34;you&#39;re just giving
anecdotes&#34; but then, if I did the same thing while employed as a
researcher, did a couple of surveys and submitted it for publication,
then it would be &#34;research.&#34; So much of teaching is a craft and the
truth is, practitioners know best.
</p>
<p>
Related to this is authentication by citing authority. Particularly
dangerous in our field because many people with little to no real
background in teaching CS are anointed as experts and thought leaders
(see this post: <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-10-26-self-appointed-experts.html/">here</a>). In this case, the viewpoint cites Cameron
Fadjo. I&#39;ve only met Cameron once or twice and he seems like a sharp
guy but when he was given the post of Director of Software Engineering
for NYC, according to his linked in profile, he had neither taught k12
nor had any real CS background.  This is of course the profile of many
CS Education thought leaders.
</p>
<p>
My overall take. It sounds like just like here, Scotland has people
trying to make a difference and trying to do good. It also sounds like
they&#39;re falling into the same traps and pitfalls as we are on this
side of the Atlantic.
