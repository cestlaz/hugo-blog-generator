            <p>People keep asking me about how we&rsquo;re doing with respect to gender
balance and CS education at Stuy.</p>
<p>Rather than writing the same email again and again, I figured I&rsquo;d summarize things here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done rather well at Stuy. I might write more in depth at some
point in the future but we don&rsquo;t dumb anything down and we aren&rsquo;t
patronizing. I think much of the success can be attributed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Awesome teachers that really know their CS and are great teachers.</li>
<li>Teachers that buy into the same insanity.</li>
<li>Well designed courses in a well designed sequence.</li>
<li>A well designed <strong>required</strong> intro course where young ladies can see that this stuff is cool and women are just as good at it as men.</li>
<li>Did I mention awesome teachers.</li>
<li>An atmosphere where everyone feels accepted.</li>
</ul>
<p>An important fact to consider here is that Stuyvesant is only <strong>40%
female</strong> so our numbers are actually even better than they
appear. Also, we&rsquo;ve typically offered AP CS to 150 students and our
senior classes to between 60 and 120 students. Even with these
numbers, we&rsquo;re always over subscribed (it&rsquo;s not uncommon to have 300 - 400 students out of a class of about 800 students request AP Computer Science).</p>

<p>You might wonder why I included the C Physics numbers. Of all the
other STEM AP classes, C Physics is probably the most analagous to AP
Comp Sci.</p>
<ul>
<li>Both are electives that are traditionally male dominated.</li>
<li>Both follow a required class in an earlier grade.</li>
<li>Neither is a graduation requirement,</li>
<li>but C Physics can fulfill one of Stuyvesant&rsquo;s senior science elective requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t look at Calculus because at
Stuy, Calc is just &ldquo;the next math course&rdquo; so just students take it
regardless of gender.</p>
<p>Another difference is that AP CS is offered mostly to juniors and that
the students have additional classes they can take in their senior
year.</p>
<p>Notice that Stuy CS outperforms the national gender breakdown while
Stuy C Physics doesn&rsquo;t. The point is that it&rsquo;s not a Stuy thing, it&rsquo;s
something we&rsquo;re doing in our little CS corner of the world.</p>
<p>Another interesting morsel is that we recently had our <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2013/06/27/Demo_Night.html#.UdXzVaBtw7w">demo night</a>. There
were 13 combined students on the four winning teams. 6 were young
ladies so women were in no way dominated in our most advanced class.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. What&rsquo;s going on with gender and CS at Stuy.</p>
