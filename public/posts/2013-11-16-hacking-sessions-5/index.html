<p>Week 5.</p>
<p>Last week, I lamented over the difficulties with only meeting once a
week. We went over a log of new material last week and I was happy
when today rolled around and the hackers would be able to start
putting things together.</p>
<p>When writing a web app, you&rsquo;ve got to know about all sorts of things -
for us it&rsquo;s HTML, CSS, Python, and the microframework,
<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">flask</a>. That&rsquo;s quite a bit, particularly when
working with a group with a wide range of experience coming in.</p>
<p>So, what did we do? We put together two partial web sites.</p>
<p>One had all the Python code, but was missing the HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>The other had the HTML and CSS, but the Python logic was all missing.</p>
<p>It was our hacker&rsquo;s mission to fill in the missing pieces.</p>
<p>We liked the setup for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each Hacker came in with different strengths and weaknesses. With this project, they could start with something they knew (picking the part with the &ldquo;hard part&rdquo; filled in) and then moving to a more challenging piece.</li>
<li>By looking at the other half of the project, they could find sample code for the pieces they were working on.</li>
<li>The hackers also had last weeks code as a reference.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also introduced the hackers to pair programming - something I love
from a pedagogical point of view - but more on that in another post.</p>
<p>Overall I think the day went very well.</p>
<p>We also gave out our first assignment &ndash; over the weeks, the hackers
will finish up their projects - next week we&rsquo;ll demo and give prizes
for the best.</p>
