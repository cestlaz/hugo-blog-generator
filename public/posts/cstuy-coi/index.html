The difficulties I&#39;ve had with the city and DOE are pretty well
documented by now.
</p>
<p>
Today I&#39;m going to tell you about my latest dealings with DOE and how
they prevented my team from bringing free quality CS education to city
students.
</p>
<p>
CSTUY&#39;s not running SHIP, its summer program this year.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s not something I&#39;m happy about but part of me knew it might
happen. What did surprise me, although it shouldn&#39;t have, was the role that
the NYC DOE played in preventing it from happening.
</p>
<p>
The bottom line initial reason for us not running SHIP this summer
was my time. Moving over to my new position at Hunter has
been terrific but I haven&#39;t had the time needed for adequate
fundraising and outreach.
</p>
<p>
I recently talked a bit about the difficulties we&#39;ve had with
fundraising as compared to the &#34;chosen programs&#34; in
<a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-04-10-thought-leaders/#.VyKAnh9vH0o">this post</a>.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also written a bit about related issues in these posts:

</h2>
<p>
In any event, we weren&#39;t going to be able to run this summer.
</p>
<p>
When I spoke to the team, Sam asked, &#34;if we can keep the budget down
and figure out how to not be dependent on fundraising and outreach, can
we do something?&#34; I told him, I&#39;d love to.
</p>
<p>
He came up with a plan. Instead of a full day program, we&#39;d run half
day - this means fewer staff hours and no lunch. If we could run it at
Stuyvesant, in the computer labs (which already run Linux), we
wouldn&#39;t have to worry about equipment.
</p>
<p>
Under this plan, additional fundraising wasn&#39;t needed, in fact, kids
could attend free of charge.
</p>
<p>
In terms of outreach, since we already had sufficient funds, even if
we only got returning shipmates and a few from word of mouth we&#39;d be
ok and if we could cast a wider net, so much the better.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and the plan was for me to take the summer off. I&#39;d help with
initial organization but I wouldn&#39;t actually work the summer.
</p>
<p>
So, to summarize:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Free for the kids
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I&#39;m not involved and receive no compensation for the summer (this is
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
important for later)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
My teachers would be paid for teaching in the program and CSTUY
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
would supply the funds to pay them.
</p>
<p>
We floated the idea to Stuyvesant&#39;s principal figuring that since
the teaching staff is from there and some of the kids tat would
benefit are Stuy students it wouldn&#39;t be a problem. She said she loved
the idea but had to send it off to the conflict of interests people.
</p>
<p>
You see, it&#39;s very important that teachers and former teachers don&#39;t
actually benefit from working extra – it&#39;s critical that teachers be
kept down.
</p>
<p>
Long story short - the teachers could work the program but aren&#39;t
allowed to run it. They can come in and teach but can&#39;t talk to the
principal about organizing it. For some reason, running a <strong><strong>free</strong></strong>
program for kids instead of relaxing over the summer means that the
teachers are getting this <strong><strong>huge</strong></strong> benefit. Sure they&#39;d be paid for
their time, but that seems fair.
</p>
<p>
As to me, I&#39;m not allowed any dealings with the DOE for a year. Forget
the fact that I wanted to set this up while taking <strong><strong>no</strong></strong> pay so that
the kids wouldn&#39;t be left without a program. Nope, that&#39;s no good -
can&#39;t have us bringing quality CS education to the kids.
</p>
<p>
I dealt with these folks once before so I wasn&#39;t really surprised.
</p>
<p>
A few years ago, a friend connected me with people at Amplify
to see about creating their APCS MOOC. We met a couple of times but
then the DOE people said I couldn&#39;t work with them even though I was
just going to be working on the MOOC and not dealing directly with the
DOE in any way. I wasn&#39;t negotiating contracts, making sales pitches,
or anything. I was just going to work on MOOC content.
</p>
<p>
It wasn&#39;t like a certain NYC School&#39;s Chancellor who had just left the DOE and
took the leadership position at Amplify. That wasn&#39;t a conflict - I
guess it&#39;s just important to keep the teachers in line - the rules
aren&#39;t meant for the higher ups.
</p>
<p>
Funny side note – when I shared the fact that I couldn&#39;t work for
Amplify with my friend, his first reaction was &#34;because of the union?&#34;
That seems to be the knee-jerk reaction from people in the business
world. Nope - the union was fine with it - it was the administration /
city. The city has done <strong><strong>far</strong></strong> more harm to the public schools than
the union ever could. Pretty much all the union does is make sure the
city follows the jointly negotiated contract.
</p>
<p>
Back to the story.
</p>
<p>
So, we&#39;re not allowed to use school space to bring free CS education
to kids this summer. Plenty of other organizations non-profit and
for-profit alike seem to have no problem bringing their programs into
the schools. I&#39;m sure many are getting money for this, grant based or
otherwise. In all cases, I&#39;d take my team and their program over what
the DOE is actually rolling out.
</p>
<p>
This is the type of thing makes me want to say to hell with DOE but,
unfortunately, they aren&#39;t affected, it&#39;s the kids that lose out.
