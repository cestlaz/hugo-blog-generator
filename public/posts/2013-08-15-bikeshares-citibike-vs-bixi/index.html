Love the city - it&rsquo;s walkable, lots of good food, love the waterfront, history, and lots to do.
I also love seeing a city using a bike/walking combo. In a car, you speed by things too fast and parking&rsquo;s always a problem. Foot alone doesn&rsquo;t let you cover enough ground. By bike, you&rsquo;re slow enough to see things but fast enough to get from place to place." />

            <p>We just got back from a few days in Montreal.</p>
<p>Love the city - it&rsquo;s walkable, lots of good food, love the waterfront,
history, and lots to do.</p>
<p>I also love seeing a city using a bike/walking combo. In a car, you
speed by things too fast and parking&rsquo;s always a problem. Foot alone
doesn&rsquo;t let you cover enough ground. By bike, you&rsquo;re slow enough to
see things but fast enough to get from place to place.</p>
<p>Last time, we brought our own bikes for the trip. These time, we used
the Bixi bike share. Here are some thoughts comparing their system
with our Citibike system. It&rsquo;s not really a fair comparison. In NY I
use it alone for shopping and meetings and in Montreal, it was a
family of 4 tourists. Still, I found some things interesting.</p>
<h3 id="our-trips">Our trips</h3>
<p>On our first day, we rode from our place to the <a href="http://espacepourlavie.ca/en/botanical-garden">Botanical
Gardens</a>. Between 7 and
8 kilometers. They had a pretty amazing exhibition going on:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Last time, we brought our own bikes. The biggest
difference - we didn&rsquo;t have to schlep locks. Maybe not a big deal if
you&rsquo;re taking little piddly locks, but when you&rsquo;re taking
<a href="http://www.abus.com/eng/Mobile-Security/Bike-safety-and-security/Locks/Lock-chain-combination/CityChain-1010">these</a>
and
<a href="http://www.kryptonitelock.com/Pages/ProductInformation.aspx?PNumber=999492">these</a>
it&rsquo;s a big deal. It&rsquo;s really nice to be able take a bike and not have
to carry anything else, even though we did bring our own helmets.</p>
<p>On the other hand, between the time it took to check out all four
bikes, a leisurely pace, and the timing of traffic lights, the ride
took about 50 minutes. That meant that we had to swap out bikes once
in the middle and wait two minutes between. Not a huge deal, but a
little annoying. The 45 minutes that subscribers of both systems get
seems to be a much sweeter spot. I know, 50 minutes is still more than
45, but at 30, by the time we check out four bikes and are ready to
go, the first bike already has almost 5 minutes on it.</p>
<p>During the second day, we took the bikes down to the waterfront and
spent most of the day there. It was about a 17 minute ride. At the end
of the day, we decided to wend our way back to the apartment on foot
to see more of the neighborhoods - something we couldn&rsquo;t do if we
brought our own bikes.</p>
<h3 id="issues-and-annoyances">Issues and annoyances</h3>
<p>One problem we had, was lack of internet. Without internet, you can&rsquo;t
use the mobile app to find bike and docks. This turned out not to be
too much of a problem as Montreal seems to be saturated with Bixi
stations but it was a concern if we wanted to venture to more fringe
areas.</p>
<p>Another problem was that there seemed to be a number of broken
docks. They were full, but the kiosk was non-responsive. This led to a
dual problem &ndash; finding a place to dock your bike and taking another
bike out. This hit us twice, but fortunately, nearby docks were
working with bikes and docks.</p>
<p>A third problem, and this one I never would have thought about before,
is that the Montreal bikes have shorter seat posts than the NY
bikes. This is actually a big deal. I&rsquo;m about 5'10&rdquo; with short limbs
and at maximum height, the bikes were too short. My son&rsquo;s legs are
longer. Neither of us are giants. This made for a less comfortable and
slower ride. I guess people might not notice &ndash; even in NY I always
see people on rentals and Citibikes with their seats too low.</p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<p>I still love my Bike Friday.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m also liking this bike share touring thing as well.</p>
