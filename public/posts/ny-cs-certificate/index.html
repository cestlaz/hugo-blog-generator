Last April I woke up early and trekked up to Albany along with a few
of my Hunter College colleagues to share our thoughts on K12 Computer
Science teacher certification with the Board of Regents. We gave a
presentation to the Regents Higher Education Committee and afterwards
had a chance to talk with some of the Regents as well as other members
of the New York State Department of Education.
</p>
<p>
I left feeling that our proposals were well received and I think
everyone present - both the Hunter and NYSED contingents hoped that
things would move forward on this important issue.
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to today, December 8, 2017. I was up at the crack
of dawn. Driving in the dark in the snow from NYC to Albany to once
again attend a Board of Regents Higher Education Committee
meeting. This time, the agenda item was:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Proposed Amendments to Part 30 of the Regents Rules and Section 52.21
and Part 80 the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education Relating
to a New Certification Area and Tenure Area for Computer Science
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
No discussion or debate this time around just the proposal. If I
understand the process correctly, this should come up again at the
March meeting at which point it will be voted on. If approved, it
looks like we&#39;ll have a pathway towards certification for CS teachers.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t had a chance to dive into the details but at the meeting a
few key points came up:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
As the proposal indicates this will be a subject area in which a
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
teacher can be certified and be awarded tenure.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
There will be a traditional pathway for new teachers - Bachelors /
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Masters degree
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
There will be an alternative pathway for people entering from the
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
workforce
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
There will be an extension for teachers with another license so they
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
won&#39;t have to give up tenure in their current license.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
There will be an &#34;individual evaluation&#34; pathway which sounds to me
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
like it could catch people who fall through the cracks.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
There looks to be a sensible ramp up period - until September 2022
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There&#39;s a grandfathering provision that looks to last 10 years.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This sounds like a smart sensible plan. Multiple pathways, shallow
ramp up and provisions to protect existing teachers.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the devil is in the details. What&#39;s an approved program?
Can a grandfathered teacher teach all CS classes or just intro ones?
etc.
</p>
<p>
As I said, I haven&#39;t had a chance to dive into the details yet but
this is very exciting.
</p>
<p>
Prior to the meeting I was chatting with a few other people
attending. One, a <a href="http://www.uft.org/">UFT</a> representative was very excited about the
prospect. Another contingent, a group from <a href="https://www.nysut.org/">NYSUT</a> was very much against
a new certification area. Their position was that this would create a
teacher shortage because no one would have a CS license and no one
would get one due to the difference in salary between teaching and the
tech industry. I&#39;ve already written on how I feel that this is a <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/will-we-lose-cs-teachers-to-industry">red
herring</a>. What shocked me though was their feeling that &#34;we already
have many non-CS teachers effectively teaching CS across the
state. They&#39;re doing a great job and don&#39;t need any additional content
or pedagogical knowledge.&#34; I think they&#39;re wrong and I also think that
when we as a community talk about how our summer professional
development is all that&#39;s needed, we undercut CS education and
the teaching profession as a whole.
</p>
<p>
In any event this was a big step for New York. I tried to individually
thank as many of the participants as I could for helping shepherd this
along but could only speak to a few so I&#39;ll just give a blanket thank
you here to the NY State Board of Regents, Board of Education and
State Education department.
