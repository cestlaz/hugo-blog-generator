Over on the <a href="https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/">CS Educator StachExchange</a>, which is in private beta for a
few more days, I saw a post asking about how to introduce the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A*
search algorithm</a>.
</p>
<p>
I taught A* as part of the APCS class at Stuy so I thought I&#39;d talk
about what I did here.
</p>
<p>
Some time around mid year, we get to intermediate recursion. This is
about the time, give or take, when we talk about the nlogn sorts.
</p>
<p>
We also build a recursive maze solver. It&#39;s a nice algorithm and a
nice little program. It&#39;s around 15 lines of code to perform a
recursive depth first search:
</p>
<img src="/img/astar/dfs.gif" alt="/img/astar/dfs.gif" title="/img/astar/dfs.gif" align="center" height="200px"/>
<p>
The basic algorithm is:
</p>
<div class="src src-java">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
It&#39;s a nice lesson because in addition to all the recursion stuff, we
also get to talk about state space, state space search, backtracking,
efficiency concerns and much more. After we finish the maze solver, we also talk about
other problems that can be similarly examined using state-space search
like the knights tour and N-queens problems.
</p>
<p>
A month or so later, when we&#39;re learning about stacks and queues as
data structures, we revisit the maze solver. This time we solve the
problem in a more general way. We talk about using a data structure to
hold the set of nodes that we&#39;re aware of and that we want to visit
next.
</p>
<div class="src src-java">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
As we write the solution, we see that using a queue for this
data structure yields a breadth first search:
</p>
<img src="/img/astar/bfs.gif" alt="/img/astar/bfs.gif" title="/img/astar/bfs.gif" align="center" height="200px"/>
<p>
while using a stack yields depth first.
</p>
<p>
All of this leads to a discussion as to how deciding on which
locations to look at next can greatly influence the steps to the
exit. From here it&#39;s easy to see that you can use a heuristic to order
the nodes in our data structure so that we explore &#34;better&#34;
possibilities first. The data structure becomes a priority queue and
we finally get to both &#34;best first&#34; and A* search:
</p>
<img src="/img/astar/astar.gif" alt="/img/astar/astar.gif" title="/img/astar/astar.gif" align="center" height="200px"/>
<p>
It&#39;s a nice sequence of lessons, albeit lessons spread out over
months. The end result is that the students see both the need and
motivation for something like A* and they see that it&#39;s not hard to
implement. One basic routine where you can plug in one of three data
structures - stack, queue, or priority queue to get very different
results.
