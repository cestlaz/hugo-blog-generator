I spent this evening as a crit advisor for this semesters <a href="http://tech.cornell.edu/studio/curriculum/product-studio">Project
Studio</a>. The class is basically a finishing class for their Masters
students. The class forms teams that work with a &#34;company champion&#34;
that acts an advisor to build a product.
</p>
<p>
As a Crit Advisor, I, along with two other people from the tech
industry have a give and take with three groups and hopefully we can
provide useful feedback.
</p>
<p>
As a &#34;tech industry person&#34; I feel a bit like an outsider since I&#39;m
really the &#34;teacher guy,&#34; but I think I had some worthwhile things to
share with the groups.  Besides,
I&#39;d like to think I&#39;m sufficiently in touch with the tech industry
through &#34;the family&#34; to be a reasonably sound advisor.
</p>
<p>
As it turns out, two of the groups I worked with had an education bent
so at least in terms of product they were in my wheelhouse.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t want to talk specifically about the student products since I
didn&#39;t ask permission but I did want to share a few thoughts.
</p>
<p>
The products reminded me very much of the projects my Stuy kids
produced in their senior SoftDev class. This is not to belittle the
Cornell Tech people but rather noting how advanced the work of the
Stuy kids is. Beyond that, I liked the composition of the groups I
talked to - nice combinations of skill sets and backgrounds.
</p>
<p>
I love the idea of the mentoring company which had an interesting effect on
the groups. In all cases, the mentoring company helped provide the
teams with an idea framework but in one case, I think the company&#39;s point of
view actually limited the groups vision a bit. This came up in our
discussions and I&#39;m hoping that the students got something out of
that.
</p>
<p>
I also liked the crit review I was part of - bringing in outsiders to
show your work to and to get feedback from. It would probably hard
logistically at Stuy, but I&#39;ll talk to the guys there about the
concept.
</p>
<p>
I shared my contact info with the two groups that asked and if they
follow up, I&#39;d love to be a resource for them.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also looking forward to taking part in more events like this in
the future.
