<p>
We've been using <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a> in our intro course for years. It's a
wonderful programming environment. Many of you recall the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a>
programming language. NetLogo is like Logo but instead of programming
a turtle, you write a program that's run by multiple, perhaps hundreds
of turtles and also by the world the turtles live on.
</p>

<p>
Some of the reasons we like it are that it's:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An easy accessible textual programming language</li>
<li>Makes building a graphical interface trivial</li>
<li>great for modeling</li>
<li>Comes with tons of demo models</li>
</ul>

<p>
And now, with the latest version, NetLogo programs/models can be
deployed as web sites. All you have to do is save your program as
"NetLogo Web" and put it up on a observer somewhere.
</p>

<p>
If you haven't you should download and install NetLogo, run it, then
go to the file menu and look at the built in models.
</p>

<p>
I also enjoy playing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">Cellular Automata</a> and NetLogo's a wonderful
platform to play with. The turtles live on a grid of patches and just
like the turtles, the patches will all run your program over and over.
</p>

<p>
The patches make perfect cells for a cellular automaton and you can
implement a rule set in your patches.
</p>

<p>
NetLogo even comes with a bunch of built in demo models for Cellular
Automata including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>, probably the most famous CA.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Conway's Game of Life is somewhat cliche and while
I find it fascinating, it doesn't really solve a practical problem, at
least on on the surface.
</p>

<p>
So, I was looking for something more practical to do and something
where we could explore some deeper CS concepts.
</p>

<p>
Image manipulation.
</p>

<p>
In class, we make a Cellular Automaton where each cell or patch is a
pixel in an image. In NetLogo, you can do this with the
"import-pcolors" command. Lower down, I have a demo that just manually
colors patches - the web version of NetLogo doesn't yet support that
command.
</p>

<p>
Task 1 - what if we want to shift the image over? The kids come up
with a solution pretty quickly: "We can just have each patch ask its
neighbor for its color." Here's the code they try:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-netlogo">; ask each patch to set its color to the color of the
; patch at relative location -1,0
to shift-naive
ask patches [ set pcolor [pcolor] of patch-at -1 0]
end
</pre>
</div>

<p>
To see what happens, scroll down to the NetLogo model below, click on
setup and then hit the <b><b>shift-naive</b></b> button a few times.
</p>

<p>
It doesn't work.
</p>

<p>
What's going on?
</p>

<p>
It's a synchronization issue.
</p>

<p>
Suppose we have the following three cells in a row:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="/img/shift-image/image1.png" alt="image1.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
If cell 3 asks cell 2 it's color before cell 2 asks cell 1's color, we
get the desired result:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="/img/shift-image/image2.png" alt="image2.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
But if cell 2 asks cell 1 for it's color first then cell 3 will
actually get cell 1's color:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="/img/shift-image/image3.png" alt="image3.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So now we have the students thinking about synchronization and
parallel processing and they don't even know it.
</p>

<p>
The solution's pretty easy, break the problem up into two steps.
</p>

<p>
First, have every patch ask its neighbor for its color and then once
everyone knows their neighbor's color, then change:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-html">patches-own [next-color]

to shift-correct
; figure out my next color
ask patches [ set next-color [pcolor] of patch-at -1 0 ]
; then switch to it
ask patches [ set pcolor next-color]
end
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You can run that by clicking <b><b>setup</b></b> again and then <b><b>shift-correct</b></b> a
few times.
</p>

<p>
There's some of the beauty of NetLogo - we can get kids to think about
some deep concepts while playing with an easy to use, fun, interactive
environment with a real textual programming language.
</p>

<p>
Stay tuned for part 2 when I'll talk about creating a cellular
automaton that can solve a maze.
