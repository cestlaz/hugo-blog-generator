It&#39;s no secret that I&#39;m something of an old curmudgeon in the K12 CS
Education world and I&#39;ve been critical of a number of initiatives and
organizations over the years but I&#39;ve been pretty quiet on the CS4All
movement in NYC Department of Education. I&#39;ve had and any number of
concerns though.
</p>
<p>
This past week at the inaugural meeting of New York City&#39;s CSTA
chapter we got a taste of the <a href="http://blueprint.cs4all.nyc/">NYC CS4All Blueprint</a>. A highlight was
this video:
</p>
<p>
&lt;iframe src=&#34;<a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/224494221">https://player.vimeo.com/video/224494221</a>&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</p>
<p>
Along with the <a href="http://blueprint.cs4all.nyc/resources/3/%0A">supporting web page</a>.
</p>
<p>
TL;DR - in a elementary school CS class, the students kept tapping out
drumbeats on the desk because they had drumming class the period
prior. Now the drumming teacher is teaching rhythms that match
segments of HTML so the students can tap and chant the line as a
memory aid.
</p>
<p>
Sure, it&#39;s nice when teachers can work together to support each other
but at the end of the day this is a mnemonic aid to memorize
HTML. Nothing particularly innovative here. Mnemonics like this are
great until there are too many to keep track of or ones that are too
similar.
</p>
<p>
The part that saddened me was that this  was the video that was
chosen  as a highlight, an exemplar. It was OK but there was
nothing new or innovative. What was worse was that there was no
computer science.
</p>
<p>
The kids were memorizing HTML. As we watched the video, my neighbor
nudged me and asked &#34;why are they memorizing HTML?&#34; I would ask the
same question. Now, I do think that HTML or some other mechanism to
create content that can be shared with the world is important. Having
students get there work out in the word can be tremendously rewarding
and motivating. Also, although I&#39;m not sold on it, some say that HTML
is a good stepping stone to CS but still.
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s try an experiment.
</p>
<p>
Imagine that lesson but instead of HTML the kids were learning
Microsoft word so instead of a chant for <code>&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code> you have a
chant for putting a link into a word document or instead of a chant
for <code>&lt;b&gt;somethingbold&lt;/b&gt;</code> you have a chant like
<code>control-b-typestuff-then-control-b</code>. Same lesson, same technique,
still no CS. You could also say that this was just one video and maybe
most of the year is about real CS. Maybe, but then why highlight this
on the CS4All web site as a featured resource.
</p>
<p>
This was disappointing but not surprising.
</p>
<p>
Some will say that kids aren&#39;t ready for hardcore CS at that
age. That&#39;s fine. We can have that discussion but if CS is appropriate
for whatever grade was in the video then it should be real CS. We can
also have endless discussing about what that is but memorizing HTML is
not it.
</p>
<p>
I wondered if the video was representative so I looked at <a href="http://blueprint.cs4all.nyc/resources/5/">another</a>. It
turned out this was also a lesson on HTML and again the video could of
been about any number of subject areas. I will give this one credit
for highlighting that you can do &#34;unplugged&#34; activities but it wasn&#39;t
really a CS activity.
</p>
<p>
Then there was <a href="http://blueprint.cs4all.nyc/resources/15/">this one</a>. No video here but how we structure a CS
lesson. We have this outline:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Warm-up
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Mini lesson
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Independent work time
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Share session
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Or, as we used to say back in the stone age:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Do Now
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Instructional activity
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
practice
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
summary
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Nothing new and nothing CS here. I used that model when I taught math
but deviated from it more and more as I developed my CS teaching
chops.
</p>
<p>
Finally I looked at <a href="http://blueprint.cs4all.nyc/resources/24/%0A">this one</a>. For full disclosure I have to say that
Eric, the teacher, is a friend of mine and I <strong><strong>know</strong></strong> he&#39;s a dynamite
teacher and I know he knows his stuff.
</p>
<p>
This video, however was all about differentiation. Just like the other
resources, there&#39;s nothing wrong with them per se but there&#39;s not
really about CS. You could reskin them for any subject.
</p>
<p>
I also agree with a lot of what Eric says in the video but as CS
Standards take hold and standardized exams become the norm we&#39;ll find
that individualized instruction and meeting students where they are
is in direct conflict with the testing that comes with standards. I&#39;ll
talk more about that in my standards rant that I keep putting off
writing.
</p>
<p>
Sure, the resources site has  a page with concepts like algorithms and
many schools, for better or worse, in the upper grades just fall back
on AP offerings but the more I dig the more it&#39;s apparent to me that
CS4All in NY will be more about getting something into every classroom
rather than something appropriate and good.
