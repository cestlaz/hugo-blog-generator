            <p>A little over a year ago, I decided it was time to reach out to my
alums, a group I refer to as the &ldquo;Stuy CS family&rdquo; and try to get us
together. The most rewarding part of my job involves the relationships
I&rsquo;ve developed over the years but is was always between me and my
alums and them to their classmates. This was an attempt to start
building a network that spanned the years.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we had our fourth meetup. Somewhere between fifty and
seventy tech professionals getting together over pizza and drinks. Our
past meetups were always at bars - it was easy - send out an email
with an address, time., and date, and people show up. This time, we
really wanted to include the younger crowd, the 18-20 year olds so a
bar was out. I asked the family if anyone could host and Ethan came
through, volunteering <a href="http://pave.com">Pave</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://pave.com">Pave</a> is a pretty neat company. The best way I can
describe them is that they invest in people. It&rsquo;s a place where
backers invest in prospects, not only financially, but socially as
well. I really like the idea and you should all check them out.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Pave folks were really awesome, offering space, helping to
oraganize and also taking part in the event.</p>
<p>The event was great and having it at a company rather than a bar or
restaurant had some unexpected side effects. Since there weren&rsquo;t
nearly as many chairs, people mixed more and as I said, this allowed
the younger set to meet the older alums.</p>

<p>Being at Pave made me think that as a teacher, my entire career is
about investing in people. Not in the same way as Pave, but still. My
results aren&rsquo;t financial but in community. Although Pave does have a
financial component to it, I really think they &ldquo;get it&rdquo; and wouldn&rsquo;t
be surprised if they end up getting the community rewards as well.</p>
