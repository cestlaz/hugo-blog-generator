<p>
I thought I'd add mine, at least a couple of thoughts.
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of issues - long term retention, transfer of knowledge
from the basics to more advanced tools, pattern recognition, and more.
</p>

<p>
It reminded me of Benjamin Zander's talk "Playing on one Buttock":

<p>
Check out the first five minutes.
</p>

<p>
Code reading is important, pair programming, where students are
constantly explaining to each other helps, and there are other
techniques.
</p>

<p>
We can also model thinking like a computer from day one.
</p>

<p>
Many of us start day one with exercises where students are the
computer. Perhaps using a simplified made up language or maybe by just
throwing some task at the kids and having them write instruction lists
for each other. That's a great start, but we can continue drawing the
relationship between the way we think and the way a computer works.
</p>

<p>
Take a simple intro problem &#x2013; finding the largest value in a list of
numbers.
</p>

<p>
The ultimate solution in Java might be:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">public</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">int</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">findMax</span>(<span style="color: #7CB8BB;">int</span>[] <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">L</span>){
maxIndex = 0;
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">for</span> (<span style="color: #7CB8BB;">int</span> <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">i</span>=0;i&lt;L.<span style="color: #7CB8BB;">length</span>;i++){
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">if</span> (a[i]&lt;a[maxIndex]){
maxIndex = i;
}
}
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">return</span> maxIndex;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Somewhere along the development process, I ask my students how they
would find the largest value in list. If the list was short, they
might just scan it. If the list was very long, they do the same thing
as our Java snippet does - remember the largest so far as we scan down
the list one by one. At first, we just think we're scanning the list,
but if we slow things down, we see that we're following pretty much
the same algorithm as what we'd write in code.
</p>

<p>
I use this technique throughout all my classes - slow ourselves down
and really analyze the steps towards solving the problem. No single
technique is going to teach our kids how to think about and comprehend
code, but it's another tool in our bag of tricks.
</p>

This is my first post written using <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/">Emacs</a> <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a>. I've been using it
for years but only now discovering how amazing a tool it is.
