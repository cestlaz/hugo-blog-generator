Last post was a little heavy so just a short fun one for today.
</p>

<p>
"Just another day at StuyCS." That was the subject of the email Brian
sent with the photo above. What's going on?
</p>

<p>
We're working on advanced JavaScript while also looking at
<i>Backbone.js</i>.
</p>

<p>
Now, as sometimes happens, Batya, while in her CS class up at college,
decided to open up a Google chat with me. This happens now and then. We try to
have some fun with it. We actually have a plan to mess with the kids
later this term, but I'll keep that to myself.
</p>

<p>
Now, Batya, of course, was sitting in her CS class in college. I told
her what we were doing and continued with the lesson.  She responded
that Zach, her boyfriend and my former student said not to forget to
emphasize certain things. I also asked Batya if her professor was
having a chat with his kid while he was teaching. Everyone was having a
laugh.
</p>

<p>
Then things got sillier. Another chat popped up. It was Natan, my son,
who happens to be in that class. So, the insanity continued on when I
get a video call -  it was from Aida sitting in row 1 - that's what you
see on the screen.
</p>

<p>
Now it was getting a little ridiculous and it all started with Batya
and Natan. So, what's a a teacher to do? I had to contact their
parent, my wife, to tell her to discipline her children. That's the
third chat.
</p>

<p>
So, just another day at StuyCS.
