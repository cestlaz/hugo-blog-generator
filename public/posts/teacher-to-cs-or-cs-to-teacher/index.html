Is it easier to take CS people and teach them to teach or is it easier

The question gets batted around from time to time.

The conversation was referring to blog posts by <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/06/become-computer-science-teacher-in-five.html?spref=tw&amp;m=1">Alfred Thompson</a> and <a href="https://gflint.wordpress.com/2017/06/20/a-week-of-in-service-another-python-course/">Garth flint</a>.
Alfred&#39;s key point - one that I&#39;ve spoken about before is that short
term professional development does not a CS teacher make.
</p>
<p>
As to the lead in question? I&#39;ve seen both routes succeed and both
routes fail. Both can be heavy lifts but there&#39;s a missing part of the
equation that&#39;s never addressed.
</p>
<p>
The claim is that it&#39;s easier to teach CS to a non-CS teacher because
they already know how to teach. The problem is, particularly in the
later grades that teachers of different subject areas have very
different tool sets. Sure, there are common factors – get the kids
involved, layer, spiral, etc. but you don&#39;t teach a CS lesson the same
way you teach a math lesson let alone a literature, history, language
lesson.
</p>
<p>
In a math class, it&#39;s common to have students write solutions to
problems up on the board. If you try that in a CS class, you&#39;ll be
waiting 20 minutes while the kids transcribe the problems. Likewise,
math homework will likely consist of a certain amount of repetitive
practice problems whereas a CS class won&#39;t have something directly
analogous. This is not to say that you don&#39;t have opportunities for
students to present at the board in CS class or that there isn&#39;t
worthwhile homework but rather that even at this simple level, there
are differences.
</p>
<p>
So, if we&#39;re going to teach a non-CS teacher the CS content, beyond
the challenge of giving them the necessary depth and breadth of
content knowledge we have to teach them how to teach CS.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve inventoried some of the techniques my colleagues and I have used
in our classes and the collected methods could easily fill a couple of
graduate education courses.
</p>
<p>
So, what&#39;s the answer to the question? It doesn&#39;t matter where you
start but if we want to do right by our kids we need to prepare them
in not two but three areas:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
CS Content
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
CS Pedagogy
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
General education and pedagogy
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Short term PD (professional development) won&#39;t do it and neither will
scripts for &#34;teachers&#34; to follow. It&#39;s going to take time, will, and
effort.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s hoping that municipalities look at the long game. It&#39;s fine to
do PD now to get something started but it&#39;s not enough. I wanted my
kids math teachers to know math and how to teach it. We should demand
no less from our CS teachers.
