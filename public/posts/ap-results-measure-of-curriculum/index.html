This past weekend was <a href="http://catskillsconf.com">Catskillsconf</a> - my favorite event of the
year. I spent the weekend up in Ulster County with a bunch of my
students. some great friends old and new, and Devorah. It was a great
weekend but I was mostly offline.
</p>
<p>
As a result I missed a rather heated discussion in the CS Ed Facebook
groups. The debate was over whether or not Strong AP CSP exam results
are indicative of a good curriculum or good professional development (PD).
</p>
<h2 id="headline-1">
TL;DR - NO!!!!!
</h2>
<p>
Further, anyone who thinks that a set of exam results can tell you
that a particular PD sequence or curriculum is good shouldn&#39;t be
allowed to call themselves a teacher and I don&#39;t want them anywhere
near my kids.
</p>
<p>
I guess that language is strong, even for me but it&#39;s true.
</p>
<p>
Tests are designed to assess students and many tests don&#39;t even do
that well. They shouldn&#39;t be used to measure something further
removed.
</p>
<p>
The last time this idea made its rounds was using student test results
for teacher evaluation. They do that in NY. A judge called the
practice &#34;capricious&#34; and &#34;arbitrary.&#34; My friend and former
colleague Gary Rubinstein showed a year or so ago that standardized
test scores varied enough from year to year so as to make the ratings
useless [fn::sorry, I just got back from the weekend trip and am too tired
to find the link. You can go to his site and search and while you&#39;re
there, there&#39;s lots of good stuff to read.]
</p>
<p>
Using test scores to say a PD sequence is good? What if that PD
focused on test prep? What if it did nothing in particular? When I was
at Stuy and when I was at Seward Park the Calc teachers&#39; students had
great AP results. I can tell you that none of those teachers had any
quality PD specific to AP Calc.
</p>
<p>
Curriculum? My mentor and friend Danny Jaye told me many times - &#34;A
great teacher can save a class from a  horrible curriculum but a great
curriculum will do nothing for a class with a horrible teacher.&#34; He
was right. Again, what if the curriculum encourages test prep. What if
pressure on the teacher encourages them to focus on test prep
regardless of curriculum or PD (see my recent <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/standards-who-for">post</a>).
</p>
<p>
An AP test measures one thing - how well the student did on the AP
test. There are so many variables that go into a class:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Is it first period at 8:00am?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Is it the last class of the day?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Is it before lunch or right afterwards?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
What about right after Gym.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
What&#39;s the mix of students - every class is different
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Is the teacher teaching the subject once a day? Two times? Five
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
times?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
How large is the class
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
How many other classes are the kids taking?
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The list goes on and on. There are so many contributing factors that
you just can&#39;t say &#34;Good test results = good curriculum&#34; or &#34;good test
results = good PD.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Want to know if a curriculum is good - have experienced teachers who
know their subject run it a few times through and ask them. Same for
PD.
</p>
<p>
Teachers know education a lot better than test makers, curriculum
developers and PD providers. How about listening to them for a change?
