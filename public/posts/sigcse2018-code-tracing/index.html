Next up from SIGCSE is <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3159527">An Explicit Strategy to Scaffold Novice Program
Tracing</a> by Benjamin Xie, Greg Nelson and Andy Ko, presented by
Benjamin Xie.
</p>
<p>
The core of Xie&#39;s presentation was that tracing through code is a good
thing and that spending a short amount of time teaching code
tracing can lead to improved student outcomes.
</p>
<p>
The idea is simple. Walk through the code as though you were the
computer running your program. Xie suggested that students frequently
struggle with code tracing. They have a hard time keeping track of
variables, they try to work entirely in their head and being novices,
they don&#39;t have any good way of representing overall program
state. Personally, I also think there&#39;s a resistance these days to
doing thing by hand. Xie noted that students can trace through their
programs using online tools such as debuggers with steppers but doing
so is a passive process. The student just clicks next over and over
again. They aren&#39;t actively engaged in the code tracing.
</p>
<p>
That last point is a very important one. That passive clicking through
a stepper seems similar to me to students ignoring compiler warnings
or students using robust auto completion or snippets which I believe
retards their learning of fundamental constructs.
</p>
<p>
Xie shared a simple directed strategy to enable students to &#34;embody
the computer:&#34;
</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Read question: Understand what you are being asked to do. At the end of the problem instructions, write a check mark.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Find where the program begins executing. At the start of that line, draw an arrow.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Execute each line according to the rules of Java.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
From the syntax, determine the rule for each part of the line.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Follow the rules.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Update memory table(s).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Find the code for the next part.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Repeat until the program terminates.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
When tracing through the code, a participant creates a memory
table with each method call…
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In additionn to the strategy, Xie produced a simple paper handout on
which students could write down variable values and easily organize
and store the computers state as they traced through a program.
</p>
<p>
Xie noted that just a few minutes of instruction to give the kids a
concrete method of code tracing can provide big postitive returns.
</p>
<p>
The presentation was terrific and all true and I&#39;m sure of tremendous
value to anyone in the audience not familiar with code tracing but it
was also the presentation that led me to compose this tweet:
</p>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Loving the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sigcse2018?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#sigcse2018</a> sessions but so many talks from higher Ed people remind me that while k12 can learn much about content from higher Ed, profs could learn so much from teachers about teaching</p>&mdash; Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) <a href="https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/967066702143000578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>
While Xie&#39;s presentation was terrific, code tracing and teachers
showing explicit code tracing strategies to kids is nothing new. I
remember being taught about this back in the 80s. We called it a &#34;desk
check&#34; back then. While it&#39;s true that maybe this was explicitly
taught because we were using punch cards and our programs were run
overnight, it was also taught to me by math teachers with very
limited CS knowledge. It&#39;s also a practice that appears to be pretty
common among High School CS teachers even when their content
knowledge is spotty. We also frequently employ things like state
diagrams, cons cell diagrams, and other techniques to capture state
and assist in program tracing.
</p>
<p>
This seemed to me to be a great example of something that in my
experience is a not uncommon technique for high school CS teachers but
maybe isn&#39;t used as widely at the college level (?).
</p>
<p>
The other thing this made me think about was the divide between
practitioners and researchers. I think everyone knows which camp I&#39;m
in. Andy Ko, Benji Xie&#39;s advisor and co-author mentioned this in his
<a href="https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/sigcse-2018-trip-report-cs-for-all-57f1cf94155f">SIGCSE summary</a>. When I read the actual paper, it notes that they
basically worked with 24 students and looked at the results. So,
that&#39;s research. On the other hand, when I share a takeaway from
looking at my 150 kids a year whom I met five days a week and look at
this over decades, it&#39;s just an anecdote. Hmmmm.
</p>
<p>
One other side point is that in Andy&#39;s summary he notes his perception
that SIGCSE is largely a teacher&#39;s conference as opposed to other
conferences he goes to which he says are more researcher&#39;s
conferences. I&#39;ve only been to two SIGCSE&#39;s but my teacher friends tell
me that they feel that SIGCSE is more of a researcher&#39;s conference and
CSTA is more of a teacher&#39;s conference. I guess it&#39;s all a matter of
perspective and frame of reference. Also possibly because I think of
teacher as K12 teachers as teachers and professors as profressors be
they research or teaching faculty.
</p>
<p>
Finally ,given all of this, was the talk and paper of value?
Tremendously so. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a new technique and I think it&#39;s
fairly well disseminated in the K12 space but that said, it&#39;s a good
technique and it will be new to some. It&#39;s also hard to get students
these days to meticulously do anything on paper and sharing a
successful practice is always of great value. Finally, it left me
thinking about extending online environments such as <a href="http://thonny.org/">Thonny</a> to support
restricted code tracing where the students would have to enter the
state of all changed variables in a given line before the stepper
would move to the next one.
</p>
<p>
I very much enjoyed this SIGCSE session. You can read the paper linked
at the top if you have access to the ACM Digital Library. If not, you
can read Benji Xi&#39;s medium post <a href="https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/teaching-a-strategy-for-reading-code-fbc9f4044cab">here</a>.
