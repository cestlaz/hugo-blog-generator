<p>
Just had an interesting conversation with <a href="http://chrisgrant.co/">Chris</a>, one of our <a href="http://cstuy.org/">CSTUY</a>
mentors. Chris is working with one of our more advanced groups of
hackers - they'll be creating a web based app that with ultimately be
deployed as mobile using <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>.
</p>

<p>
The question he had was "<a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a> or <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a>."
</p>

<p>
Chris and I have had this conversation before. I was explaining at the
time why I preferred to use Backbone.js over Angular in my SoftDev
classes. Part of the reason is that the current version of Angular is
already deprecated while the new version isn't ready for prime time
yet. This means I'd be teaching to a dead end. More importantly, Angular
is a much higher level framework than Backbone. There's a lot of
"magic" going on. Just a few short lines of code and you're done.
</p>

<p>
Backbone is much closer to the metal. It does less work for you so it
let's me drill down with the kids all the way to the source. This way
the kids understand what's going on under the hood. As my buddy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerryseidman">Gerry</a>
says, "never use a tool you couldn't write yourself." I personally
like low level tools like Backbone.js. If you have to get a job
done quickly, it might not be the right tool, but for teaching,
it's terrific.
</p>

<p>
I think Chris was surprised when I said that a higher level tool like
Angular could very well be appropriate for our Saturday Hackers and
that I'd certainly support whichever direction Chris wanted to go in
with his team.
</p>

<p>
Why  might it be right in this case?
</p>

<p>
Mostly because the hackers only meet once a week. In our Saturday
sessions, we want our kids to learn, but we also need to create an
environment where they can continue to progress on their
projects. Some times, compromise is needed. Angular will let them get
up and running within the constraints of our program and the hackers
will still learn a lot, particularly with people like Chris mentoring them.
</p>

<p>
That's the balance we strive to achieve - a good amount of real CS but
tempered with the realities of a once a week program.
</p>

<p>
We could go the way of many other CS programs out there and
just use tools that do 90% of the work but we like to think we have a
higher standard and I think that's what makes our team of teachers and
mentors special.
