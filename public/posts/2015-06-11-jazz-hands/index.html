<a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2015/03/08/antother-day-stuycs.html#.VXmHfN_08bw">silliness</a> - one of the reasons StuyCS is a family is that we try to
have fun.
</p>

<p>
Jazz Hands day was the latest.
</p>

<p>
I got the idea at JonAlf's wedding. The wait staff were all wearing
white gloves - all of a sudden it hit me - Jazz Hands!!!! and Jazz
Hands day was born.
</p>

<p>
The idea:
</p>

<p>
All of our Junior and Senior CS students, around 350 or so, along with
their teachers would wear white gloves on a specified day. The rules
were throughout the day, in any class, provided there were two or more
CS Jazz Hands students in the class, whenever:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a student gave a good thoughtful answer to a question
</li>
<li>or the teacher made a particularly strong point
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The kids would give a Jazz Hands salute.
</p>

<p>
Imagine, some kid gives a great answer and 1/3 of the class all of a
sudden does Jazz Hands!!!!
</p>

</p>
</div>


<p>
Unfortunately, this was an event that I wouldn't actually be able to
see as the havoc would be wreaked in other classes.
</p>

<p>
By the time we got to the end of the day, I knew we were on to
something.
</p>

<p>
Word on the street was that a bunch of teachers thought it was
hilarious. Apparently one teacher pulled the math chair into her class
so she could see.
</p>

<p>
Then we had at least a few teachers that didn't get into the spirit
and actually lodged complaints.
</p>

<p>
Let's see, we had students, via a non-verbal form of feedback,
indicate that they were totally engaged by acknowledging what they
felt was a good point.
</p>

<p>
Disruptive?
</p>

<p>
Imagine that.
</p>

<p>
I don't know what makes me want to fine tune this event more - the
positive feedback or the complaints.
