The assignment: Find some interesting data out and do something with it. Make a web page that shows what you did and what you discoverde. We had already looked at the NYC Data Mine as well as a few other sources but students were encouraged to find new data sourcess." />

            <p>About a month ago, I talked about using <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2013/04/14/Real_Data.html#.UZjTjqDctKk">real
data</a>
with our intro classes. After looking at the correlation between
school&rsquo;s SAT scores and free and reduced lunch rates, it was time to
turn the students loose.</p>
<p>The assignment: Find some interesting data out and do something with
it. Make a web page that shows what you did and what you
discoverde. We had already looked at the NYC Data Mine as well as a
few other sources but students were encouraged to find new data sourcess.</p>
<p>The results were terrific. On top of the requirements, some students
figured out how to incorporate Google Maps, graphs, and other niceties
well beyond what we&rsquo;ve covered in class.</p>
