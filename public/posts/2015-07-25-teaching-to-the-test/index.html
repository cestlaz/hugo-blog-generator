This image has been making its rounds.

<p>
Largest expansion is pretty clear but are the largest gain in 3+
scores mean a higher percentage of 3+ scores or merely the result of
more test takers?
</p>

<p>
I'm curious, but that's not what I wanted to talk about.
</p>

<p>
Looking at our AP results from this year we had:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/teaching-to-the-test/2015.png" alt="2015.png" width="250px" align="center" />

<p>
For the past two years we've been allowed to run 7 sections of AP
Computer Science with about 30 kids per class. Prior to that we were
limited to five sections. There hasn't been a change in either percent
passing and more importantly the percentage of 4 and 5 scores for
years. I suspect that if we were allowed to open more sections to meet
demands the overall percentage of 4/5 scores would remain the same.
</p>

<p>
While we always are mostly 4s and 5s, the interesting point this year
is that we had a much higher percentage of 5s to 4s.
</p>

<p>
Two possibilities I can think of. One is that the depending on how the test is scored
and the fact that there were so many additional test takers it changed the
curve. Since I've never been involved in the scoring, I can't comment
on this.
</p>

<p>
The other change is that the College Board dropped the case study - a
large sample project that students are supposed to study throughout
the class. Between 20% and 30% of the AP Exam was based on the case
study.
</p>

<p>
I'm guessing that some teachers liked the case study but it never
worked for me. What's more, all of us at Stuy pretty much agree on the
subject. It's like those CS texts that have one long continuous
project throughout &#x2013; if the project, its design and implementation
make sense to you and how you teach, you can just work through the
text. If not, the text becomes next to useless.
</p>

<p>
We all hated the case study and so we all paid it minimal lip
service. Teaching the case study would amount to teaching to the
test. We'd rather teach Computer Science <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
I'm pretty certain that some of our kids were slowed down on the AP
exam due to our approach to the case study but they still did fine and
besides, for our kids, the exam generally doesn't mean a thing. In our
experience if a student goes to the CS department at their college and
shows their stuff, they'll be placed appropriately. It didn't matter
if they got a 5, a 4, a 3, or even if they didnt take the exam at all.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps that's the reason for our uptick in 5s vs 4s. No case study
and all of a sudden our kids weren't at a disadvantage.
</p>

<p>
I can't say for certain but it seems plausible.
</p>

<p>
If we taught to the test, I'm guessing more students would have scored
5s all along.
</p>

<p>
The concern?
</p>

<p>
If the College Board continues to be the driving force, either solo or
in partnership with organizations like code.org, the importance of the
AP Exam will remain. It's already considered by many the gold
standard - if your kids take and do well on AP exams, your school must
be a top school.
</p>

<p>
Educators know better. AP Exams are not the be all and end all and in
fact, many of us would like to be rid of them altogether so that we
could just teach rigorous courses and not to the test.
</p>

<p>
The end game is predictable. Just as we will see more and more
teaching to the test in common core and regents classes so we will see
in computer science.
</p>

<p>
I predict that there will be a few pockets of excellence here and
there but in the end, canned AP prep will win the day. We'll have CS
in the schools but not so much good CS.
