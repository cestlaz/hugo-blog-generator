I read <a href="http://nancyebailey.com/2017/09/05/xq-super-schools-business-working-to-end-public-high-schools/">this</a> piece earlier today on <a href="https://twitter.com/NancyEBailey1">Nancy Bailey</a>&#39;s blog.
</p>
<p>
TL;DR (although it really isn&#39;t too long so you should read it) - it&#39;s
on Laurene Powell Jobs, her efforts to &#34;reform&#34; education and why
she&#39;s misguided as are most of the well to do non-educators working
hard to change and in many cases privatize public education.
</p>
<p>
Laura posts a nice list of simple, common sense ways to improve
education. I&#39;ll repost them here:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
For years, research has shown that high school students need more sleep. They should have later start times. .
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Smaller class sizes would help.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Make sure teachers don’t have so many preparation plans.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
End advanced placement classes (IMHO).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improve career-technical classes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Provide rich extra-curricular activities.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Bring back life skill classes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Include a social justice curriculum.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Include students on the disciplinary board.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Provide civics education.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Make sure students get opportunities to participate in the arts.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Work to include the community.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Ensure students have access to counselors, and school support staff.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Every high school should have a great library, a real librarian, and technology and books.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Looks very much like what those elite private schools that those rich
non-educators send their kids to.
</p>
<p>
The other day I also overheard a conversation between two
professors. One noted that they had just taught a course totally
online for the first time and that the professor really had fun doing
it.
</p>
<p>
These got me thinking more about all the secret sauce and magic
bullets coming from tech to save education - things like MOOCS or  &#34;personalized&#34;
learning system.
</p>
<p>
I started to wonder - have these <strong><strong>ever</strong></strong> been pushed on public
schools because they&#39;re better or rather because they cut costs (or in
the slightly better case to reach a student that otherwise wouldn&#39;t
have any opportunity which, in a way is generally cost related).
</p>
<p>
I couldn&#39;t come up with a single instance. They&#39;re always a way to
replace what I consider personalized instruction – you know, when a
teacher has a small class and can personally deal with, learn about,
interact with, and teach the child. Kids spend hours in front of a
screen instead of working with others. Kids do a MOOC (or maybe drop
out of a MOOC) so that you can have your student/teacher ratio reach
ridiculous levels. I&#39;ve never seen any tech solution rolled out to
public schools because it&#39;s better. Only to cut costs.
</p>
<p>
How do I know that it&#39;s not better? Well, we have Nancy&#39;s list
above. It&#39;s what those rich people pay all that money to the elite
private schools for.  If all these solutions the Jobs and Gates of the
world were so much better, wouldn&#39;t they insist upon them  for their
own children?
</p>
<p>
Just some Friday food for thought.
