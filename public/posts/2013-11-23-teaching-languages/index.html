            <p>Java&rsquo;s never been my favorite language either for using or for
teaching.</p>
<p>As a programmer, after starting with languages like Fortran
and Pascal, I really cut my teeth with C. More recently, Python has
been my go to language to get real work done.</p>
<p>From a teaching point of view most languages have good points
and bad ones. When the AP class went from Pascal to C++ I lamented
losing the simplicity and the low cost of entry. On the other hand,
C++ gave us objects (not that I&rsquo;m a big OOP guy), separate files, the
ability to use tons of real world libraries and more.</p>
<p>Moving to Java simplified things in a number of ways but removed
memory management. If we didn&rsquo;t teach that along with the stack frame
in our Systems class, I think our kids would be missing something very
important.</p>
<p>I was reminded of some of Java&rsquo;s limitations as a teaching language over the past couple of days.</p>
<p>As posted earlier, I had my AP students create their own class to
mimic the Java ArrayList. Before introducing the ArrayList in Java, I
wanted to introduce generics:</p>
<p>public class myList<!-- raw HTML omitted --> {
T[] data;
public myList() {
data = new T[10];
}
// much more not shown
}</p>
<p>Turns out, you can no longer do this.</p>
<p>After doing some searching, there does appear to be a way to get this
effect but it was certainly not something I wanted to do with my
classes. I was looking for something more pedagogically sound - an
easy way to show the concept and a way to springboard to an ArrayList.</p>
<p>Oh well&hellip;</p>
<p>So, we finished ArrayLists and I was mapping out a plan for Monday. I
thought Radix sort would be cool &ndash; we already introduced using an
array to tally votes when we did the mode. This seemed to be a natural
extension. It would combine Arrays and ArrayLists and illustrate when each is appropriate.</p>
<p>First the kids would set up an array of 10 buckets, each being an ArrayList:</p>
<p>public class Buckets {
ArrayList<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[] buckets;
public Buckets() {
buckets = new ArrayList<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[10];
for (int i=0;i&lt;10;i++)
buckets[i] = new ArrayList<!-- raw HTML omitted -->();
}
// much more not shown
}</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Java type safety once again reared its ugly head. OK,
maybe not ugly to a programmer, but ugly to a teacher. You can&rsquo;t do
it. You can do it with an old school ArrayList without the generic:
<code>ArrayList[] buckets = new Arraylist[10];</code> but of course, this
leaves you open to type mismatch problems.</p>
<p>Once again, Java provides a convoluted workaround that might be fine
for a professional programmer, but for a student, it would be nuts.</p>
<p>I might go ahead with the Radix sort lesson anyway, we&rsquo;ll see, but it
would be nice if I could teach this level of course without having to
fight the implementation language.</p>
