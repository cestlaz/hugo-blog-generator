I got  an email from a friend the other day. Among other things, he
mentioned that he would be teaching APCS-A for the first time this
year. He&#39;s a little trepidatious. He knows his stuff but he hasn&#39;t
really done much using Java.

I was going to respond in an email but thought I might share here

<p>
The first time I taught APCS was some time around 1991 or 1992. It was at
<a href="http://www.sewardparkhs.com/Famous-Alumni/">Seward Park</a> <a href="http://www.sewardparkhs.com/History/">High School</a>. It was the AB curriculum - that is one
semester of programming in Pascal and one semester of Data Structures
and Algorithms.  Being a computer science major the core material was
never a concern. I had taken APCS the first time it was offered in May
1984 in Pascal and while most of my college and pre-teaching professional work
was in C, my college started it&#39;s CS sequence with Pascal. I was more
concerned with the actual teaching part. I had taught math for a year
and a half at that point but never CS and by any measure I was still
wet behind the ears. I never finished that first experience because I
was excessed to Stuy mid semester. I wasn&#39;t particularly happy with my
performance but looking back, I think I did a pretty good job given
the situation and my experience.
</p>
<p>
After teaching math for a year and a half I was back in APCS at
Stuy. Still in Pascal. I spent the next few years figuring out how to
teach CS and APCS in particular along with starting a couple of new
classes. When the College Board decided to move the AP class to C++ I
was happy, sad and a little worried. Pascal had a bunch of limitations
but I had never used C++. True, I was a C programmer at heart but I
had never really done the OOP thing. I did, as it turned out, design a
number of my C systems in an Object Typed design: I would use a single
file per &#34;class&#34; where local variables were de facto instance
variables and functions in the file were methods and each file was a
singleton class. I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Analysis-Design-Applications-3rd/dp/020189551X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503519770&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Grady+Booch">Booch</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Software-Construction-Book-CD-ROM/dp/0136291554/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8">Meyer</a> on my own but I had no
schooling in OOP and no professional experience.
</p>
<p>
As it turned out, I didn&#39;t have to worry. I knew my CS and while it
took me a while to become comfortable with OOP, the class, and of
course I knew this from the get go, started from nothing and built
up complexity a step at a time. The worst that might have happened is
that some of my solutions might have been more C-esque than C++.
</p>
<p>
The move to Java was a little more jarring. Now we had a totally new
language. I couldn&#39;t fall back on C. It removed memory management and
explicit pointers and it had to be used in an Object Oriented
manner. I remember asking Mike Schidlowsky, a former student turned
friend who was the Java consultant on the Java edition of Sedgewick&#39;s
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Robert-Sedgewick-Algorithms-Fundamentals-Structures/dp/B008VR3ZH4/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503520269&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=schidlowsky">Algorithms</a> book how to do something. It had to do with passing and
modifying arrays. In C there were a number of ways to accomplish what
I wanted to do. In Java, I couldn&#39;t figure out how to do it the way I
wanted. My friend Mike told me &#34;you just don&#39;t do it that way in
Java.&#34; Again, it turned out that I didn&#39;t have to worry. The basic
coding was still the same as were the data structures and
algorithms. The only challenge was that I had to get into a Java OOP
mindset which it turned out wasn&#39;t that hard.
</p>
<p>
While I never really warmed up to OOP - I find other paradigms more
natural for me, I knew my CS and got more and more comfortable with
the Java (or C++) way of doing things as time wore on. Sometimes I
would say &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34; or &#34;let&#39;s figure it out&#34; but that&#39;s OK.
</p>
<p>
Nowadays, there are many more resources available for CS teachers. If
you&#39;re new, lean on them. Use the mailing lists, stackexchange,
facebook groups. Online resources like repl.it, codehs.com etc. Yes,
it&#39;s true that you&#39;ll be better next time around and even better years
down the road but right now, you&#39;re probably better than you think.
</p>
<p>
A number of my former students volunteer for <a href="https://www.tealsk12.org/">TEALS</a> - a really great
program that brings software engineers into the classroom to work with
non-CS teachers to deliver instruction. A number of my kids have
shared the following sentiment:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m really helping
the teacher to become self sufficient or if I&#39;m a great teacher but I
do know one thing - while I&#39;m there, the kids are getting a hell of a
lot more than if I wasn&#39;t there.&#34;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
â€“ Remember that as well.
