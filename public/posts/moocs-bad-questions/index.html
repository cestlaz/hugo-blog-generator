Most mornings, I start my day with a workout. Sometimes I run,
sometimes I use my bike trainer. Dealing with plantar
fasciitis since last June, it&#39;s mostly been the bike.
</p>
<p>
I occupy the time by either watching YouTube videos or catching up on
<a href="https://cacm.acm.org/">Communications of the ACM</a> or <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/">American Scientist</a>. I&#39;m about 6 months
behind on both.
</p>
<p>
Inspired by some talk in one of the CS Ed Facebook groups, I thought
I&#39;d use the time to start going through some MOOCs. I started with
Udacity&#39;s Intro to Information Security.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m only in lesson 4 but it&#39;s pretty light weight and generally well
presented but I keep seeing the same thing that pisses me off about
moocs. At the end of the day the video is just a lecture and what&#39;s
worse, a lecture with no feedback loop.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love the fact that Udacity and the others have
their material up online and that I can get to it free of charge but I
don&#39;t love the fact there are people that still believe putting a computer
in front of a kid is better than a teacher.
</p>
<p>
I think this quiz question is pretty representative of what I&#39;m
talking about.
</p>
<img src="/img/mooc-question.png" alt="/img/mooc-question.png" title="/img/mooc-question.png" align="center" height="400"/>
<p>
It&#39;s just a silly inline quiz question and not a particularly
important one but it pisses me off.
</p>
<p>
To start with, it uses the word  <strong><strong>could</strong></strong>  not <strong><strong>did</strong></strong>. That means
that every answer is correct. In fact an asnwer  choice like
&#34;we&#39;re more secure because we have this really good engineer named
Stanley&#34; could be given and would be a correct answer since  the
vendor <strong><strong>could</strong></strong> base their claim on Stanley&#39;s awesomness, it would
just be a bad idea. Unless you remember the specific ad campaign, you won&#39;t
know the answer  and even if you did, internally, they could use any
justification they want.
</p>
<p>
It reminds me of when my brother was in grade school and he had a test
question of:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Can you name all 50 states in the United States of America?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
My brother&#39;s answer was &#34;no.&#34; He was correct. I don&#39;t remember if the
teacher agreed.
</p>
<p>
To be fair, I&#39;m just watching the videos and it&#39;s possible that the
readings clarified the question but even so, this is a very bad
question.
</p>
<p>
Yes, it&#39;s just a silly quiz but it is indicative of the problem with
any online learning resource and I and I&#39;m sure others find it
frustrating.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t want to come down hard on the lecturer or whomever made the
quiz question. In a class I might ask a question poorly but I have an
immediate feedback loop and can fix things right then and
there. Frustration doesn&#39;t build and in the case of holes in  important
conceptual material deficiencies don&#39;t develop.
</p>
<p>
I also don&#39;t want to come down on free resources that I use and
benefit from.
</p>
<p>
These types of issues seem small and the autodidacts that succeed in
using MOOCS work around them but if you look at these materials
critically as a teacher it&#39;s plain to see that their no substitute for
the real thing.
