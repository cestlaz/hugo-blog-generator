<p>
That's how I introduce myself whenever I attend a former student's
wedding. It leads to all sorts of confusion.
</p>

<p>
Even better was the time I was at the wedding of two former
students. I had just dropped around 65 pounds and was wearing my hair
differently. I sat at a table filled with former students that didn't
recognize me &#x2013; they had no reason to expect me, out of context and
all. I joined the conversation - able to go toe to toe on stories of
"the old days at Stuy." It really confused them. We all had a good
laugh when I outed myself.
</p>

<p>
Over the years, a many of my graduates have moved from student to
friend and I've shared life events with a number of them. Rule one is
that I don't reach out to them after graduation - that would just be
creepy. If, however, they reach out to me, then we stay in touch. As
an educator, even if it's a periodic note or update, it's something
that really touches me - it reminds me that even with all the teacher
bashing going on in this country, the kids, at least some of the time,
appreciate us.
</p>

<p>
This weekend was particularly memorable for me. I was at JonAlf and Jamie's
wedding. JonAlf falls in a special category.
</p>

<p>
He was a former student and also on my fencing teams. I don't remember
how much we stayed in touch, but it must have been enough for me to
know that he minored in CS and was teaching high school at Brandeis.
</p>

<p>
When I heard Brandeis was being phased out and I saw we had a couple
of math openings, I tried to find him to bring him over to Stuy. You
try finding JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver in "the system." Is it Jon Dyrland?
Alf Weaver?  JonAlf Dyrland? Nothing worked. In any event I did
eventually find him. Unfortunately, I wasn't allowed to bring him on
in spite of his being a Stuy graduate with a CS background and a
successful teaching record. Nonetheless I kept trying and a couple of
years later I got him.
</p>

<p>
Since then, JonAlf has been my partner in crime. A kindred spirit whom
I describe him as a younger hipper version of me although the hip bar
was set pretty low to begin with.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the lunacy - The Blues Brothers, Austin Powers and
Dr. Evil, Clyde "Thluffy" Sinclair, the CS Semi Formal and all, he's
one of the best teachers I know.  A former student that I'm now proud
to call friend and colleague.
</p>

<p>
I was touched to be included in the festivities this weekend. I'm
incredibly proud of JonAlf as a teacher, a person, and a friend. He
and Jamie looked so happy together and I just know that their union
will be as amazing as Devorah and mine has been.
</p>

<p>
So this post is my way of raising a glass to JonAlf and Jamie.
