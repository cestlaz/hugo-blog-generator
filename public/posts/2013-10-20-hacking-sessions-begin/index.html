            <p>Yesterday was my 46th birthday. How did I spend it?  Well, 20
&ldquo;Hackers&rdquo; from 9 schools, 4 student TAs and a few of us teachers
gathered at <a href="http://sumall.com">SumAll</a> to kick off CSTUY&rsquo;s first
weekly program - Hacking Sessions (sometimes called Hackers Sessions).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was the first week so it was mostly mixers, setting up machines
(installing Linux on 24 laptops takes time) and going over how we&rsquo;ll
be communicating but I&rsquo;m really excited about the weeks to come. We
all expect to hit the ground running this coming Saturday.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy for a Stuyvesant student to become part of the Stuy CS
family. Most students at other schools aren&rsquo;t lucky enough to have
that type of critical mass. Typically they&rsquo;re one of a few techie
students and if they&rsquo;re lucky there will be maybe one teacher who&rsquo;s
really knowledgeable and passionate about CS and tech in general.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re hoping that this is going to change that. These 20 hackers
represent the start of a community for student hackers &ndash; taking what
we&rsquo;ve developed at Stuy outside the confines of the school.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Davin and everyone at <a href="http://sumall.com">SumAll</a>
for providing not only space but an amazingly welcoming and friendly
environment and also Fanming for coming up with the laptops.</p>
