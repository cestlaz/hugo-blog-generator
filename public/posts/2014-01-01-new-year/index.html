            <p>I&rsquo;ve never been one for New Year&rsquo;s resolutions.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m working on something specific, I might set a goal to finish it,
but the idea of goals for a year never struck a chord with me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the things that I find absurd about the current teacher
rating system - I have to decided on my three goals for the year. I
always have one goal with respect to my profession - to be better at
it.</p>
<p>In any event, even though I don&rsquo;t have specific overall goals for me,
there are some projects that I plan on pouring myself into this year.</p>
<p>The year closed with a lot of national hype over CS Ed. What remains
to be seen is where we go with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll continue to try to work within the system - try to convince the
new administration that supporting and replicating Stuy CS is something worth
doing but I&rsquo;ve been burnt enough to know not to
put all my eggs in that basket.</p>
<p>Consequently, I&rsquo;m hoping to put a lot of time into
<a href="http//cstuy.org">CSTUY</a>. We&rsquo;re just about a year old and it&rsquo;s been a
slow road but we&rsquo;re making some real progress - and this is just as a
grass roots organization - it&rsquo;s just us and the StuyCS Alumni family.</p>
<p>So, what are the plans?</p>
<p>#####More Hacking Sessions</p>
<p>We started Hacking Sessions in October. Twenty New York City public
high school students getting together to geek out and do CS every
Saturday. We&rsquo;re off to a great start but there&rsquo;s a lot of work to be
done. We&rsquo;d love to get more students involved in the coming semester.</p>
<p>#####Start Summer Hackers</p>
<p>This is the big effort. A summer program. Since we designed and
implemented Google CAPE NYC back in 2010, I&rsquo;ve known the effect you
can have with a strong summer program taught by master teachers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got the teachers and the program, but it&rsquo;s still going to take a
lot of work.We have yet to finalize on a location (we have a tentative
offer for space but I&rsquo;m hesitant to say anything until it&rsquo;s more
concrete) and we have to do it early enough so that we can get to the
students.</p>
<p>If we can get CSTUY&rsquo;s Summmer Hackers off the ground I&rsquo;m pretty sure
we can use that to launch a community of both hackers and teachers
just as we&rsquo;ve done at Stuy.</p>
<p>#####Get more people involved</p>
<p>I said that so far CSTUY has been grass roots only. In order for us to
succeed, we&rsquo;ll need to grow our community. The hope and plan is to get
the NY Tech community behind our efforts. I&rsquo;m hoping that when they see
us taking our proven programs out from Stuy to the greater public
they&rsquo;ll come out in droves.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s the hope.</p>
<p>So, those are my goals for the year.</p>
<p>Should be exiting.</p>
