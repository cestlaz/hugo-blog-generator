Just for some quick context. The process I started to describe in the
last post and continue here chronicles what I did at Stuy with high
schoolers. Now that I&#39;m at Hunter college, I&#39;m adapting the process
but the overarching themes remain the same.

<p>
Now that your students have been pulling the classcode repo regularly
it&#39;s time to move to the next step - adding and pushing files to a
repo.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t claim to do this the &#34;right way&#34; or the best way but it&#39;s
worked for me and it&#39;s gotten my students up to speed.
</p>
<p>
I ease my students into adding and pushing files using git through
homework submission. I create a single repo, usually named
<strong><strong>submissions</strong></strong> and make a folder for each student underneath looking
something like this:
</p>
<div class="verse-block">
<p>
.
└── submissions
├── abram_sarah
├── chen_stuart
└── thompson_steve
</p>
</div>
<p>
Before going any further, let me clear up one thing. The repo is
public so all the students have access to each others work. I&#39;m OK
with that. We could have each student make their own repo and use git
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">submodules</a> to make a submissions repo but administration is much
trickier and we lose the chance to build a culture of cooperation and
trust. We can lock down our submission systems as much as we want. If
students want to share assignments there&#39;s nothing we can do about
it.
</p>
<p>
My preference is to try to build a culture that minimizes bad
behavior and rewards good behavior. I&#39;d rather see an incorrect
homework so that I can tell what we need to work on than a copied
perfect assignment. I&#39;d rather see students cite each other, share
properly, and support each other than copy in the shadows.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not naive enough to believe that copying doesn&#39;t happen in my
classes but I still prefer erring on the side of openness.
</p>
<p>
Once the repo is set up, I give all the students access. This is a
little onerous since I have to type each of their GitHub usernames
under the collaborators section of the submissions repo but I only
have to do this once a semester.
</p>
<p>
Then I teach the workflow. Assignments go into a file or folder under
their directory named ##_name where ## is the assignment number
(01,02,03, etc) and name is the assignment name. The student workflow
is:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
git pull
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
git add (sometimes)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
git commit
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
git push
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Since every student is working in their own directory, things
basically work.
</p>
<p>
The first issue that students come up with is when another student
pushes before another student. The second student merely has to do
another <strong><strong>git pull</strong></strong> before proceeding. This provides an easy
introduction to dealing with the distributed nature of git.
</p>
<p>
There will occasionally be other issues when students don&#39;t follow
procedure exactly so I&#39;ll have to fix the repo every now and then but
nothing too bad and each time is a opportunity to show the class:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
you can pretty much always restore and fix things once you commit
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
them.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
the specifics to fix things.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
There will be a few bumps in the road but after a few assignments the
sailing will be pretty smooth.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day, the students are a little closer to being fully
fluent using git, they&#39;re hopefully using each others code as
resources but in a proper way and since the students are all using a
consistent assignment naming convention I can use simple scripts and
shell commands to do all sorts of processing on assignments.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s the end of phase two. The next step  brings us to small
projects using git.
