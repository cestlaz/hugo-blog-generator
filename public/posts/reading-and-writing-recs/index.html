I&#39;ve been on both sides of the recommendation game. I currently read
all the recommendations for students who apply to my <a href="http://info.huntercs.org">honors CS program</a>
at Hunter and some of the ones written for the Macaulay Honors
program. I also read some for the CSTUY summer program. On the other
side, I&#39;ve written hundreds if not thousands of recs for seniors when
I was teaching at Stuy.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been meaning to write about recs  and when I saw <a href="http://avc.com/2018/01/some-thoughts-on-checking-references/">yesterday&#39;s post</a>
on AVC.com I thought now would be a good time. While the situation is
not quite the same, much of what Fred wrote resonated strongly with
me.
</p>
<p>
I wrote a lot of recs at Stuy. In a year after I taught juniors I&#39;d
typically end up writing for anywhere between 40 and 75 kids and each
kid would apply to between 5 and 15 schools. Some were accepted early
and in many cases you use the same rec without tweaking for all the
kid&#39;s applications but it&#39;s still an enormous load.
</p>
<p>
I also don&#39;t think I&#39;m particularly good at it. Writing doesn&#39;t come
naturally to. That said, I try to do an honest job.
</p>
<p>
The first and most important thing I do is make sure each student
understands that I&#39;m not trying to get that kid into their percieved
dream school. My job writing a rec is to contribute to a picture of
who they are as both a student and as a person. The hope is that the
college admissions people will be looking for best fit students and
that the picture the application creates makes the fit clear
[fn:1:Personally, I think the whole college application process is
both unfair and arbitrary but that&#39;s a discussion for another time.].
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, I try to say something personal in each rec. Recount a
particular project or event. It&#39;s hard. It might be easier for
English teachers - English classes allow for much freer discussions
and assignments where students can reveal more about
themselves. It&#39;s harder in subjects like Math and Computer
Science. I&#39;d invariably be asked to write recs for a number of kids –
good kids that were quiet, did there thing but to be honest, never
did much to stand out. I don&#39;t necessity mean stand out in terms of
grades, I mean in terms of making themselves known - revealing who
they were. I also try to keep recs short. Readers have a lot of these
to go through. I don&#39;t want to add to their load.
</p>
<p>
Many teachers, including myself try to address this problem. We
interview the kids, have them write mini-essays and just plain
struggle when it comes time to write.
</p>
<p>
To make it more challenging, the deadlines are all together so you
have to get them all done in a short period of time and at the same
time not fall into the rut of having them sound all the same.
</p>
<p>
On the reader side, similar to what Fred said about references, a lot
of it is about what isn&#39;t written and about how it&#39;s written. The
challenge is that my code as a reader might be different from the
teacher writing the rec.
</p>
<p>
The key thing I look for when reading is a connection between the
writer and the kid. Often I read a rec and could apply it equally well
to every applicant in the stack. I also know that when I write recs
I&#39;ve been guilty of this and it really does nothing to help the
student.
</p>
<p>
I also don&#39;t want to read about averages and test scores or anything
that&#39;s already covered in the application. I already get the numbers
and if a kid, let&#39;s say, volunteered at a community center, it&#39;s already on the
application. I don&#39;t want a teacher to mention it unless they
were involved or can otherwise add something that I wouldn&#39;t know just
from reading the appkication.
</p>
<p>
If I come away feeling that there&#39;s a connection between the teacher
and student that says a lot to me. It means the kid made an impression
on the teacher.
</p>
<p>
For my Hunter Honors program I have an advantage (or possibly curse)
over when I read for other programs and this is similar to what Fred
wrote about following up on references. I know some of the teachers
writing the recs and I usually know teachers in the schools. Since the
number of applications I&#39;m dealing with isn&#39;t huge, I can reach out to
my people and find out what&#39;s what. Last year I was able to justify
accepting a student based on additional information I was able to get
and now half a year later it&#39;s clear that the student is a terrific
fit.
</p>
<p>
This would all be simpler if we didn&#39;t have to play games with
recommendations. When I was a teacher. rather than writing 50 - 70
recommendations, I&#39;d rather have 20ish phone calls. One with each
school. I could briefly talk about the kids relative to each other and
to former students who went to any given institution and that&#39;s
that. It would be faster, easier, and fairer.
