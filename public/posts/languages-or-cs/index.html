<p>
I always use that line to emphasize that I teach CS - a way of
thinking and problem solving and looking at the world. The languages
we use in our classes are tools to help us communicate ideas not the
ends but rather a means.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve spent the past couple of days at the CSTA conference. It&#39;s been a
lot of fun. I&#39;ve been spending the time with old friends and meeting
new ones and as everyone who knows me knows - I love talking shop.
</p>
<p>
I overheard a conversation today. One CS teacher describing what they
did to a few others. I overheard:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We teach Scratch then Swift and C++ and also teach Python
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I heard statements like this describing programs more than a couple of
times. I know we&#39;re at a conference of CS Educators but even in this
community we have everything from beginners getting their feet wet to
hardcore computer scientists to everything in between.
</p>
<p>
We shouldn&#39;t be teaching languages as an ends unto themselves and the
majority of us don&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
What many of us do, though, is take the easy path and use the name of
a programming language to describe what we do rather than really
define what we do. This is why we hear &#34;I teach Java&#34; or &#34;I teach a
class in Swift&#34; even when the teacher teaching Java might really be
teaching Object Oriented program design and development or data
structures or something similar just using Java as the language or
tool.
</p>
<p>
I too fall into this trap but I try to catch myself. I try not to say
&#34;I teach Scheme&#34; but rather I&#39;ll say &#34;I teach Scheme. Actually, we&#39;re
studying functional programming using Scheme as the language but for
convenience, I&#39;ll just say Scheme for the rest of this talk….&#34;
</p>
<p>
The words we use to describe our field set the tone. If we&#39;re sloppy
and say &#34;we teach Java,&#34; it&#39;s just like biology teacher saying &#34;I
teach microscope.&#34;
</p>
<p>
As we try to define our field in the K12 space and seek equal footing
with established subject areas it&#39;s important that we use the right
language so that other educators and policy makers don&#39;t get the wrong
idea.
