Like many of my fellow bloggers and tweeters, I generally keep this
site clear of political issues with the exception of those that are
directly related to education.
</p>
<p>
Also, like many of my fellow bloggers and tweeters, this week has
provided a reason to break with that tradition.
</p>
<p>
Many people, including some friends, all more eloquent than I have
already posted, tweeted, and Facebooked  about the behavior of our
President and government.
</p>
<p>
Long time blogger <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner">Dave Winer</a> put together <a href="http://trumpstatus.org/">trumpstatus.org</a> where he&#39;s
collecting many of the issues that we&#39;re all so alarmed with.
</p>
<p>
I would add cabinet appointments to his list with my particular
personal concern over DeVos and the department of education. I&#39;ve been
meaning to blog about that for a while - perhaps this week.
</p>
<p>
My concern for today is something else. Every day, I see a new Trump
induced crisis and every day I see a different subset of my circles
respond. It&#39;s not quite as bad as:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Socialist.
</p>
<p>
Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.
</p>
<p>
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Jew.
</p>
<p>
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
People are indeed speaking out, but I am concerned that people
are going to rise up for their personal issue and when placated go
back to business as usual - this is <strong><strong>NOT</strong></strong> the time for business as
usual.
</p>
<p>
With the ACA repeal, I saw concerns from my working class friends and
friends that work with lower earning populations.
</p>
<p>
Going into the DeVos hearing, mostly educators - real educators not
astroturf reformers.
</p>
<p>
With Friday&#39;s order, the whole tech community came out.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s part of a thread by tech activist <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash">Anil Dash</a> calling out,
calling on, and crediting assorted tech players.
</p>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When net neutrality was the issue, Google, Twitter, Wikipedia, Reddit, Tumblr, etc. had a blackout, and it worked. This is far more grave.</p>&mdash; Anil Dash (@anildash) <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/825414889908928517">January 28, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A powerful, straightforward statement from the CEO of Box — another publicly-traded company. <a href="https://t.co/wz5mQmTh6P">https://t.co/wz5mQmTh6P</a></p>&mdash; Anil Dash (@anildash) <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/825470308463280130">January 28, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>
We have to remember that all these order, policies, appointments, and
plans are coming from the same place - Donald Trump and those
politicians that are enabling him.
</p>
<p>
If he backs off on immigration, education issues remain, if he backs
off there, we still have ACA, if that eases up, what about Women&#39;s
rights and on and on.
</p>
<p>
This means we all have to get involved and stay involved.
</p>
<p>
What have I been doing?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
I finally joined the ACLU and set up a monthly donation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I subscribed to <a href="https://dailyaction.org">Daily Action</a> so that I get a reminder each day of
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
someone I can call to make a difference.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
I&#39;m starting to accumulate my representatives phone numbers as I
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
make those calls and am trying to make at least a call a day to
remind our representatives who they work for.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Education and advocacy
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And if you suggestions for me - please post them here.
</p>
<p>
Thus ends my not business as usual post. What&#39;s going on in America is
not someone else&#39;s problem - it&#39;s all of our problem and we all have
to be active and vigilant to make it through tough times to come.
