We all love interesting problems. The trouble is that it&#39;s hard to
find suitably interesting problems for students when they&#39;re just
learning the basics. In the very beginning the problems practically
dictate the solution:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
loop over a list and add all the elements or calculate the sum of a
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
list of integers.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Determine if  number is prime
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Convert a word into pig-Latin
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It&#39;s not that there&#39;s no thought involved in solving these but the
students already know the mechanics of solving these by hand so it&#39;s a
direct translation into a program.
</p>
<p>
This isn&#39;t a bad thing and it is important but it&#39;s fun when we get to the next
level. I&#39;ve found that a number of the <a href="http://hackerrank.com">Hacker Rank</a> archived
competitions have &#34;easy&#34; problems that can be a good fit for
beginners. One that I found and really like is <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/happy-ladybugs">Happy Ladybugs</a> problem.
</p>
<p>
The problems is basically as follows:
</p>
<p>
You get a string of letters. Each letter represents a ladybug of a
different color. Each letter also represents a location of the
ladybug.  A space (or underscore in the actual problem) represents a
free space. For example &#34;AABC DDA&#34; is a line of 2 A colored ladybugs
followed by a B colored one, C colored one, a blank space, 2 D colored and then one
more A colored.
</p>
<p>
You can rearrange the line of ladybugs by swapping any ladybug with a
blank space.
</p>
<p>
A ladybug is happy if it is next to another ladybug of the same
color. The challenge is to determine if all the ladybugs can be made
happy.
</p>
<p>
I like this problem because while it is non-trivial it is very
approachable.
</p>
<p>
To me, the key is that while you can rearrange the list you
don&#39;t have to. You only have to determine if it is possible to make
the ladybugs happy. You don&#39;t actually have to do so.
</p>
<p>
The edge cases are pretty easy to deal with - a string of length one
or two but then a little thought is required.
</p>
<p>
The first insight is that if there are no spaces, you can&#39;t rearrange
the ladybugs so all you have to do is scan through the string to test
to see if every ladybug has a neighbor of the same color.
</p>
<p>
The next insight, and the big one is that if you have at least one
space you can arbitrarily re-order the string. You can show this is
possible  by using a single space to swap any two elements.
</p>
<div class="src src-python">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
The final insight is that since you can arbitrarily re-order the
ladybugs as long as you have at least 2 of each color, you can make
them all happy.
</p>
<p>
Since my class is currently just starting dictionaries in Python we
solved this with lists and then transitioned to dictionaries.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s a dictionary based solution:
</p>
<div class="src src-python">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
I love problems like these.
</p>
<p>
I just wish there was an easy way to find all contest problems of a
certain level like &#34;easy&#34; or &#34;medium.&#34; If anybody knows please share
in the comments.
