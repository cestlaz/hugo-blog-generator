A few weeks ago I wrote about <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/testing-testing/#.Wq7Ud3XwZhE">introducing testing</a> in CS classes,
specifically using a testing framework. In that post I talked about
the plan but now I can talk about the results.
</p>
<p>
My class interleaves with Hunter&#39;s CSCI 13500 - Software Analysis and
Design I class. One day each week, my students have complete a hands
on lab focusing on whatever is being covered in the 13500 class. I
decided to use one of those labs as a first foray into testing.
</p>
<p>
I had each student use a classmates lab solution. They were to examine
their solution and write a test suite for the lab using the <a href="https://github.com/onqtam/doctest">doctest</a>
C++ testing framework.
</p>
<p>
I think this proved to be a valuable exercise.
</p>
<p>
Partway into the exercise, a few students independently had an issue -
they couldn&#39;t even build the tests.
</p>
<p>
The code looked right. Something like this:
</p>
<div class="src src-c++">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c++" data-lang="c++">
</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
It looked like at textbook example of a test case but it wouldn&#39;t even
compile.
</p>
<p>
In all cases, the original student code compiled and ran and gave the
correct result. All the students had code similar to this:
</p>
<div class="src src-c++">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c++" data-lang="c++">
</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
This stumped everyone for a while - why wouldn&#39;t the test even
compile.
</p>
<p>
The answer was &#34;data types.&#34; The lab specification required that
getValue was supposed to return a <code>double</code> but in all the problem
cases, the student returned a <code>std::string</code>. The lab appeared to work
since <code>std::cout</code> handles strings as well as numeric data types but
once they put it in to a test case that actually checked types the
problem was apparent and easy to fix.
</p>
<p>
As it turns out, I was pretty excited about this – even before
finishign the tests, the act of writing tests revealed a problem. This
is a good thing.
</p>
<p>
From there, it was pretty easy for students to finish writing the
tests for their classmates labs.
</p>
<p>
Fast forward a week. This was the first lab where I required
the students to submit their own test suite as part of their lab. This
didn&#39;t seem to slow anyone down by an appreciable and time will tell
if this leads to better development practices but it certainly made my
life easier. I was able to quickly move from repo to repo and type:
</p>
<div class="src src-bash">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">make tests
./tests -s
... watch the tests run
make
./main
--- watch the program run</code></pre></div></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Easy peasy.
</p>
<p>
Not only did it make it faster for me, it also gave me insights into
their programs by seeing their decisions in terms of test writing.
</p>
<p>
Is it a win?
</p>
<p>
At the very worst, they&#39;re learning an
industry practice and at best, it&#39;s going to help them improve as
software engineers. Add on the fact that it&#39;s making my life as a
teacher easier both in terms of understanding the students work and in
terms of speed of evaluation. Sounds like a win to me.
