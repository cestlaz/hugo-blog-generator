<p>
Both at and prior to SIGCSE 2017, I promised to write up the steps I
take to introduce and use revision control systems in my classes.
</p>
<p>
This series is not meant to be a git or <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> tutorial. There are
plenty of those already (two of which I&#39;ve linked to below).  This is
about the process I use with my students to get them up to speed.
</p>
<p>
As with any new tool, there will be some resistance but once git saves
them once, they get religion. There will also be some bumps in the
road but at the end of the day, the students will be using a valuable
and necessary tool.
</p>
<p>
I was also surprised at the ancillary benefits I got as a teacher by
using GitHub in particular. I&#39;ll talk about that at the end of the
series.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s part one.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m doing this with git and GitHub but there&#39;s no reason why other
systems and hosts can&#39;t be used. I&#39;d also recommend that any educator
or student sign up for the assorted <a href="https://education.github.com/">discounts</a> offered by GitHub.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve followed this basic idea multiple times and done it over the
course of a single semester, a year, and even two years. Regardless of
time frame, the idea is the same. Make each step simple and relevant
and introduce complexity and roadblocks a piece at a time.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-1">
Step 1 - code distribution
</h2>
<p>
To start, I don&#39;t even talk about version control. We start with code
distribution. For years, I&#39;ve looked for efficient ways of sharing
code with my classes. Both code developed in class and code for
assignments.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve tried things like NFS, Dropbox, online code repositories like the
files section of systems like Moodle or Blackboard.
</p>
<p>
At Stuy, we&#39;ve always had efficiency problems with NFS and Dropbox has
multiple problems ranging from students not being able to install the
client on school machines to the problems of the network hit when a
room full of kids are syncing at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Uploading to a CMS system was also problematic - I&#39;m a command line
wonk and hate going through slow web page menus to navigate a
filesystem and upload files. I also had to remember to get the files
off of whatever machine I was working on in class and then transfer
them to the CMS when I had a free moment.
</p>
<p>
Enter git. Now, of course, if you&#39;re going to use git in the classroom
you have to know it. There are plenty of resources out there. Online
courses, articles, videos, and tutorials. Here are a couple:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://try.github.io/">https://try.github.io/</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE</a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I also want to point out that I just use raw command line git along
with native GitHub. GitHub has rolled out <a href="https://classroom.github.com/">GitHub Classroom</a> which adds
a layer of support for educators. I don&#39;t use it because, as I said,
I&#39;m an old school command line wonk and also because I figured out a
sequence that worked for me and my students before GitHub Classroom
existed. Were I starting now, I&#39;d take some time to look at their
current offerings before jumping in.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-2">
Set up
</h3>
<p>
Before starting, make sure you register your ssh keys. <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/">This</a> help page
has more information. You&#39;ll want to register an ssh key from every
machine you use - home, work, laptop.
</p>
<p>
Now go over to GitHub and make a new repository. I usually name it
<strong><strong>classcode</strong></strong>. <strong><strong>BEGINNER NOTE:</strong></strong> when creating the repo, make sure to
check the &#34;initialize this repository with a README&#34; box. If you don&#39;t
you&#39;ll be given a set of instructions on how to set things up once you
click <strong><strong>Create repository</strong></strong> but it&#39;s easier and easier to follow if
you start with an initialized repo with a README.
</p>
<p>
I make the repo public – it&#39;s code I&#39;m distributing – nothing to
hide here. If you aren&#39;t comfortable with that, just make the repo
private. If you&#39;ve registered as a teacher with GitHub, you can set up
an organization and you&#39;ll be able to set up free private repos within
it. The other downside here is that you&#39;ll have to individually give
each student access to the repo. That&#39;s a mild annoyance but it only
has to be done once.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-3">
Teacher use
</h3>
<p>
Next, clone out the repo. <strong><strong>BEGINNER NOTE:</strong></strong> Make sure you check out
the ssh version not the https version. Just make sure that when you
click the <strong><strong>clone</strong></strong> button, it says &#34;Clone with SSH.&#34; If not, just
click the &#34;Use SSH&#34; link in the same box. Students will clone the
using https.
</p>
<p>
From the teacher point of view, you can just start using the repo. My
work flow is typically:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong><strong>git pull</strong></strong> at the start of class
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
write code throughout class
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong><strong>git add</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>git commit</strong></strong>, and <strong><strong>git push</strong></strong> at the end of class
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I use a similar flow when I want to add files in my office or at home.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-4">
Student use
</h3>
<p>
From the student point of view, assuming a public repo, they just have to clone the repo and
at the beginning of every class or work session, do a <strong><strong>git
pull</strong></strong>. That&#39;s all there is to it.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-5">
Thoughts
</h3>
<p>
That&#39;s it. The kids are now using GitHub – they&#39;re probably looking
at and poking around on the web site as well as pulling files to their
machines. You can also, in class, show things like <strong><strong>git status</strong></strong>,
<strong><strong>git log</strong></strong>, and <strong><strong>git diff</strong></strong> to set the stage for step 2 of this
process and beyond.
</p>
<p>
Since the students aren&#39;t adding, committing or pushing, you probably won&#39;t
get any errors.
</p>
<p>
The only problem that could reasonably occur is if a student places a
file in their local copy of the repo with the same name as something
they haven&#39;t pulled yet. This is pretty easy to address and provides a
nice stepping stone lesson to again, set the stage for more complex
operations.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m happy with this as a first step towards git using GitHub. It
provides a nice way of sharing class code while gently introducing the
students to the tool.
</p>
<p>
The next step  is having the students add files to a repo. That&#39;s the
next post in this series.
