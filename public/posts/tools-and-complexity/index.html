<a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo">Alfred Thompson</a> wrote about <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2018/04/thoughts-on-where-cs-education-tools.html">CS education tools</a> earlier today. I&#39;ve
also been meaning to write on the topic but from a different point of
view.
</p>
<p>
I do my best to keep up with the latest and greatest in the CS world
both on the academic side as well as the professional one. That&#39;s not
really possible, but I do my best. When I have a small project to work
on I&#39;ll some times use it as an excuse to play with some recent
technology. Over December, I wanted to write an application viewer to
use for company / student internship matching. I started by looking at
<a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> but ended up using <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> which I liked much more for a variety
of reasons.
</p>
<p>
The viewer served it&#39;s purpose but I think it can be turned into a
much more comprehensive student / employer internship platform. I
tried to steal a few minutes over this past week&#39;s spring break to
start a rewrite using another toolset, Clojure, Clojurescript and
Reagent. I&#39;m really liking the Clojure stack and using
Emacs and Cider for the IDE is really blowing me away.
</p>
<p>
What I&#39;ve noticed is that for every new language of framework you also
have to learn a whole set of ancillary tools.
</p>
<p>
It didn&#39;t used to be that way. Back in the day, things were much
simpler. I remembering doing work at Goldman Sachs, it was as simple
as typing something on the command line like <code>cc file1.c file2.c
file3.c</code>. I of course had to be cutting edge and use fancy modern
tools like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</a>. What&#39;s more, the tools I used in industry were very
similar to what I used in college.
</p>
<p>
We now live in very different times.
</p>
<p>
If you go to the getting started guides for React or Vue it&#39;s pretty easy to
get hello world up and running but beyond that you start to fall in to
the Javascript tooling hole. To start you need either <strong>npm</strong> or <strong>yarn</strong>
just to manage packages and dependencies. Then you need a build system
or bundler like <strong>webpack</strong>, <strong>browserify</strong>, or <strong>parcel</strong> and that&#39;s not even
considering older options like <strong>gulp</strong> and <strong>grunt</strong> and ancillary tools
like <strong>babel</strong>.
</p>
<p>
A typical React or Vue project is going to need a <a href="https://github.com/krasimir/react-webpack-starter/blob/master/package.json">project.json</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/krasimir/react-webpack-starter/blob/master/webpack.config.js">webpack.config.js</a> file and sometimes some other files as well. Check
out the links. They&#39;re from a simple project template I found
online. Far from simple.
</p>
<p>
When I was playing with Vue.js a couple of months ago, I ended up
using Webpack to convert the source code into the final JS, take care
of live-reloading, and in general manage the project. I still have no
idea how most of it works. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me but I&#39;m very
uncomfortable relying on tools that I really don&#39;t fully understand to
build my systems.
</p>
<p>
The Clojure world is little better with Leiningen and Boot. If you
don&#39;t believe me, try to make heads or tails of <a href="https://github.com/bhauman/figwheel-template/blob/master/src/leiningen/new/figwheel/project.clj">this</a>.
</p>
<p>
While it&#39;s true that as a professional you&#39;ll likely use one set of
tools on a day to day basis and you&#39;ll eventually get to know them
that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a good idea to prepare kids for what&#39;s to
come.
</p>
<p>
On the K12 side we have drag and drop languages, specialized learning
IDEs like BlueJ, simple cut down IDEs like Dr Racket and completely
online environments like repl.it. All great starter tools that
insulate beginners from the complexities to come. College&#39;s
might get closer to the &#34;real world&#34; but just a tad.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like many of the tools used in K12
classes and there&#39;s far too much complexity in the professional world to
throw at beginners. If we look at a student&#39;s entire school
career, classes are already so packed with material it would be hard to
really prepare kids for the real world within their classes. You could
take that tried and true teacher / professor technique of just
requiring it and having the kids figure it out on their own but that&#39;s
really just downright abusive.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t have an answer for this one.
</p>
<p>
I have my kids use tools like Git and GitHub early along with using
testing frameworks and external libraries. I also try to move my
students to a general purpose programmable platform like Emacs or
Vim. I think these are sound practices but students will still have a
big learning curve when they finally get to industry.
</p>
<p>
What I really would love it to see the tooling become simpler and
documentation better. <a href="https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel">Parcel</a>, a Javascript bundler is one of the newer
kids on the block and is much simpler and cleaner than alternatives
like Webpack. The new version of Clojure has it&#39;s own command line
tool which is also simpler than the alternatives. Maybe we are already
moving in the right direction and this entire rant will become moot in a couple of years.
