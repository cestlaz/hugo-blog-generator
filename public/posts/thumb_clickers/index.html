Last Friday, <a href="https://twitter.com/guzdial">Mark Guzdial</a> wrote about the woes of <a href="https://computinged.wordpress.com/2017/03/31/the-need-for-better-software-and-systems-to-support-active-cs-learning/%0A">using clickers</a> in a
class. The amount of effort required to use his school&#39;s approved
clicker technology sounds ridiculous so while we need tools to better
engage students in large class settings we need better tools that can
be integrated into our classes more easily.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve never used clickers. On top of stories like Mark&#39;s, there are  a
number of problems with using clickers in a public school.
</p>
<p>
You can&#39;t force students to buy them and in NYC, until recently,
students couldn&#39;t use their phones (which they also might not have).
Forgetting the expense, if the school provides them, is it one per
student? If so, who&#39;s going to administer the clicker to student
mapping and how will that be communicated to the teachers. If college
tech infrastructures are sometimes lacking, high schools are orders of
magnitudes worse. The resources just aren&#39;t there. Then we have to
deal with loss and breakage.
</p>
<p>
If a teacher somehow gets a class set of clickers, they have to deal
with mapping clickers to students for all of their classes and make
sure the right student has the right clicker. Again, loss  and
breakage is a problem.
</p>
<p>
Then you have to create the question content and hope that everything
works in class.
</p>
<p>
The value added given the overhead just doesn&#39;t seem worth it
particularly since high school classes, while large, are not in the
hundreds and there are other methods of student engagement.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s what I use instead. It&#39;s not perfect but it&#39;s low cost and low
effort with a pretty high return.
</p>
<p>
The basic configuration, is a simple three state broadcast device.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not without its problems and I don&#39;t think it would work as well
in a large lecture but given the cost, it&#39;s well worth it.
</p>
<p>
So, what is it?
</p>
<img src="/img/thumbs/fonzup.jpg" alt="/img/thumbs/fonzup.jpg" title="/img/thumbs/fonzup.jpg" align="center"/>
<p>
Thumbs.
Periodically, I&#39;ll poll my class.
</p>
<p>
&lt;span&gt;
&lt;img width=&#34;30%&#34;src=&#34;file:/img/thumbs/sidethumb.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img width=&#34;30%&#34; src=&#34;file:/img/thumbs/upthumb.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img width=&#34;30%&#34; src=&#34;file:/img/thumbs/downthumb.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/spam&gt;
</p>
<p>
Thumb to the side? Everything&#39;s OK. Keep going as you&#39;re going. I get
it. Basically, things are good.
</p>
<p>
Thumb up? Speed up, you&#39;re going too slow, I got it five minutes ago or
some similar big positive.
</p>
<p>
Thumb down? I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s cheap, easy, quick, and once you can get your class to buy in,
you can get a quick sense of the class.
</p>
<p>
The downsides?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The class has to have a level of comfort so that students vote
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
honestly and don&#39;t just give you positive feedback.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
No data collection.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The upsides?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
quick
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
cheap
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
works on any topic on the fly
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
even if the votes are artificially skewed towards positive, it does
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
forces the class to be at least a little attentive and to engage in
some physical response
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
can get analog responses by allowing students to adjust wrist
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
rotation
</p>
<p>
As to the redundancy? I&#39;ve never had a kid leave their thumb at home
or lose it and even if they did, they&#39;ve got a second hand.
</p>
<img src="/img/thumbs/fonztwo.jpg" alt="/img/thumbs/fonztwo.jpg" title="/img/thumbs/fonztwo.jpg" align="center" height="200"/>
<p>
This also works in extreme environments. Try using a clicker or mobile
app with gloves or mittens on or underwater.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t teach large lectures so I don&#39;t know how this would work in a
huge class. I&#39;d imagine it&#39;s still worth it given that it&#39;s so low
friction and low cost of entry even if it&#39;s not perfect.
