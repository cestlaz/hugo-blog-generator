I spent the last couple of days attending <a href="http://go.personaldemocracy.com/">Personal Democracy Forum
2016</a>, described on their landing site as:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The world’s leading conference exploring and analyzing technology&#39;s
impact on politics, government, and society.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That&#39;s the reason why I haven&#39;t posted my latest Emacs video.
</p>
<p>
PDF is a great conference and raised a huge number of important
issues. I&#39;ll probably blog about a few over the next few weeks.
</p>
<p>
One topic that I&#39;ve already lamented about has been the way we as a
society are allowing so much information to be silo-ed in platforms
like Facebook.
</p>
<p>
I use Facebook as much as the next guy but it always irks me when I
see a CS Education post followed by rich discussion hidden within
Facebook&#39;s walls and not available for discovery to the outside world
and the future.
</p>
<p>
I generally don&#39;t get a lot of comments on my posts, but when I do,
more appear in the Facebook link to my post rather than publicly on
the post itself.
</p>
<p>
At the conference, we watched a video by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hossein_Derakhshan">Hossein Derakhshan</a> which
talked about the direction the web is moving in and the red flags it
should raise with all of us. He echoed my concerns and beyond but in a much more
eloquent way.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m urging you to take the less than ten minutes to watch this
video. I know school&#39;s winding down for all of us but for those of you
who are teachers out there - share this with your students. I&#39;m sure a
rich discussion will follow.
