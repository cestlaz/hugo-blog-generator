This morning, <a href="https://twitter.com/guzdial">Mark Guzdial</a> wrote about <a href="https://computinged.wordpress.com/2018/04/27/lack-of-funding-leads-to-lack-of-teachers-leads-to-lack-of-cs-classes-we-may-need-to-change-our-strategy/">unfunded mandates and CS for
All</a>. Unfunded mandates frequently wreak havoc on schools in a number
of ways but in the long run, I don&#39;t think it should have a severe
effect on CS for All. Rather, it could have a big impact on the number
of CS courses we offer beyond that.
</p>
<p>
Mark relay&#39;s a story from the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School where
at the time many students wanted more CS classes but the school wasn&#39;t
planning on hiring a new CS teacher. The money quote is:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Over 50 percent of students signing up for Level 2 [computer science] courses next year identify as African Americans,
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
No, I&#39;m not talking about the diversity issue raised by the quote, I&#39;m
talking about <strong>Level 2 [computer science]</strong>. This implies that the
students already had <strong>Level 1 computer science</strong>. Level 1 would cover
CS For All so now we&#39;re talking about CS electives vs other
electives. This is something I had to deal with for most of my career
even after we got a CS requirement at Stuy. It was always a battle to
hire enough CS teachers to meet demand. The hard part was politics -
there were always older more entrenched subject areas who would rather
force kids into their electives rather than allow them to take my CS
electives. This is a whole other kettle of fish than CS for All. It&#39;s
an issue for some schools now and will become a <strong>BIG</strong> issue in five to
fifteen years when a single CS required course is more the norm. The
issue raised here is a new CS elective vs entrenched teachers and
classes which shuld lead to a discussion of the relative value of CS
electives vs other electives. That said, the reality is that it
usually comes down to school and local power and politics. Also to be
considered is the potential ebb and flow of interest - there might be
demand for 5 more CS classes and 5 less something else this year but
there might not be next year and then we&#39;re in real trouble staffing
wise.
</p>
<p>
Schools, public high schools in particular are zero sum endeavors. You
have a fixed number of periods a day, specific class requirements, and
certain mandates as to a the minimum and maximum number of classes a
student can take. In New York City, I believe students are required to
have a &#34;full&#34; schedule which basically means they can&#39;t come in for
English, Math, and History and then go home.
</p>
<p>
With CS for All, you&#39;re basically allocating reallocating some amount
of time to computer science. It might be hard to find a qualified
teacher. particularly in a small school where the population won&#39;t
support a full time CS teacher and it might ruffle the feathers of the
teachers that will be losing the time but it shouldn&#39;t make much of a
dent or really any dent on the budget.
</p>
<p>
Mark also raises the possibility of embedding CS into other subject
classes. <a href="http://www.bootstrapworld.org/">Bootstrap</a> is a program that I&#39;m rather fond of that does
just this in Algebra classes (although more recently they&#39;re working
to branch out into other subject areas). Even though I&#39;m a big
Bootstrap fan I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the answer to CS for All or CS in
the high schools in general. I think that one of the reasons why
Bootstrap works so well is the alignment between the CS tool they use
and the way Algebra is or can be taught. Another reason is the fact
that while Algebra is the lowest level of the traditional high school
classes, it&#39;s frequently the one for which the most time is
allocated. Students in low performing schools might take Algebra over
two years or have a double period. This won&#39;t be the case for other
subject areas. What this means is that there&#39;s more likely extra time
to embed another subject, cs, into the Algebra class. Long term,
embedding CS into another subject area requires:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
a teacher that really knows both subjects
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
enough time so you can add all the cool CS content while still
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
preparing the students for both the next level of whatever subject
you&#39;re embedded in  as well as for whatever standardized
assessments come at the end of the year.
</p>
<p>
As I said, I&#39;m a Bootstrap fan but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the answer for
CS in K12.
</p>
<p>
Back to the original topic there are certainly issues with
implementing CS for All but I don&#39;t think school funding is the
biggest hurdle. For me there are other big challenges. One is having a
supply of qualified teachers. In the long run as states outline CS
requirements and pre-service programs crop up this will work itself
out. Until then, yes, we will have an issue and yes it will take some
funding for stop gap and transitional teacher preperation. A second issue is
working the internal politics. Adding CS does mean removing something
else or more likely a piece of something else. The third one is what
I&#39;m noticing in NY where CS for all seems to at times forget about
the CS. If we have knowledgeable teachers we can work around that one
but I still think that might be my biggest concern.
