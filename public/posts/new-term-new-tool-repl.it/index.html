We&#39;re now a week in to my first class at Hunter. It&#39;s a little early
for me to really compare and contrast the high school to college
experience but I thought I&#39;d share some thoughts on a tool that I&#39;ve
recently started to play with.
</p>
<p>
My students were all supposed to be issued laptops at the beginning of
the semester. The plan was to have them learn Linux, the command line,
and a little DevOps along the way. I guess I shouldn&#39;t have been too
surprised to learn that the laptops weren&#39;t going to come in until
late September.
</p>
<p>
Scratch all that advance lesson planning. A brief scramble and I was
able to relocate the class into a computer lab but now we can&#39;t
customize the kids environments.
</p>
<p>
Time to look for an online solution.
</p>
<p>
We&#39;re starting the kids off in Python, a choice that I&#39;ll talk about
in some future post and normally my online go to for Python is
<a href="http://codesters.com">codesters.com</a>. I&#39;m a big fan of the codesters team and product. This
time, though, I decided to try something else. Specifically <a href="http://repl.it">repl.it</a>. Partly because, as with
codesters, I like the people behind it. It&#39;s also pretty simple and it
supports a lot of different languages:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
APL, ES2015 ,Bloop, BrainF, C, CoffeeScript, C++, C++11, C#, Emoticon,
Forth, F#, Go, Java, JavaScript, LOLCODE, Lua, Nodejs, PHP, Python,
Python3, QBasic, Roy, Ruby, Rust, Scheme, Swift, Unlambda, and HTML, CSS, JS
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It&#39;s still a pretty new product so there are occasional hiccups but
I&#39;m really liking things so far. Some of the things I like include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
a simple clean interface.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
sharing and embedding code:
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
&lt;script src=&#34;//repl.it/embed/DF3m/19.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
project mode which allows multi file projects
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
examples to get you started
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
But the thing I&#39;m really liking are the teacher features they&#39;re
working on. The teacher interface isn&#39;t fancy. I like that. Things are
simple and clean and they let me get the job done.
</p>
<p>
I had two extra minutes in class yesterday and in that time, I was
able to:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Make a classroom
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Invite all my students by email
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Create 2 quick assignments.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The assignment page lets you give starter code as well as instructions
and it also lets you put in tests that are run when a student submits
their work for instant feedback.
</p>
<p>
I really like the tests feature on projects. So far, I&#39;ve only played
with Python unit tests. Repl.it uses a really easy to follow
interface and has a sample test to guide you. There&#39;s also an option
for input/output matching which includes flexible matching and regular
expressions but I haven&#39;t played with it yet.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I&#39;m liking this tool. When the kids get their laptops we&#39;ll
probably use it somewhat less as they start to learn to use their own
systems but I&#39;m glad to have repl.it in my teaching arsenal.
