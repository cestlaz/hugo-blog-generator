One of my titles at Hunter College is Director of the Daedalus CS
Honors program. It&#39;s something like a Hunter specific, CS specific
version of the CUNY Macaulay Honors program.
</p>
<p>
Hunter gives all its students the ability to get a great computer
science education at a fraction of the cost of a private institution
and if you&#39;re a Daedalus scholar you also get a scholarship, a laptop,
special classes (with me :-) ), activities and more. Just the other
day we visited  <a href="http://samsungnext.com/">Samsung Next</a> accelerator and earlier in the year we
made our annual visit to <a href="http://www.catskillsconf.com/">Catskills Conf</a>, arguably my favorite event of
the year.
</p>
<p>
When deciding on which students to recommend for acceptance, I try to
glean as much information as I can about each applicant. When I feel
there&#39;s not enough information, I&#39;ve been known to reach out to
recommenders and other sources for more. But first I go through the
applications. For each student, I&#39;m provided with a pdf file with a
bunch of data and also an entry in an internal Hunter online form with
even more.
</p>
<p>
For the first cohort, this wasn&#39;t a big deal. I hadn&#39;t even started at
Hunter when the applications closed so there was no
outreach. Everything was after the fact so there were very few
students to evaluate.
</p>
<p>
Last year, I was able to do some outreach and we had around 60 or so
applications for a little over 20 spots.
</p>
<p>
This year, there are well over 100 applicants (and we&#39;re looking to
grow the program by a large number of students). All of a sudden, it
wasn&#39;t so easy to navigate all the pdf files.
</p>
<p>
Emacs to the rescue. Using a combination of org-mod,  <a href="https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools">pdf-tools</a>, and
<a href="https://melpa.org/#/org-pdfview">org-pdfview</a> I&#39;ve come up with a workflow that I very much like.
