When I started using git and GitHub with my students it was a natural
progression having started with started with CVS and then, as
technology changed moving through Subversion and then Mercurial. It
was all about using sensible professional software development
techniques while making it easier for students to submit work and for
me to evaluate their submissions.
</p>
<p>
Over time, I found that git and GitHub in fact provided some extra
support for educators right out of the box.
</p>
<p>
In my <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse-2017-github-3">last github post</a> I talked about using the results of <code>git log</code>
and looking at diffs. Both provide ways of seeing what a student did
and when. The commit log and history make it easier to hold students accountable to working
through a project and not leavings for the last minute. The diffs make
it easier to see what&#39;s changed both to see progress and also to help
support students as they develop their projects.
</p>
<p>
If you use Emacs, as I do, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/pidu/git-timemachine">git timemachine</a> package
which does a great job visualizing changes:
</p>
<img src="/img/sigcse-github/timemachine.gif" alt="/img/sigcse-github/timemachine.gif" title="/img/sigcse-github/timemachine.gif" align="center"/>
<p>
Other editors might have a similar feature.
</p>
<p>
The contribution graphs also provide a quick snapshot which shows what
team members are contributing and when:
</p>
<img src="/img/sigcse-github/githubgraph.png" alt="/img/sigcse-github/githubgraph.png" title="/img/sigcse-github/githubgraph.png" align="center"/>
<p>
The punchcard graph is also useful to see when students actually do
their work.
</p>
<img src="/img/sigcse-github/githubgraph2.png" alt="/img/sigcse-github/githubgraph2.png" title="/img/sigcse-github/githubgraph2.png" align="center"/>
<p>
GitHub also make it easy to set up starter code or to have students
&#34;take over&#34; each others projects by forking.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m very happy using git and GitHub as is but if you want more
support, check out <a href="https://classroom.github.com/">GitHub Classroom</a>. Had it existed when I started,
I&#39;d probably have used it but since I had already gotten used to my
work flows I&#39;ve stuck with raw git and github.
</p>
<p>
In case you missed the earlier posts describing the process I use to
introduce github to my classes here they are:

I&#39;m hoping some of you have found this set of four posts useful or at
least interesting.
