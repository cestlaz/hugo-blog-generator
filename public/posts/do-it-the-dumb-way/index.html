There&#39;s so much to like in the shape drawing lessons I talked about
in my <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/refactoring/">refactoring</a> post that I thought I&#39;d share a little more here.
</p>
<p>
It can be argued that the most important things for a program to do is work. The
most clever, elegant, creative program is worthless if it doesn&#39;t
produce the desired result. All too often, beginners and hot shot beginners in particular try to
be too clever too early and get themselves into trouble.
</p>
<p>
When doing the shape drawing lessons the first couple of shape are
pretty easy
</p>
<pre class="example">

| ****            |    | *               |
| ****            |    | **              |
| ****            |    | ***             |
| ****            |    | ****            |
| ****            |    |                 |
|                 |    |                 |
</pre>
<p>
but things get more interesting with the right justified triangle:
</p>
<pre class="example">
----*       *
---**      **
--***     ***
-****    ****
*****   *****
</pre>
<p>
For this triangle, students want to come up with the formula for the
number of spaces. They usually figure out something like this with
<code>h-i-1</code> spaces and <code>i+1</code> stars:
</p>
<div class="src src-c++">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c++" data-lang="c++">
</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
The formulas become harder to figure out as the shapes become more
complex and sometimes students get stymied.
</p>
<p>
The truth is that while they&#39;re struggling to find the perfect
solution, it&#39;s sometimes better to do it the dumb way.
</p>
<p>
Consider drawing a trapezoid like this example of height 5 and
starting width 12:
</p>
<pre class="example">
************
**********
********
******
****
</pre>
<p>
A student could come up with the &#34;formulas&#34; for spaces and stars but
sometimes there&#39;s a more straightforward way.
</p>
<p>
Consider the number of spaces on each line on the left hand side of
the shape. First line is 0 then 1, 2 etc. Why not start a variable
<code>spaces</code> at 0 and increment it on each loop iteration.
</p>
<p>
For the number of stars, it&#39;s starting at the width and being reduced
by 2 each time.
</p>
<p>
This leads to a solution similar to this (using the line routine from
the earlier refactoring post):
</p>
<div class="src src-c++">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c++" data-lang="c++">
</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
This solution is simple to construct, simple to understand, and quite
frankly, hard to get wrong.
</p>
<p>
It can also lead a student to discovering a pattern or &#34;formula&#34; such
as what was used to solve the earlier problems.
</p>
<p>
This might seem to some as a cheap way out, the dumb approach -
creating extra variables and have them count along the way but I
don&#39;t. There&#39;s nothing wrong with simple and straightforward. Yes, you
could come up with an elegant formula but the bottom line is you need
something to count 0,1,2,3… so create a variable to do it. You need
something to count 12,10,8,… create one for that as well.
</p>
<p>
Now, I&#39;m not advocating writing 100 if statements rather than a loop
but I think you get the idea.
</p>
<p>
The best solution is one that works and Sometimes the &#34;dumb&#34; approach is the best approach.
