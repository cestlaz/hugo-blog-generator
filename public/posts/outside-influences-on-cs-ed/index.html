Yesterday <a href="https://twitter.com/guzdial">Mark Guzdial</a> blogged about a NY Times piece discussing
<a href="https://computinged.wordpress.com/2017/07/28/silicon-valley-pushing-coding-into-american-classrooms-through-code-org-nytimes/">Silicon Valleys influence on education through Code.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
Mark questioned the validity of the piece. If you don&#39;t read Mark&#39;s
blog and you&#39;re in CS Ed you probably should.
</p>
<p>
I tried to leave a comment on Mark&#39;s blog - not about the NY Times
article but rather my thoughts on why I think it&#39;s important that we
remain wary and vigilant to industry and outsiders influence and
impact on CS education and on education in general.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know if my comment is sitting waiting for Mark to moderate or
if I&#39;m experiencing WordPress weirdness but since it hasn&#39;t shown up
there, I thought I&#39;d share it here:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
While the article might not make a strong case it&#39;s important to be wary of outside influences on education policies.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a fan of a lot of what code.org does but speaking about outsiders in general…
</p>
<p>
Bill Gates and Co. directly or indirecty gave us such delights like stack ranking teachers, improving, I mean evaluating, I mean firing teachers based on test scores of students they don&#39;t teach, more and more high stakes nonsense testing for kids, and  at least in NY the destruction of neighborhood schools.
</p>
<p>
They&#39;ve also pushed the current charter movement that, aided by misleading stats appear successful but in truth are no better and frequently worse than public schools while not sharing back a single &#34;best practice.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Then we have private companies like the College Board and Pearson both of whom have an outsized influence on US Ed policy and curriculum.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t doubt the good intentions of code.org - as I said, I&#39;m a fan. I am concerned when they and others take actions that can affect ed policy. I&#39;m concerned when code.org representative pushes students to take an AP exam - not a great CS course with a great CS teacher but the actual exam. I&#39;m even more concerned when code.org offers free PD when a school signs up for the PSAT8/9 - another high stakes meaningless test at taxpayer expense. For code.org it&#39;s a means to  get more CS ed out there. To me it&#39;s setting up a new cash cow for the college board at my expense and at students expense.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen many Ed Tech people, armed with the best intentions, enter the lions den – a school, district, or municipality only to see their best intentions corrupted in the name of cost cutting, profits, or politics.
</p>
