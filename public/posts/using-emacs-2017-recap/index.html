This past year I recorded 14 Using Emacs videos. This is on top of the
25 videos I made last year. The fall off in production is
understandable. I got through my day to day configuration in the
late 20s and since then the videos have just been on things I&#39;ve
rediscovered, things that became useful and things that I just found
interesting. It was also a busier year.
</p>
<p>
Why did I start the series? Mostly for my students. There&#39;s the built
in Emacs tutorial and other beginner resources but how do you go from
the basics to a real working configuration? For years I would show my
kids Emacs and use it in class but there was never a path for them to
follow from beginner to craftsman. I hoped the videos would fill the
void.
</p>
<p>
It probably didn&#39;t. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m getting greater Emacs adoption
from my students but on the other hand, I&#39;ve found making the series
rewarding for other reasons.
</p>
<p>
First and foremost, it&#39;s allowed me to be an active contributing
member of the Emacs community. I haven&#39;t written any Emacs packages
nor am I an active guy on any Emacs forums but this is a way I can do
my part.
</p>
<p>
Second, although there hasn&#39;t been a great deal of comments on the
videos or blog posts I&#39;ve gotten to know a few people that I wouldn&#39;t
have gotten to know otherwise.
</p>
<p>
It also shows that that if you put things out there people might find
it useful. I don&#39;t know how many people saw my Emacs posts at the
start but a year and half later I&#39;ve got 1,700 YouTube
subscribers. Sure, that&#39;s nothing compared to many YouTubers but
for a guy making schlocky videos at his desk about an as much as I hate to admit it
non-maintream editor, I think it&#39;s pretty cool.
</p>
<p>
The question is what to make videos on moving forward?
</p>
<p>
I thought I&#39;d throw it out to the community. Here&#39;s an embedded
poll. Feel free to suggest other topics either on the blog or
as a Twitter reply.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t promise I&#39;ll get to all or any but I&#39;ll certainly check out
the popular suggestions.
