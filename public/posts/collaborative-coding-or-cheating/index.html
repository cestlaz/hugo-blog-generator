I haven&#39;t been teaching this past semester. That&#39;s why I haven&#39;t been
writing much about lessons. I miss working with students but that will
resume in the fall and this semester has allowed me to get a jump on
new projects.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s also allowed me to look at some student issues from a bit of a
distance.
</p>
<p>
One issue that keeps coming up is cheating.
</p>
<p>
Some of it, classroom cheating. my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/cscheerleader">Ria</a> recently asked a
question on Facebook about it. A nice thread ensued but unfortunately,
it&#39;s locked in the Facebook silo. I&#39;ve got a lot to say on that and
hope to explore it soon but today let&#39;s focus on project
cheating - something that could just as easily apply to homeworks and
student essays and research papers as well.
</p>
<p>
One part of the question is on students using code they find out in
the wild. <a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo">Alfred</a> wrote a bit about it on his blog <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2016/05/copying-codesteal-from-best.html">here</a> where he points
out some pluses, some minuses, and raises some good thought points.
</p>
<p>
I want to keep it in the class - code sharing amongst students,
project and source code submission, and group projects.
</p>
<p>
Teachers have all sorts of options these days including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Using a CMS like Blackboard or Moodle
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Dropbox based solutions
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Emailing projects
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Using development tools and sites such as git with GitHub, BitBucket
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
or other repository hosting services
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve always been a fan of having the kids learn real software
engineering skills along with the CS so Git, GitHub and public repos
have been my weapon of choice.
</p>
<p>
Interesting enough, I&#39;ve gotten an earful both from fellow teachers
and professors and online for my stance on public repos.
</p>
<p>
I keep hearing &#34;the kids will copy from each other&#34; or something like
that.
</p>
<p>
As Alfred said in his post: &#34;Students have been copying from
classmates for years.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Students who want to copy assignments have done so long before we&#39;ve
been teaching CS and they&#39;ll be doing it for years to come.
</p>
<p>
Using a hidden submission system doesn&#39;t help and could hurt.
</p>
<p>
Far better to create an open environment. You get an opportunity to
talk about code sharing, attribution, learning from each other,
supporting each other, and where to draw the line.
</p>
<p>
On top of that, the students learn a real tool set and have a chance
to learn real development methodologies.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a win all around.
</p>
<p>
Will open repos stop cheating and irresponsible copying? Certainly
not. It could, however, raise awareness.
</p>
<p>
So what do I do on the cheating front?
</p>
<p>
Besides trying to create a culture where cheating is discouraged,
cooperation is encouraged but where students know the line, I will try
to keep them honest.
</p>
<p>
Frequently, the day a big project is due, I&#39;ll give a quiz on the
project. Students will have to describe parts of the project and what
they did. Either a student will have had to contributed or at least
will have had to have studied the rest of the teams code to pass the
quiz.
</p>
<p>
GitHub also gives tools that help.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s the GitHub graph for a project:
</p>
<img src="/img/github-graph.png" alt="/img/github-graph.png" title="/img/github-graph.png" align="center"/>
<p>
You can see who did what and when. The teacher can drill down further
to examine the diffs – what code did each student write, when, and
from where. If two students submit very similar code, the commit
timestamps will even tell you who was first.
</p>
<p>
The tooling for teachers could be better but the infrastructure is
there.
</p>
<p>
Technology isn&#39;t going to prevent cheating and more often than not, it
seems that measures taken don&#39;t stop the bad guys but inconvenience
those trying to do it right.
</p>
<p>
Much better to build a class culture where the kids want to do it the
right way.
