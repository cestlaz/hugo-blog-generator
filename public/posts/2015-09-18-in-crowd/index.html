Earlier this week, Mayor Bill deBlasio announced some ambitious
<a href="http://avc.com/2015/09/computer-science-for-all/">CS Education Plans</a> for NYC. I posted a response <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2015/09/15/failed.html#.Vfx1Rp_0-Ak">here</a>. Now that a few
days past, I thought I'd clear a few things up.
</p>

<p>
First and foremost, I hope my concerns are unfounded and I hope the
plan is a tremendous success.
</p>

<p>
What's got me bummed is not that I need to see my name in lights
given that in many ways I've been a CS Ed trailblazer (although who doesn't
like a little ego stroking), rather that in my humble opinion NY has
squandered a great opportunity and resource and as a results, kids
won't get nearly all they could.
</p>

<p>
This STEMs from the fact that NYC has been unwilling to engage us,
StuyCS as a resource. We've got the most experience and success in
building programs, training teachers, and teaching kids. What more
could you ask?
</p>

<p>
I've repeatedly reached out to and repeatedly invited in key
government and DOE players in an effort to try to get them to look at
our work and leverage it to do more good for more kids but over two
mayors and around fifteen years, the silence we get back is deafening.
</p>

<p>
Now, this isn't to say that I don't have some friends and supporters
in the CS Ed space. I consider <a href="http://avc.com/2015/09/computer-science-for-all/">Fred Wilson</a>, the main man driving this
from the tech sector side to be a supporter, ally and friend. His
involvement is the key reason I think this whole thing might
work. Likewise, many people in the tech industry who've worked with my
graduates are very supportive of my efforts and my actual graduates are
a wonderfully supportive family.
</p>

<p>
So why do the DOE and NYC people say they don't want to include us?
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the things I get back:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We want something that works for all students.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This implies that our stuff is purely a result of Stuy being a school
with high achievers. My response?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>By saying all students but excluding high achievers, you can't mean
all students.
</li>
<li>Other high achieving schools haven't developed anything near what
we've built.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
and it also ignores the fact that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Our nonprofit has had kids from around 40 to 50 schools and we
get rave reviews from those kids and their parents.
</li>
<li>Our gender numbers far outpace the national averages.
</li>
<li>We've had teachers move on to other schools and customize our work
their.
</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
and this is just the teaching part. What about our success in
designing an overall program or training teachers.
</p>

<p>
Of course it doesn't help that Stuyvesant's own administration has
never recognized nor supported StuyCS.
</p>

<p>
You'd think that those with the keys to the castle would engage and at
least consult with the people who've been doing this successfully for
over 20 years.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
So who are these folk with the keys?
</p>

<p>
It's a mix of people. Some in NYC government, some in DOE, some Tech
entrepreneurs, and running program. None have our experience or track
record and a number have neither taught nor coded.
</p>

<p>
Why won't they really engage us?
</p>

<p>
You're guess is as good as mine but I have my suspicions.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4"></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Why am I concerned?
</p>

<p>
Because we have something to offer. NYC and DOE won't leverage us as a
resource. What other missteps will they make as they try to bring
CS4All.
</p>

<p>
I have no control over all of this, all I can do is work in my little
corner of the world. If others want my help, my doors always open. If
not, I know there will always be some parents, kids, and educators who
get what we do and will benefit from it.
