Today was the last day of classes at Hunter thus ending my first
semester of teaching at Hunter College.
</p>
<p>
I very much enjoyed the semester and my class and look forward to
working with the same group when the spring term starts in a few
weeks.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, even though I&#39;m a quarter century veteran teacher,
in many ways this was like my rookie season all over again.
</p>
<p>
My class was an honors intro class so the material wasn&#39;t new to me
but there were a number of adjustments going from high school to college.
</p>
<p>
I taught a few college classes as an adjunct back in the nineties but
I was a young teacher at the time and that was a lifetime ago.
</p>
<p>
The biggest difference is that we only met two days a week. Monday and
Thursday and we met for 1:45 rather than 45 minutes. The longer class
is nice but the twice a week means that you don&#39;t get that every day
reinforcement you have in high school.
</p>
<p>
It also means that there were times when we would go a week between
classes due to a single day off.
</p>
<p>
The biggest challenge, one that I&#39;m continuing to work on, is figuring
out how much we can do in a class, what and how much to assign between
classes and what&#39;s the best way to motivate the student&#39;s to space out
the work while doing something every day.
</p>
<p>
That wasn&#39;t much of a challenge at Stuy. Having been there so long, I
had a good feel for my students as well as the pace and rhythm of
Stuy. Hunter has it&#39;s own rhythm and pace and I&#39;m still figuring it
out.
</p>
<p>
We also had to pivot early on as the student laptops didn&#39;t arrive
until a third of the semester was over.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, much of my work these days has to do with
developing the overall honors program as well as Hunter&#39;s forthcoming
teacher education programs in CS so I&#39;m only teaching a single class
right now and it&#39;s small.
</p>
<p>
If there are any rookie teachers reading this, congratulations on
getting through your first semester. I know you guys go a little bit
longer, but you&#39;re in the home stretch.
</p>
<p>
Teaching right, particularly in public schools with large classes  will
always be an all in activity - certainly harder and more draining than
anything I ever did in industry but it does get easier as you learn
your school and students and develop your craft.
