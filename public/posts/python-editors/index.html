Earlier today I read Garth Flint&#39;s latest post on <a href="https://gflint.wordpress.com/2017/05/25/python-editors-simple-wins/%0A">choosing a Python
environment for his classes</a>. While our classes and populations are
different it looks like Garth and I share a lot of thoughts on the
subject.
</p>
<p>
I started to write a comment to leave on Garth&#39;s blog but since it was
getting a little long I thought I&#39;d write it up as a post.
</p>
<p>
The question of development environment can be an important one and
can make a big difference. When I designed the intro course at Stuy,
the fact that Dr. Scheme existed made the use of Scheme in the class
an option. Without it as a supportive and simple environment for the
students I probably wouldn&#39;t have been able to use Scheme even though
I really liked it as a teaching and learning tool.
</p>
<p>
Garth writes about issues relating to choosing a local development
environment so that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to stick to here. If you want an
online environment check out <a href="http://codesters.com">Codesters</a> - a terrific online Python
environment with lots of educational support materials and features
and <a href="http://repl.it">repl.it</a> - an online environment that supports many languages and
is also developing great teacher and class support – I very much like
both of these platforms.
</p>
<p>
The first question is editor or IDE?
</p>
<p>
As a user, I&#39;m very pro editor. Learn a tool that you can customize to
your tastes and that will work for all sorts of text editing chores
from coding to document preparation to scheduling and more and you&#39;re
in great shape. Personally, I&#39;m an <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs">Emacs wonk</a> but there are other
choices as well.
</p>
<p>
As a teacher, though, Emacs or another programmers editor can be
overwhelming for younger students and rank beginners.
</p>
<p>
This can make IDEs attractive.
</p>
<p>
Some IDEs are too big and cumbersome and can add even more cognitive
load than an editor - think Eclipse for Java development. If you think
writing
</p>
<div class="src src-java">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
is a lot of overhead, just wait until you have a novice try to start a
Java project in Eclipse.
</p>
<p>
Other IDEs are more streamlined. One common choice is
Idle. It&#39;s big advantage is that it&#39;s always available and is &#34;part&#34;
of Python. On the other hand, it doesn&#39;t seem to add much to a bare
editor and I&#39;ve found that it can be somewhat confusing.
</p>
<p>
Garth seems to have settled on <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> from <a href="https://jetbrains.com">JetBrains</a>. It&#39;s pretty
streamlined and really easy to get up and running. JetBrains also
provides a free community edition as well as a heavier professional
one available for purchase. Garth notes that it&#39;s a Python only IDE
but JetBrains has similar IDEs for a whole bunch of languages and I
seem to recall you can add plugins across their IDEs to basically make
them multi-language development environments.
</p>
<p>
I really like the JetBrains products and if I used an IDE I&#39;m pretty
sure I&#39;d use their products. As a teacher though, I find their IDEs a
little too powerful for my tastes. I want a learner IDE to provide the
bare minimum of features - an interactive REPL, a code window, run and
debug buttons, some completion and help - but to make those features
really easy to use. JetBrains does a little too much.
</p>
<p>
What I ended up using in the past is <a href="http://drpython.sourceforge.net/">Dr Python</a>. For me it hit the
sweet spot. As an added bonus we were already using Dr. Racket (nee
Dr. Scheme) and Dr. Java so our students had a similar environment
across languages and even NetLogo looked and behaved similarly.
</p>
<p>
Is there a right answer? Probably not. Just as with choosing a first
language there are always trade offs. Besides, if you don&#39;t have the
right solution, there will be another one next week. Just recently I
saw <a href="http://thonny.org/">this project</a>. A new beginners IDE for python. It looks interesting
and worth checking out.
</p>
<p>
The right IDE can make a big difference while keeping the overhead low
and giving just the right amount of support. For me, the last time
around it was Dr. Python. For Garth, it looks like PyCharm fits the
bill. Looking at the overall plan, I usually start the kids off with a
simple learners IDE and then transition them to a programmers editor
like Emacs as they gain more comfort and experience.
</p>
<p>
As a postscript, let me share these links on how I use Emacs for
Python development (each with a video) as well as my series on how I
use Emacs in general:
