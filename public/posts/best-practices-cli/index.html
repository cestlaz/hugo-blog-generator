I&#39;ve been trying to be an active participant on the <a href="https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/">CS Educators
StackExchange</a>. You should try to as well!!!
</p>
<p>
I answered a question about using the command line which led to a back
and forth. I gave an example of something I might do in class to
illustrate the power of using the command line and linked to some of
my past <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/categories/cli/">posts</a>. There was some back and forth in the comments - some of
the participants weren&#39;t happy with my code as they felt it was filled
with poor coding practices.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not going to comment on the discussion other than to say that I
make no apologies for how I use the Linux tools and the command line
as my methods have served me well over the years. I also make no
apologies on how I teach my students as I seem to have by and large
done right by them over the years as well.
</p>
<p>
The crux was that I was showing what I might type in a class without
any of the class commentary. It wasn&#39;t meant to be a script in a file
let alone reusable code or a full blown program.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t want to spend time here talking about &#34;best practices&#34; for
shell scripting. There are plenty of <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/03/26/bash-quirks/">resources</a> a search engine away.
</p>
<p>
The question is that how universal are best practices and is it more
important that we teach specific best practices or rather that we have
a discussion with our students about best practices.
</p>
<p>
Some general best practices are probably pretty universal – &#34;write
clear code&#34; but I&#39;ve seen best practices that when followed
religiously just don&#39;t always make sense:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
never break out of a loop
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
one return statement per function
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
always or never do anything in particular
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
all code should be commented
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
always use an ORM
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
to list a few.
</p>
<p>
So, best practices aren&#39;t always best. More like guidelines to think
about when you&#39;re programming and then you and your team can make
smart decisions.
</p>
<p>
So, when I wrote those lines over on StackExchange, was I really
showing my students how to code badly? The code:
</p>
<div class="src src-bash">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">ls *gif | <span style="color:#66d9ef">while</span> read i
<span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span>
f<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>basename $i .gif<span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>
convert $i -resize 200x200 smaller-$f.gif
<span style="color:#66d9ef">done</span></code></pre></div></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
doesn&#39;t exist in a vacuum. We start with an ls to see the directory,
we use the <strong><strong>echo</strong></strong> throughout to test things before we run it live
and then we run it live in such a way that it can&#39;t be
destructive. I&#39;ve been using the command line this way for decades and
while I&#39;ve screwed plenty of things up, it&#39;s never been due to a bad
command line shell practice.
</p>
<p>
The important part is the discussion with the class:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
would this be appropriate in a script file?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
what are the dangers
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
why and when is it ok?
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
etc.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not our job to dictate to our students which best practices to
follow but rather to prepare them to make smart decisions.
</p>
<p>
This year, I&#39;m back to using C++ in class after maybe two decades. I&#39;m
not up on current C++ best practices. I was wondering what was best:
</p>
<div class="src src-c++">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c++" data-lang="c++">
</code></pre></div>
</div>
<div class="src src-c++">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c++" data-lang="c++">
</code></pre></div>
</div>
<div class="src src-c++">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c++" data-lang="c++">
</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
or even if we should use &#34;\n&#34; vs endl.
</p>
<p>
I did my research, presented the results to my students and we talked
about what they should consider when making their decision.
</p>
<p>
Students don&#39;t need us to blindly
spout best practices. They can read them online or in a book. They do
need us to guide them towards critically thinking about them.
