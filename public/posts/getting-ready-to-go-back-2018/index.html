It&#39;s August 3rd and I&#39;ve been giving a lot of thought to the start of
the semester. Normally I wouldn&#39;t think about the Fall term this
early. While I&#39;ve been working on and off since last semester ended, I
don&#39;t officially &#34;go back&#34; until August 23rd with classes starting on
the 27th. The difference is that for the first time in forever we&#39;re
taking a longish trip between now and then.
</p>
<p>
We&#39;re heading over to Harrogate England. We&#39;ve never been but Natan&#39;s
taking part in the <a href="http://www.gsfestivals.org/">International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival</a> so we
figured we&#39;d follow and play tourist while he was rehearsing and
otherwise doing the festival. I&#39;m looking forward to the trip but
don&#39;t expect to get much prep work done while we&#39;re there.
</p>
<p>
So, what&#39;s coming this semester?
</p>
<h2 id="headline-1">
Classes
</h2>
<p>
Hunter&#39;s honors program has grown big time so I&#39;ll be teaching two
classes instead of one this semester. One section will be our
pre-major CS course and one will be our CS1. I&#39;ve done both before so
I won&#39;t need a lot of advance prep. Besides, I learned long ago that
no matter how much prep you do, everything changes once you get in the
classroom with a new batch of kids. Better just to have starter
material and a direction since everything&#39;s going to change after day
one anyway.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-2">
Teacher Ed stuff
</h2>
<p>
On the teacher education program front, we&#39;ve got to send a few items
back through governance for approval. Instead of having teachers in my
programs take a separate fieldwork course, I integrated it into my
curriculum development course. Another change that we have to make,
believe it or not, is to remove the words &#34;for teachers&#34; and &#34;for
educators&#34; from two of the pure computer science courses in the
program. Fortunately, I&#39;ve done all the prep work needed to get these
going come late August. We&#39;re still planning on starting our first
cohort in the Spring.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-3">
Other stuff
</h2>
<p>
Here&#39;s where a lot of the fun stuff is happening. Like last year, I&#39;m
planning on doing a lot of outreach to high schools to talk about
colleges, tech, and Hunter. The outreach&#39;s <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hunter-cs-year-two/">really made a difference</a>
but it take a lot of time since it&#39;s all about school visits. I&#39;m
hoping to get to some parents association meetings as well this year.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also planning a number of new things for our Hunter CS students
and I&#39;d love to jump on the planning now but these things really have
to wait until the term starts. Here&#39;s some of what&#39;s on tap:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
A monthly CTLE session for CS teachers.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A monthly tech talk / meetup at Hunter for CS students.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Finding more and more internship opportunities for the kids.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A series of open source workshops I&#39;m coordinating with MongoDB.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I&#39;m hoping to work out some workshops for the kids with [[<a href="https://www.redballoonsecurity.com/][Red">https://www.redballoonsecurity.com/][Red</a> Balloon
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Security]]
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
And a new tech mentoring program I&#39;m hoping to get off the ground.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I&#39;m sure some of these plans will change. I think I&#39;m pretty ready to
go for the fall but I&#39;ll still mull things over for the next few
weeks.
