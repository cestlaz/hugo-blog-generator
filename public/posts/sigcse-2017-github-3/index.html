I wanted to write this up earlier but, as so frequently happens all my
dormant work projects decided it was time to rise up and demand
instant attention.
</p>
<p>
When we left off, we had students pulling code and submitting homework
via github.
</p>
<p>
Form here, it&#39;s an easy step to have them working on a small project
in their own repo. In fact, sometimes, I&#39;ll jump right to a two person
project where one person creates the repo and invites the other (and
me) as a collaborator.
</p>
<p>
Once here, it&#39;s important to emphasize the normal workflow:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<code>git pull</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
edit stuff with an occasional <code>git add</code>, <code>git rm</code>,  or <code>got mv</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
commit
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
and an occasional <code>git push</code>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Regardless of how much you emphasize the workflow you&#39;re now going to
have to cover merges as well how to recover from problems by going to
an earlier revision.
</p>
<p>
For going back to earlier versions or otherwise recovering from
disasters, I don&#39;t show them the &#34;right&#34; way of doing things. I show
them a way that&#39;s easy to remember and reliably works without tons of
searching for answers.
</p>
<p>
First, given some repo, I have them clone a version under another
name:
</p>
<div class="src src-sh">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">git clone git@github.com:hunterdaedalus/classcode.git newdirname</code></pre></div></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Now, they have the original repo and a clone under the directory
<strong><strong>newdirname</strong></strong>.
</p>
<p>
I have them go into that new copy and use <code>git log</code> to go through the
logs to find an earlier version that they want to go back to.
</p>
<p>
The log will look something like this:

commit 6d5bcf866306334ddc5c6a48e8f49fb39ddbcb18
Author: Some other coder &lt;somone@somewhere.net&gt;

</p>
</div>
<p>
Find the hash that they want to get back to and <strong><strong>checkout</strong></strong> that
version (you normally only have to use the first few characters of
the hash):
</p>
<div class="src src-sh">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">git checkout 7efed10</code></pre></div></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Now they can grab what they want, copy it into the working copy of the
repo, <strong><strong>commit</strong></strong> the changes and <strong><strong>push</strong></strong> them back.
</p>
<p>
For Merging, I start by having them do it manually. I&#39;ll have them
load the file in question into their editor and look for the chunks
that look like this:
</p>
<div class="verse-block">
<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; A
lines in file A
<code class="verbatim">=====</code>
lines in file B
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; B
</p>
</div>
<p>
They&#39;ll manually make the changes, then save, commit and push back.
</p>
<p>
Later, I&#39;ll show them a couple of tools to help along the way. I
usually show ediff in emacs along with meld.
</p>
<p>
Once they&#39;ve been doing this for a while, it&#39;s easy to expand group
sizes. After that, I&#39;ll introduce <strong><strong>issues</strong></strong> via the github interface.
</p>
<p>
The last big topic is branches.
</p>
<p>
First I show basic branches and merging. Here&#39;s a pretty good <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging">run
through</a>. Afterwards, I&#39;ll show how branching works in conjunction with
github. This is also a good time to emphasize that students have to
actually read the messages that git gives them when things don&#39;t  go
well. In most cases, the message will contain the exact thing to type
to fix the problem (such as linking a branch with a branch up on
github).
</p>
<p>
Now is also the time to introduce pull requests and how to use them to
support code review. The general setup I recommend is one branch per
group member and a main &#34;deployment&#34; branch with group members
creating more branches as they see fit.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s about it. I&#39;ve followed this process, more or less, over a
semester, over a year, and over multiple years. It&#39;s worked for me, I
hope some of this helps you as well.
</p>
<p>
In the next and probably last git/github post I&#39;ll talk about the
educational benefits that I&#39;ve discovered along the way. After that,
I&#39;ll get back to some emacs videos, other SIGCSE stuff and my normal rants.
