<p>The buzz word is &ldquo;accountability.&rdquo; Why are teachers special? Why don&rsquo;t
they feel they need to be evaluated like other professionals? Why do
they feel they need a &ldquo;job for life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, the job for life line is nonsense &ndash; teachers have tenure,
but that&rsquo;s just due process - not a guarantee of a job.</p>
<p>Friends in the private sector ask &ldquo;if a teacher is doing a good job,
why do they need tenure? In the private sector as long as you&rsquo;re
producing, you&rsquo;ve got nothing to worry about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, first I dispute that last sentence. second, K-12 education isn&rsquo;t
the real world. It&rsquo;s rife with stories of administrators that go after
teachers for no apparent reason. Why? Because accountability doesn&rsquo;t
mean accountability - it means we can fire teachers at will. No one
wants accountability to apply to anyone except the ground troops. I
don&rsquo;t have an exact attribution, but Mayor Bloomberg is frequently
quoted as stating &ldquo;If parent&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t like the way I run the schools,
they can boo me at parades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beyond that, the powers that be state that teacher accountability
revolves around flawed &ldquo;value added&rdquo; metrics but other bloggers such as Gary
Rubintein have already done a great job debunking that.</p>
<h1 id="the-solution">The Solution:</h1>
<p>The solution is to simplify. There&rsquo;s a better way. Let&rsquo;s start by
making the principals accountable. Bottom line is that they&rsquo;re
responsible for a school&rsquo;s success. If the school doesn&rsquo;t cut the
mustard, then they&rsquo;re out. But, how do we measure this?</p>
