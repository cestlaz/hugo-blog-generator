Scheme is one of the languages used in Stuy&#39;s intro CS course. Like
any other language, there are pros and cons of using it to introduce
students to CS. Here are some of the reasons why I like Scheme as a
first language and why despite that,  I don&#39;t recommend it in many
cases.
</p>
<p>
Scheme certainly isn&#39;t mainstream. That&#39;s not the main reason why I
like it but it is a side benefit. It&#39;s less likely kids come into
class knowing it which creates a level playing field. The few times
I&#39;ve had a student with a background in Scheme, they&#39;ve been good,
helpful kids rather than ones that tried to show off and dominate the
class.
</p>
<p>
I like scheme because it&#39;s simple. It looks different than other
languages but is <code>(+ 3 4)</code> really that different than <code>add(3,4)</code> or
<code>3+4</code>?
</p>
<p>
We can tell kids &#34;everything&#39;s a function.&#34; While technically not
true, and I tell my students that it isn&#39;t, it&#39;s close enough for our
purposes. Everything&#39;s a function and the way we write a function is:
</p>
<div class="src src-scheme">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-scheme" data-lang="scheme"><div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-scheme" data-lang="scheme">(<span style="color:#a6e22e">f</span> a b <span style="color:#f92672">...</span>)</code></pre></div></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Apply function <strong><strong>f</strong></strong> on arguments <strong><strong>b c …</strong></strong>. So we have <code>(+ 2 3)</code> to
add 2 and 3, <code>(and a b)</code> for logical and <code>(= 3 4)</code> to test to see if 3
is equal to 4, etc. We also have the same basic notation for things
like conditionals. In java, we might write:
</p>
<div class="src src-java">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
In scheme, it would be:
</p>
<div class="src src-scheme">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-scheme" data-lang="scheme"><div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-scheme" data-lang="scheme">(<span style="color:#66d9ef">if </span>(&gt; a <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>)
<span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
<span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>)</code></pre></div></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Even though we&#39;re fudging the rules, we can lay out a handful of rules
for the kids such as lambda and define follow a similar form to create and
name functions:
</p>
<div class="src src-scheme">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-scheme" data-lang="scheme"><div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-scheme" data-lang="scheme">(<span style="color:#66d9ef">define </span>add2 (<span style="color:#66d9ef">lambda </span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">a</span> b) (+ a b)))</code></pre></div></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
where <code>(lambda (a b) (+ a b))</code> returns a function that adds <strong><strong>a</strong></strong> and
<strong><strong>b</strong></strong> and <code>define</code> associates it with the identifier <strong><strong>add2</strong></strong>. Now we
can use the function: <code>(add2 5 10)</code> which evaluates to 15.
</p>
<p>
With lambda, define, if, and a few more basics, it&#39;s off to the
races. The simple, consistent syntax makes things easy for the kids
and the constrained tool set lets us focus their way of thinking.
</p>
<p>
Of course this wouldn&#39;t work had DrScheme (now <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>) not
existed. That gave us a nice learning IDE to work in.
</p>
<p>
Using Scheme, we can not only cover the basics like conditionals,
abstraction and such but also deeper concepts like recursion, map,
filter, and reduce. When we move on from Scheme, the kids also have a
frame of reference for all the other languages and paradigms they use.
</p>
<p>
There are downsides, however. Outside help is harder to come by and
there is some pushback from parents and it isn&#39;t as pretty and flashy
as some other tool-sets. Scheme worked at Stuy for a number of
reasons. When I created the class that used it, there were no good
pre-AP classes in the school and I had a pretty good reputation as a
teacher. The class also used multiple tools with <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a> being the
primary other one and tackled a variety of CS and non CS topics.
First time through, reputation and buzz filled the classes and after
that, the class developed a solid enough reputation to fill itself.
</p>
<p>
It also didn&#39;t hurt that our program developed from the inside
out. First, we had APCS-AB on the books as a junior year course, then
I added our post AP senior year electives. Since it was easy to show
what the kids were already graduating with, it was easy to diffuse any
pushback from not using mainstream tools in the first class.
</p>
<p>
Scheme worked at Stuy and I feel that it still does. Would I use
Scheme for a first experience in a drop in program at an after-school
where kids might not come back if they don&#39;t get to a payoff
immediately? Probably not. Would I recommend it at a school where I
want to integrate CS with some of the other subjects quickly, again,
probably not (except for integration with algebra where <a href="http://www.bootstrapworld.org/">Bootstrapworld</a>
is a terrific program).
</p>
<p>
In any event, if you&#39;re a high school CS teacher and  haven&#39;t played
with scheme  or some other functional language, I highly recommend
it - you might not actually ever teach it or use it but it can really
help develop you as a programmer and an educator.
