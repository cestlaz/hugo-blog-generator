<p>Last time, I shared my thoughts on the recent coverage of AP CS statistics. Compiled and presented by <a href="http://home.cc.gatech.edu/ice-gt/556">Barbara Ericson</a>
and later reported on all over the place.</p>
<p>To summarize my point of view - yes there is a problem but some of the
highlighted data points can easily be shown to be irrelevant and
therefore can hurt the greater goal of access to great CS education for
all.</p>
<p>This felt like the launching pad for a great class discussion.</p>
<p>I presented this to my classes last week:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>and asked &ldquo;what do you make of this?&rdquo; I was curious what the classes
would say - they know I&rsquo;m concerned with gender equity and know that
at Stuy we&rsquo;ve done better than most.</p>
<p>I can say that I was very happy with their answers.</p>
<p>We got things like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How many took the test?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What states? How many African-Americans in &hellip;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>can we see the numbers?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, we started talking about the actual numbers. It&rsquo;s amazing when you
actually look at the facts, truths come out.</p>
<p>I was extremely pleased that my students saw right past the spin and
searched for the actual numbers.</p>
<p>In my last post I explained why the stated claims - no girls in three
states, no blacks / Hispanics on 11 were horrible examples. Why focus
on these when it&rsquo;s so easy to find better examples:</p>
<p>The overall 20% female test takers is an easy stat to point to, but
why point out Alaska&rsquo;s lack of African-American test takers when it&rsquo;s
statistically irrelevant. Why not point out that in NY, only 68
African-American test takers and 150 Hispanic (out of 1858 test).
Given that NY is about 16% black ad 17% Hispanic, we would have
expected around 300 from each group.</p>
<p>In any event, I&rsquo;m delighted that my students are perceptive enough to
see past headlines, dig down to data, and make their own conclusions.</p>
