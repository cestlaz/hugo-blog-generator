Stan, of course, is one of the most talented people I know.
</p>
<p>
It reminded me of a conversation I had with my colleague and friend
Jim last year. I had just recieved an email from a former student
turned friend. We were trying to find some time to catch up.  I told
Jim I had just heard from this young lady and Jim replied &#34;I remember
her, she&#39;s awesome. Really smart.&#34; I mention this because the
individual we were talking about, while to us, extremely talented in
addition to being just a terrific person spent much of her career
living in self doubt.
</p>
<p>
Meantime, I was having a conversation with another friend and the
topic turned to impostor syndrome and the desire to make it a thing of
the past.
</p>
<p>
Problem is, I don&#39;t know if that will ever be the case. I&#39;m
approaching 50 and have a career of good work behind me but I still
find myself questioning my credentials, work, and ability. Then I realized I wasn&#39;t alone
when I read <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertTalbert">Robert Talbert&#39;s</a> recent <a href="http://rtalbert.org/blog/2016/tenure-second-time">blog post</a> about his going through
the tenure process for a second time and &#34;learning through this process
that I have not outrun impostor syndrome and probably never will.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Stan&#39;s tweets tell part of the story. When we surround ourselves with
smart, accomplished people, we sometimes feel we don&#39;t measure
up. I&#39;ve found that for the most part, the extremely accomplished
people I&#39;ve worked with are very unassuming and low key. They seem to
operate assuming that  everyone else is at least as capable and quick as
they. I recall <a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html">Paul Graham</a> talking about this in an essay but
I don&#39;t remember which one. The problem is, if you don&#39;t understand
their sincerity, you end up feeling even more inadequate.
</p>
<p>
It gets worse when we start comparing ourselves to some unreal
composite. I remember feeling pretty stupid back when I was younger
comparing myself with others. The problem was that I clearly didn&#39;t
measure up to the best math kid, or the best computer kid, the best
fencer, the best violinist, etc. Now, the best math kid might have
been a lousy athlete and the best fencer, a so so mathematician, but
to me, I was comparing myself with this composite super human. No
wonder I never measured up. Eventually, though, I realized three
things. First, there&#39;s always someone better at something and always
someone worse. Second, that&#39;s not the true value of ones worth as a
person, and three, I bring some good stuff to the table and I should
be (and am) content with that
</p>
<p>
So, I still struggle with impostor syndrome but at the end of the day,
it just serves as a reminder to look back on what I&#39;ve done and what
I&#39;ve learned in the process.  I start out in question but in the end,
leave confident. Maybe the trick isn&#39;t to eliminate impostor syndrome
but rather to understand and contain it. We don&#39;t want to live in fear
and anxiety but both are useful emotions when we control them and not
the reverse.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s probably good when we question ourselves and re-evaluate our
positions - we just have to make sure as we&#39;re bringing new people
into the tech fold that we foster acceptance and confidence  and when
impostor syndrome sets in that it can be channeled into a positive
and not scare people away.
