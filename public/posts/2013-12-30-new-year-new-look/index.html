Why the rewrite? Partly because I was tired of the look, but mostly because, when I put it together, it was the first time I used that toolset and was just figuring things out.

            <p>We&rsquo;re practically at the close of 2013 and it&rsquo;s high time I wished
everyone wonderful things for the year to come.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also time for a new look to this blog.</p>
<p>Why the rewrite? Partly because I was tired of the look, but mostly
because, when I put it together, it was the first time I used that
toolset and was just figuring things out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still no expert, but I thought it was time to clean things up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> generated blog hosted on
<a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> but instead of using
<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> I decided to use
<a href="http://weice.in/ivory/">Ivory</a>. It&rsquo;s much smaller and only does the
basics. Even the menu I&rsquo;m using was the result of some online
searching for CSS stuff. I figure that this way, I&rsquo;ll actually learn
more about styling.</p>
<p>This should be an interesting year. I&rsquo;ve got a number of projects that
I&rsquo;m working on. Some within Stuyvesant, some revolving around <a href="https://cstuy.org">CSTUY</a>, and some I can&rsquo;t talk about right now. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll
be able to write about some of them in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also hoping to write more this year. I only posted 30 times this
past year. On the other hand, that&rsquo;s up from 18 times in 2012 and only
4 posts in 2011.</p>
<p>In addition to updates on CSTUY, pedagogical posts and the occasional
rant, I&rsquo;d like to do a series on how I use tools like the Linux shell
and Emacs.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see how things go.</p>
<p>For now, I wish you all a happy and healthy new year.</p>
