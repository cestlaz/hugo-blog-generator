Yesterday I was one of the judges at <a href="http://stuyhacks.com/">StuyHacks</a>. A one day hackathon at
Stuyvesant run by and organized by the students. I don&#39;t have attendee
stats but there were kids from all over the city and at least one team
from New Jersey. The youngest student that I met was in sixth grade
and the oldest were high school seniors. The judging was at the end
but I decided to stop by earlier to see how the hackers were doing.

<p>
There was an incredible variety of projects using a wide array of
tools. There were projects built with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Java
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Processing
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
C#
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Scratch
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A-Frame
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Python / Flask
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
HTML/CSS/JS
</p>
</li>

<p>
and more

</ul>
<p>
A personal highlight for me was running into Sophie - the daughter of
two of my students from #Stuy95. Well, both a highlight and a reminder
that I&#39;m getting old.
</p>
<p>
The StuyHacks team did a terrific job running things and at the end I
told them I&#39;d love to help with future events.
</p>
<p>
I did notice a couple of things at the hackathon that echo things I&#39;ve
learned as a teacher over the years and I thought they were worth
sharing.
</p>
<p>
The first was the a number of the beginner groups needed more
direction. This didn&#39;t seem to be related to grade level or age as
much as CS experience. This isn&#39;t a hackathon only issue. It exists in
all learning environments. If as teachers we&#39;re too prescriptive
students end up with a single formula to follow. Sure, that&#39;ll get
them through a standardized exam like APCS-A but too much of it can
hinder them in becoming creative problem solvers.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, not enough structure will leave many kids staring
at a blank page. I remember I gave a quiz years ago. It had one
problem: &#34;You have 20 minutes to prove to me that you learned
something about the past unit on Cellular Autmata&#34; or something like
that. Some kids absolutely loved it but many hated it. Stuy kids are
trained test takers. They&#39;re prepared for structure. This threw many
for a loop.
</p>
<p>
I noticed this issue with some of the hackers at StuyHacks. Some
beginners really had a hard time figuring out what they could do and
what they should do.
</p>
<p>
A hackathon isn&#39;t a classroom so I think the problem is pretty easily
remedied. Groups that were able to latch on to a good mentor seemed to
get the guidance they needed. A beginners hackathon should make sure
they have not only plenty of mentors but they should make sure that
the mentors are prepped with a number of project ideas in a number of
the standard beginner platforms. A hackathon could also provide an
assortment of ideas in a list.
</p>
<p>
The second thing I noticed was at the end of the day as I was
judging. It started with one particular group. They were pretty
apologetic about their project. Basically because it wasn&#39;t
finished. Personally, I thought what they accomplished in essentially
7 hours was pretty impressive. What became clear as we talked is that
this group was deathly afraid of failure. Their deepest fear at that
moment was that I was going to give them high marks and they might
have to show off their incomplete (yet rather impressive) project to a
room full of strangers.
</p>
<p>
This fear of failure was prevalent in groups that ultimately didn&#39;t
submit their projects for judging and it seemed to be common among
students from high performing, high expectation schools where
frequently one associates a test score or grade with ones value. I&#39;m
not happy to say that Stuy has always had this problem.
</p>
<p>
This isn&#39;t really a problem that a hackathon can or should be able to
address. It&#39;s just something I noticed. It&#39;s a problem for schools and
also for a society that&#39;s test obsessed.
</p>
<p>
I hope nobody reads too much into these observations. The day was a
tremendous success. A whole bunch of kids had a great day working
together to build cool things with technology. Congratulations to the
StuyHacks team. They did a terrific job putting it all together. If
you&#39;re a middle or high school student or know one, keep an eye on the
StuyHacks <a href="http://stuyhacks.com/">web page</a> and make sure to attend their next event.
