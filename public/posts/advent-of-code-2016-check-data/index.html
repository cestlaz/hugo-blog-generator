I&#39;m spending the weekend up in Michigan. Visiting my brother and is
family. We&#39;re here to see the <a href="http://umgass.org">UMGASS</a> production of Gilbert and
Sullivan&#39;s <a href="http://www.umgass.org/current-production">The Sorcerer</a>. Batya also came up from Cornell to join us so
the two families are all togehter for the first time in about 10
years.
</p>
<p>
This hasn&#39;t left much time for <a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> but I did manage to
finish yesterday&#39;s challenge this morning.
</p>
<p>
What took me so long? Much like last year, it was <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-12-17-im-an-idiot.html/">because I&#39;m an
idiot</a>.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/9">problem</a> seemed pretty straighforward. I coded a solution and it
worked for all the test cases. I tried it on my data set but
the grader said the answer was wrong. I went through the problem a
number of times as well sa my code. I figured I either mis-interpreted
the question or had some bug. I found neither to be true.
</p>
<p>
After some frustration, I went over to the Advent of Code <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/">subreddit</a>
grabbed a couple of posted solutions (trying not to look at them) and
ran both on my data - those solutions got the same answer on my data
set as I did.
</p>
<p>
This morning, I asked Batya to look over my code and the problem (it&#39;s
always good to have a daughter that&#39;s smarted than you are) but she
saw no problems.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I emailed my buddy JonAlf since I know he completed the problem. He sent back his answer along
with his data set and I got the same answer as he did on his data.
</p>
<p>
What could be the problem.
</p>
<p>
His data set was about 12k characters long, mine was 4k. Something had
to be wrong here. I went back to the Advent of Code site and grabbed
the data set again. This time, I went to the page and did a &#34;save-as&#34;
to save it - last time, I cut and pasted.
</p>
<p>
The cut and paste version was 4k, the save-as was 12k. This time it
worked and was accepted and I also finished part 2 in short order.
</p>
<p>
The moral of the story – make sure you check the integrity of your
data set - you&#39;ll never get the right answer if you&#39;re working with
the wrong data.
