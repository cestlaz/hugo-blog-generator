Every morning one of the first things I do is quickly glance at my
emails and other notifications. I really should wait until I&#39;m more
awake but old habits die hard.
</p>
<p>
As some of you know over the past couple of years I&#39;ve been making a
series of <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs">videos</a> and related post on using my editor of choice,
Emacs. I&#39;ve done 48 videos, have over 2500 subscribers on
YouTube and people seem to find some value from the series.
</p>
<p>
This morning one of my emails was a new comment on one of my videos:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Thanks for not describing a single key combination and how that fits
into basic usage of org mode.  I was going to subscribe but if all
your videos are going to be about showing off how fast you are at
typing emacs commands on your annoyingly noisy keyborad, then no
thanks!﻿
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
My first reaction was &#34;you know, you could have said something like
&#39;if you slow down an actually say the keys it would be much easier to
follow and would be more valuable&#39; and it would be much better received&#34; but
then I started to think about instructional videos in general. I
started to make these videos for my students. I thought they might be
helpful and then found that the Emacs community by and large liked
them. They&#39;re not teaching anything deep or complicated just how I use
a programmable editor. Even so, I was reminded by this comment about
the limitations of videos and ed tech in general.
</p>
<p>
Videos provide some nice features - you can watch them at any time,
you can pause and replay, and in some cases you can watch at super
speeds. What you can&#39;t do is slow the video down and most importantly
you can&#39;t ask questions or interact with the instructor. You can leave
comments if the video is on a platform like YouTube but that&#39;s pretty
limited.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, if this was a class, we would have been able to
interact and I as the instructor would have had a much better chance
to make sure this &#34;student&#34; was up to speed.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this wasn&#39;t a class. I don&#39;t have the time to teach tools
like Emacs in class and since it is a mechanical skill, it can be
offloaded to a video. The video has the ancillary benefit of living on
and being discoverable and viewable by the public at large. This is a
good thing. Videos are tech and tech scales. Unfortunately, good
education doesn&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
Videos are tech and tech is the rage. Lots of people are working hard
to get more tech in front of our kids - usually at the expense of
having a great teacher. This is something we don&#39;t need. Technology is
nice but I&#39;d rather have my kids in a small class with a knowledgable
teacher and a piece of chalk than all the tech in the world.
</p>
<p>
As a computer science guy and a computer science teacher I think it&#39;s
good to remind myself that tech is cool but a good teacher is way cooler.
