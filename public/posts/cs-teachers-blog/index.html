At this past year&#39;s CSTA conference, a few of us huddled in a corner
voiced a very common lament - &#34;it would be great if more CS teachers
blogged.&#34; It really would be. We&#39;re still a relatively small
community and while there&#39;s some good conversation going on on
mailing lists and on Facebook, those aren&#39;t easily discoverable or
accessible and in the case of Facebook, there&#39;s a question of
ownership and permanence.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been blogging on and off since 2010. Around 300 posts. Not super prolific
but I&#39;ve been doing it long enough to maybe be able to share a bit of
perspective.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure exactly why I started. In part I was inspired by my wife
who at the time was blogging about her <a href="http://squid-knits.blogspot.com/">knitting</a>. I was also inspired
to share my thoughts after meeting some fellow CS teachers from across
the country at a <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2010-01-02-welcome.html">CSTA event in Chicago</a>. It was stop and go for a while
and then I took a break. I was re-inspired months later after meeting
a couple of CS teachers at another CSTA event - <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=ben%2520chun&amp;src=typd">Ben Chun</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/purplespatula">Helene
Martin.</a> Both terrific high school CS teachers at the time who are
unfortunately no longer in the classroom (unfortunate for the kids, I
wish Ben and Helene all happiness and success in all their
endeavors). We all agreed to try to write more and that got me started
again. I&#39;ve been posting around 50 times a year since.
</p>
<p>
Looking back to when I used blogger, I had 30 - 50 hits on some early
posts and that was mostly just me hitting the site. It didn&#39;t matter.
Writing has let me work through my thoughts. It also creates a record of
my thoughts and on how my thinking evolves over time.
</p>
<p>
Over time, people have told me that they&#39;ve found some of the things
I&#39;ve written useful or helpful and I&#39;d argue that when people disagree
with something I write, even if they don&#39;t comment and I&#39;ve all I&#39;ve
evoked is a reaction of &#34;Z&#39;s full of crap,&#34; it&#39;s gotten them to
re-evaluate their own thoughts on whatever the subject and if it&#39;s
confirmation of their original beliefs, that&#39;s OK.
</p>
<p>
The important thing is that by blogging I&#39;m getting my thoughts down
&#34;on paper&#34; and sharing them for the world to take or leave as they
please and the more of us who do this, the more we expand the sum
knowledge of CS teaches.
</p>
<p>
As a dispersed community of CS teachers across the country, we need
more people blogging on public platforms not in silos like Facebook.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve heard reasons why teachers don&#39;t blog:
</p>
<p>
<strong><strong>I&#39;m new and have nothing to write about</strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
Sure you do – write a paragraph about your plans for the days lesson
or how it went. Vent your frustrations (but be careful not to get
yourself in trouble). Rave about some students work.
</p>
<p>
<strong><strong>I don&#39;t have time</strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
Yes, this is a tough one. If you have to do PD time, maybe your
supervisor will let you use it for blogging. To be honest, when I&#39;m
writing regularly it doesn&#39;t take that long. When I haven&#39;t written in
a while it takes longer. In any event. It&#39;s important and posts don&#39;t
have to be long
</p>
<p>
<strong><strong>I&#39;m not a great writer</strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
This blog is proof that you don&#39;t have to be. I&#39;m stilted and ramble
and certainly no Shakespeare. I am the weakest writer in my household
and it&#39;s not even close. Even so, we all have something to share.
</p>
<p>
<strong><strong>I don&#39;t know how</strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
I was thinking about proposing a session at next years CSTA conference
where I&#39;d work the group through creating a github pages based
blog. In the meantime, there are a lot of easy ways to start out.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="http://blogger.com">http://blogger.com</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="http://wordpress.com">http://wordpress.com</a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
and for those who want total control
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So, there&#39;s my plea. If you&#39;re a CS teacher and you&#39;re reading this
please consider blogging. I assure you, we will all appreciate it and
benefit from it.
