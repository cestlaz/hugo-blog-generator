<p>Back to school last Thursday after almost two week off. Twenty four
hours later - Snow Day. I know this sounds a bit hokey, but I really
would have rather had school. I love a good snow day as much as the
next guy, but after a big vacation, I was really ready to get back to
work with the kids.</p>
<p>Saturday, hacking sessions were set to resume. Being in Manhattan,
getting around was pretty easy but we&rsquo;ve got hackers from all over the
city from Staten Island to the Bronx. Needless to say, some boroughs
were easier to get around in than others.</p>
<p>So, we were a small group - we were down two instructors and a TA but
Batya and Zach were in from college and helping out so instructors
actually outnumbered students!!</p>
<p>What did we do? Since the hackers are just starting on their projects,
this was a great opportunity to work one on one with them. Two of us
went over Javascript and SVG as an alternative to the HTML Canvas,
Zach worked with a couple of people on a Markov chain text generator
and so on. Even though the turn out was low, I&rsquo;m really glad we got
back to business. Weather permitting, we should be back at full
capacity this coming Saturday.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s finally time to start talking to them about git.</p>
