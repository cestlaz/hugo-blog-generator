I like to listen to music at work. Sometimes I just stream from
YouTube, Soundcloud, Spotify or some other online source but if you&#39;re
a person of a certain age, like me, you probably have quite an mp3
collection. All those CDs that have been ripped not to mention some
converted vinyl.

I used to use the <a href="https://www.musicpd.org/">Music Player Daemon</a> or MPD back in the day. It would
run in the background and you could connect to it using lots of
<a href="https://www.musicpd.org/clients/">clients</a>.
</p>
<p>
When I was running Ubuntu and Mint Linux, I had some trouble setting
up MPD but the process is much smoother using Manjaro which is Arch
based and I&#39;m currently enjoying.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s a video on how I set up MPD and also use Emacs to control it.
</p>
<p>
Coincidentally, on the same day I recorded this, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDEtZ7AKmwS0_GNJog01D2g/feed">Uncle Dave</a> put up a
similar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTVN8UDScqk">video</a>. Dave also sets up MPD on an Arch based linux but he
uses EMMS for his player. I ultimately end up with Simple-MPC with
briefs stops at the built in MPC mode and Mingus along the way.
</p>
<p>
Enjoy.
