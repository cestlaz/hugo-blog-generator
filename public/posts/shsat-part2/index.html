Yesterday I shared my thoughts on Bill de Blasio&#39;s plans to &#34;fix&#34; the
selection criteria for New York City&#39;s specialized high schools. If
you haven&#39;t read the post, you can find it <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/shsat/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
I was going to get back to CS and CS Ed related blogging today but
there&#39;s more to the story.
</p>
<p>
In spite of what BdB stated, it&#39;s not enough for him to switch to another
measure - the middle school state exam along with some modifiers. This
is about ending the exam altogether and not replacing it with anything
better. Here&#39;s a link to information on the proposed legislation for
<a href="https://legiscan.com/NY/bill/A10427/2017">New York Assembly Bill 10427</a> including links to the actual text.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of beurobabble but the end game is to basically allow
the chancellor (not sure if this means city or state) to do whatever
they want.
</p>
<p>
Here are some of the key points:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Seats would ultimately go to the top 5 to 7 percent of each middle school&#39;s
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
class.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
These students would have to also be classified in the top 25% city wide.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Top is defined by a composite score of multiple measures as
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
determined by the chancellor which means anything goes.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Remaining seats will be filled by
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
lottery of all students with a 3.7 GPA or greater.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
It&#39;s not clear how the students would be allocated to each of the
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
specialized schools.
</p>
<p>
So, what does this all mean?
</p>
<p>
Multiple measures could mean the state test + average. It could mean
average + recommendation. It could be shoe size + favorite color. The
chancellor also decides how to weight these multiple measures.
</p>
<p>
This means that the politicians can do whatever they want to paint any
picture they want regardless of how their ideological and political
games hurt kids.
</p>
<p>
Any teacher, in fact, any rational adult  will tell you that middle
schools are not interchangeable. The top students at one middle school
are typically not at the same level as top students at another
one. I&#39;m sure you can cluster middle schools in terms of the students
they graduate, what the students know and can do and the clusters will
likely fall on economic lines. This is the problem that BdB should be
addressing not how to rig the specialized school admissions stats.
</p>
<p>
Even if this is done right, you&#39;re assuming an even distribution of
top gifted students across all the middle schools. If one school has
higher concentration of gifted students, they&#39;re out of luck. The end
result is that if you attend an SP or other gifted program for eighth
grade you&#39;ll likely be locked out of the specialized schools. What if
a particular middle school is attractive to all of our top math team
talent? Only a couple will get in to the specialized schools under the
new system since each school is allocated a fixed number of slots.
</p>
<p>
I guess this does make sense if you don&#39;t believe in gifted students
or gifted education but then why not just get rid of the specialized
schools to begin with rather than playing these games. This &#34;solution&#34;
will result in parents having to decide - do I send my kids to the
gifted middle school program and hurt their chances to get into a
specialized high school or do I try to find the lowest performing
school I can find and have my kid stand out. This is pretty messed up.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day, though, you have to remember that any change to
the process can help one group and hurt another. Stuy, for example has
46% of it&#39;s students on free or reduced lunch and is about 70%
Asian. If in the new system you&#39;re increasing the percent population
of an under represented group, you&#39;re likely reducing the percentage
of Asian students. So, you&#39;re creating opportunities for a number of as of yet
undetermined students (who might not be properly prepared for the
experience) at the expense of economically disadvantaged Asian
students who have proven to be prepared for the experience. Wouldn&#39;t
a better solution be to fix the opportunities presented at the middle
schools rather than rig the system of high school acceptance.
</p>
<p>
Going further, a response on another blog noted that BdB probably
refused to do anything with the admissions criteria of the non big
three because they all had numbers that he would consider more
diverse. The commenter provided the Black / Latino percentages, I added the
free and reduced lunch numbers:
</p>
<table border-spacing="10px" frame="border">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>School</th>
<th>Percent Black / Latino</th>
<th>Free / Reduced Lunch</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Brooklyn Latin</td>
<td>28%</td>
<td>61%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HSMSE</td>
<td>26%</td>
<td>46%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HSAS</td>
<td>17%</td>
<td>25%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queens Sci</td>
<td>12%</td>
<td>64%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
All the more reason to run some tests or analysis there. Of course, if
you look further you&#39;ll note that HSAS only has 25% of its students on
free or reduced lunch so is it really doing better than Stuy or Sci
with ~45% low income students  each  or Brooklyn Tech which supports
62% or are we to say that there&#39;s low income and then there&#39;s the
right low income?
</p>
<p>
Certainly the education system needs work but the proposed legislation
is not a solution. It&#39;s taking a flawed but objective measure and
replacing it with essentially chancellor&#39;s discretion.
</p>
<p>
If the legislation passes, by the year 2022 we will have admissions to
what used to be some of the nations finest high schools determined by
a political appointee rather than an objective test.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a shame. It was very important to my wife and me to have our kids
go to public schools and I was very happy to have been able to
navigate the system with them from first grade through high school
graduation with only a few bumps along the way. With this nonsense
from the political left and the privatization push from the political
right (or actually both sides) pretty soon there will be nothing left.
