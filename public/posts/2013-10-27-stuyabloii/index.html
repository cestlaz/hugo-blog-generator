            <p>Last week in my AP classes, we were working on inheritance.</p>
<p>So, what to do?</p>
<p>Last time around I had my classes work on a &ldquo;speed dating&rdquo; program -
StuyDater. Back then JonAlf had his classes work on Stuyablo, that
classic dungeon crawl.</p>
<p>I still plan on reworking the StuyDater project, but first I decided
to do my take on Stuyablo. Of course, we&rsquo;ve improved on it. This time
it&rsquo;s <strong>Stuyablo II</strong>. The next guy will have to do <strong>Stuyablo III - in
3D</strong>.</p>
<p>We used the concept of a base class <strong>Character</strong>:</p>
<p>public class Character {
private int health;
private String name;</p>
<p>public String toString() {
return Name;
}</p>
<p>// etc
}
And then some derived classes such as:</p>
<p>public class Wizard extends Character {
private int mana;
// etc
}</p>
<p>We spend time dealing with public vs private vs protected, issues with
constructors, super and the like but then the weekend was upon us.</p>
<p>So, what was the assignment - we broke up into groups. Each group had
to design one aspect of the project. Some groups had to decide on what
would make up a player character. Perhaps a fighter or a wizard. What
base level attributes are needed? What methods? What do they need as
parameters and what do they return? What will the combat system look
like?</p>
<p>Another groups had to work on non player characters. Yet others
designed the game driver.</p>
<p>None of them were supposed to actually write finished code.</p>
<p>I asked them to bounce around ideas on our mailing list over the
weekend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been amazing to watch the discussion. It&rsquo;s now Saturday evening
and throughout the day there&rsquo;s been a constant flow of ideas and
discussion. I love it when the classes are into the projects.</p>
<p>Monday we&rsquo;re going to sync up, finalize the design, and then start
writing this thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be fun.</p>
