<p>
It wasn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve heard this refrain. Last year I attended
my first CSTA conference. I had numerous conversations with CS
teachers on the fact that everything was on an intro level in terms of
both content and teaching. Further conversations with local teachers
with stronger CS backgrounds led me to run a professional development
session at Hunter this past election day for more experienced CS
teachers at schools that offered more than the basics.
</p>
<p>
While it&#39;s not surprising that most of the PD opportunities for CS teachers are
rather rudimentary given that nationally most programs are new and
most teachers are new to the subject but there are a few deeper
reasons.
</p>
<p>
To start, there are big players in the CS Ed movement that are pushing
curricula and specific programs and that leads to scripted PD for
their products and not depth of knowledge nor deep pedagogical content
knowledge let alone basic pedagogy. Add to this the fact that many of
the &#34;thought leaders&#34; in the space don&#39;t have experience teaching CS
at the K12 level and in many cases don&#39;t have a background either in
teaching nor tech and you can see where the problem comes from. On top
of this we have the erosion of respect for teaching as a profession
where reformers are trying to take the teacher out of teaching and are
trying to reduce pedagogy to following scripts. This problem goes well
beyond CS Ed but as the new kid on the block it probably hits us
hardest.
</p>
<p>
In any case, preparing beginners is both necessary and appropriate for
the time being but we can and must do a better job than what&#39;s
currently &#34;state of the art.&#34; At the same time we have to do something
with the CS teachers who indeed do have strong content knowledge but
don&#39;t feel comfortable with imparting that knowledge.
</p>
<p>
So, what should we do?
</p>
<p>
For new teachers the solution will ultimately have to come
from pre-service programs but what we end up getting is going to
largely be dictated on what&#39;s required by individual states. If states
merely require passing an exam like the Praxis CS exam which, from
what I can gather isn&#39;t a horrible content exam then we&#39;re going to
see CS teachers bumble through their early to mid careers while trying
to figure out how to teach CS much like I did way back when. If they
end up endorsing pre-service programs that are focused on specific
curricula - APCS-A for teachers, APCS-P for teachers, <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/math-for-math-teachers/">Math for Math
teachers</a> if you will but for CS, we&#39;re also not going to get strong
well prepared pedagogues. On the other hand if you can design a
program that has a strong pedagogical component to go along with the
content, you have a chance. Even with a well designed program
implementation will still be a challenge. Who will teach it? Education
professors who don&#39;t have CS backgrounds? CS professors with little
pedagogical training? Neither of those groups necessarily have any
real experience as actual K12 teachers. If you can find honest to
goodness experienced, strong K12 CS teachers to teach your pedagogy
courses that&#39;s a big win but that&#39;s going to be hard in most cases.
</p>
<p>
I think we designed a great program at Hunter and have a practical and
strong implementation plan. If you&#39;re going to be
at CSTA2018 you can hear all about it and why we designed it as we did
in the talk I&#39;m giving.
</p>
<p>
For the more experienced I don&#39;t have a universal answer but I can say
what I&#39;m planning. Teachers in NY have to complete 100 CTLE hours
every five years. For beginners, there are plenty of options, at least
content wise. For teachers who know CS, not so much. I was at a meetup
talking to a few friends a couple of weeks ago and one mentioned that
they get most of their hours in Math for America CS
workshops. Unfortunately more than a few of my CS teacher friends who
are in MFA tell me that the CS content in these workshops, while they
do satisfy the hours, are somewhat lacking on the CS / CS pedagogy
side.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s what I&#39;m planning - we (Hunter) will host a once a month
dinner/session for CS teachers who are a little farther along CS
wise. I haven&#39;t worked out all the details yet but I&#39;ve got a few tech
companies that are already interested in sponsoring and helping out
should we need anything and we&#39;ll probably set most of our agenda for
the year at the first session where I&#39;ll make my best guess at a
useful agenda. This is something I&#39;m pretty excited about. It should
help create a network of more experienced CS teachers which will both
help bolster that segment of the community and provide a long term
resource to newcomers and it should be a lot of fun.
</p>
<p>
In some ways, this is why I ended up joining Hunter. Regardless of
what the city and state do, we&#39;re going to prepare the teachers and if
you have a well prepared teacher, you&#39;ve got a shot.
