I&#39;ve been planning to put together a response to <a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo">Alfred Thompson</a>&#39;s
recent post - <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/02/software-developersquantity-vs-quality.html">Software Developers - Quantity vs Quality</a>.
</p>
<p>
TL;DR, although it isn&#39;t really long and I do encourage you to read
Alfred&#39;s post: a couple of articles talk about how the U.S. has the most
people entering CS competitions like HackerRank but Americans are not
at the top of the leaderboard. does this mean that there&#39;s less talent
in America? Does it even matter?
</p>
<p>
Before getting to &#34;does it matter,&#34; I looked over at the Kaggle
leaderboards. Looking at their top 10, 2 were from the US - no other
country had more than 1. The 11th placing competitor was also from the
US and then 12 was from China, giving them 2 in the top 12.  I also
looked at recent <a href="http://stats.ioinformatics.org/delegations/2016?sort=total_desc">IOI results</a> and a quick glance seems to indicate that
the USA seems to do reasonably well. In short, if you buy into ranking
a country by these types of individual results on specific
competitions then we&#39;re doing fine.
</p>
<p>
But, does filling the leaderboard mean a country&#39;s producing the best
tech talent? Probably not.
</p>
<p>
Coding competitions focus on a specific skill set. There are problem
solving aspects but they also require speed, knowledge of data
structures and algorithms, and, yes, even accurate, fast typing
skills. They also require you work alone. They don&#39;t encourage well
designed, architected, or written code, working on existing code bases
or working with a team.
</p>
<p>
Over the years, I&#39;ve known some very smart and talented individuals
who&#39;ve excelled at these types of competitions. If you extend the pool
to math and science competitions, I&#39;ve known quite a few. These
individuals have by and large done well for themselves but as a group,
you couldn&#39;t call them more successful than any other subset of my
former students. A number of them have gone on and are doing well as
professors or programmers but, by and large, they&#39;re not the ones
who&#39;ve gone on to found companies and provide jobs for scores or even
hundreds of other people and they&#39;re not necessarily the ones who&#39;ve
led teams that have developed major platforms and projects[fn::Some
are but probably a smaller percent from that group than from the
general pool.]
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t argue that people who populate competition leaderboards are
talented and a necessary part of our tech ecosystem but they&#39;re only a
part. I probably want one of these programmers on my team, but not as
the entire team (see Fake Grimlock&#39;s laws of startups - <a href="http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/secret-laws-startups-part-2-build-right-team">law 9</a>).

/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>
<p>
Competitive programming is a piece of the puzzle as competitive
programmers are a part of the population. So are project based events
like <a href="https://dreamitcodeitwinit.wordpress.com/">Dream it. Code it. Win it.</a>, science fairs, and hackathons, which
can be either cooperative, competitive, or a combination.
</p>
<p>
What do we want? Balance. I think the Stuy program does it pretty
well. StuyCS graduates who wish to take part in coding competitions
can do so but if they want to excel at it, they have to work at it on
their own time. At the same time, the students learn how to work in
teams and take a project from idea to delivery all the while learning
some good academic CS and software engineering practices. They&#39;ll
learn more in college on the academic side and the rest on the
job. I&#39;d love to see better balance in the colleges between CS
programs preparing kids for graduate programs and CS programs that
prepare kids for industry. I&#39;d also love to see CS minors that were
more targeted towards CS+X rather than half of a CS major targeting
students going to grad schools.
</p>
<p>
I also think there&#39;s a tremendous opportunity for community colleges
to fill the role currently occupied by code schools. They could more
easily strike a balance between academic depth and practical
preparation.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m working on building Hunter College&#39;s honors CS program and while I
can&#39;t move the Hunter curriculum, I&#39;m seeking that balance in my own
way.
</p>
<p>
Will we get there? I don&#39;t know. Given the way education works, I
figure at some point people will decide that we have to have more of a
presence on the CS leaderboards and we&#39;ll see programs pop up with
that in mind. I have no doubt that when that happens, we&#39;ll see many
more Americans near the top. We have a large enough population that
talent shouldn&#39;t be in question. This will be great for students to
whom these competitions attract. It won&#39;t do much, however for the
rest of the students. I&#39;m not really concerned one way or
another. Unlike math, where there&#39;s a natural progression through K12
math classes with math team and math competitions being a natural add
on, the driving forces in CS - be they from industry, government, or
academia don&#39;t seem to have partaken in any code competition Kool-Aid
so code competitions won&#39;t become a driving force in CS ed any time
soon.
