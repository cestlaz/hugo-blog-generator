We&#39;re now at the end of my first semester at Hunter. The Spring term
classes don&#39;t start until the end of January. I&#39;ve got an assortment
of projects to work on but some of the students should have a nice
block of relatively free time.
</p>
<p>
I  wanted to share some recommendations on things to explore with a
few student groups and thought it would be easier to write those
recommendations down here once and then just share a link.
</p>
<p>
So, here we go.
</p>
<p>
Much of the first few CS classes at Hunter and elsewhere focus on the
fundamentals of programming, data structures, and algorithms. It&#39;s all
good stuff but students want to supplement that classroom knowledge
with some practical skills.
</p>
<p>
I recommend playing with a language like Python that can be used in
all sorts of domains. If you haven&#39;t played with it, check it out.
</p>
<p>
I like <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</a> as a nice, free, online
text.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d also recommend learning a web platform like <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask.</a> Flask is a web
framework in Python. The web site has a nice getting started guide and
tutorial but here are a couple of other great learning Flask
resources:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/realpython/discover-flask">Discover Flask</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://exploreflask.com/en/latest/">Explore Flask</a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once armed with the above, you&#39;ll be well positioned to work on a
variety of your own projects, enter hackathons, and more.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also a big believer in using good tools. I love the emacs text
editor. Why not spend some time going through the web series on <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs">Using
Emacs</a>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, if you&#39;re not using Git, you should be. Here are a couple of
playlists to get you started:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq0VzNtDZbe9QLq8YCizFN2TVWvlLjrvX"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq0VzNtDZbe9QLq8YCizFN2TVWvlLjrvX">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq0VzNtDZbe9QLq8YCizFN2TVWvlLjrvX</a></a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoGsJC6ZzSwm959Do9ZgZM9U-xp27NEaQ"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoGsJC6ZzSwm959Do9ZgZM9U-xp27NEaQ">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoGsJC6ZzSwm959Do9ZgZM9U-xp27NEaQ</a></a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And if you haven&#39;t done so already, head over to <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">Github Education</a> and
sign up for a student developer pack.
</p>
<p>
So, there are a few recommendations on things to work on before the
next term begins.
</p>
<p>
Enjoy
