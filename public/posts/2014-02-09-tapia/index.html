            <p>Spent the past few days at the <a href="http://tapiaconference.org">Tapia Conference</a> in Seattle.</p>
<p>The Tapia conference is billed as a &ldquo;Celebration of Diversity in
Computing.&rdquo; The bulk of the attendees seemed to be
students. Undergrads and grads. The undergrads were mostly juniors and
seniors, but a bunch of freshmen and sophomores were there as well. Of
course there were faculty members to join them as well as people from
industry.</p>
<p>What was I doing there? Well, 20 high school teachers were given
scholarships to attend a workshop run by
<a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/garcia.html">Dan Garcia</a>. Dan
is the driving force behind one of the implementations of CS
Principals course - a new course being rolled out by the College
Board. As you&rsquo;re all well aware, I&rsquo;m not a fan of the College Board
but I&rsquo;m interested in Dan&rsquo;s work as common friends speak well of
him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about his course next time, after I&rsquo;ve gone through his
workshop. For now, let&rsquo;s talk about the conference.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect but let me tell you, I was blown
away. Many of the break out sessions didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;speak&rdquo; to me as a high
school teacher, but that&rsquo;s fine - the conference was for the
youngsters. I can&rsquo;t say for sure, but it seemed to me that they really
hit the breakout sessions on the head.</p>
<p>Then there were the plenaries. Great speakers and a great range of topics.</p>
<p>They had:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cieko Asakawa talking about assistive technologies</li>
<li>Dan Garcia on CS Education</li>
<li>Latanya Sweeney - transparency and privacy</li>
<li>James McLurkin - robotics (and some computational geometry)</li>
<li>Kathryn McKinley - Systems</li>
<li>Marcus Mitchel - A general talk on hard problems, winding paths, and more</li>
</ul>
<p>An incredible rage of topics. All the speakers were terrific - they
all talked about their life and career paths and were all
inspirational</p>
<p>They also presented a smorgasbord of computer science possibilities
for the students.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I wish this could be bottled up and given to all aspiring technologists.</p>
<p>I only got to attend because I was on scholarship as a high school CS
teacher. It was an amazing few days and I can&rsquo;t recommend the Tapia
conference highly enough for young computer scientists out there.</p>
