One of the things I&#39;ve heard for years from former students - both
those looking for jobs and those looking to hire is that colleges
don&#39;t really do a good job preparing students for careers in
tech. Sure they teach the algorithms and the theory but ther are a lot
of missing pieces, particularly on the practical end. I&#39;m certainly
not advocating turning CS programs into coding schools but there are
many low cost opportunities to bring practical real world best
practices in to the CS classroom. I most recently wrote about <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/testing-part2%0A">unit
testing</a> and had earlier about using <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse-2017-github-4">GitHub as an educational
tool</a>. I&#39;ve been happy with the way I introduce students to Git and
how we use GitHub in my classes but I&#39;ve never found a smooth way to
introduce Pull Requests. A pull request is basically a mechanism by
which one can suggest a change to a project even if you don&#39;t own
it. The project owner can then decide to merge it in or not.
</p>
<p>
Being comfortable with the pull request work flow is an important part
of contributing to open source projects. The basic process is that you
make a copy of the project you want to work on by forking it, make
your changes, then issue a pull request back to the project. For a
beginner, there are a lot of moving parts. Instead, I teach my
students branching and merging within a project. It&#39;s much easier and
arguably more useful for day to day projects. I&#39;d like my kid to learn the
pull request mechanics but I haden&#39;t thought of a good way to do it.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also wanted to give kids more real world experiences in class and
one experience they rarely get is working in other people&#39;s code
bases. In school you largely write your own projects be they group or
solo or work off a hopefully tried and true code base provided by the
instructor. In the real world you&#39;re frequently working off of someone
elses code and it&#39;s rarely in a polished state.
</p>
<p>
I finally found a way to kill both birds with one stone. A couple of
weeks ago my class&#39; lab was rather lengthy. It involved reading in a
source file and reformating it in a sensible way. I knew most of the
students wouldn&#39;t finish it in the allotted time and even if they did,
this was an easy assignment to extend. On lab day I had students
create a new repo for this lab (normally they just add a folder in a
their &#34;labs&#34; repo) and get as much done as they could. The rule was
simple - push what you&#39;ve got up to GitHub at the end of class and
then you can&#39;t push anything else. I also made it clear that I didn&#39;t
expect a completed lab..
</p>
<p>
We continued the lab in the next class session. This time. I randomly
assigned repos to students so that they would fork someone elses
lab. They then had to complete the lab on the other students code base
and then issue a pull request back to the original
</p>
<p>
This was the first time I&#39;ve tried this so it was a little
klunky. I&#39;ll do a much better job specifying the assignment and
instructions next time around but even so I think the class went
well. By the end of the class the students had sucesfully forked a
project, issued a pull request, and merged one in to their own
project. The only think I wasn&#39;t happy with was that many of the
merges happened automatically. I have to figure out how to set things
up so that there are merge conflicts since I want my students to
experience that.
</p>
<p>
Overall,  I was very happy with the way things worked out. The
students were able to experience important real workd software
engineering techniques without removing any of the academic CS in the
class.
