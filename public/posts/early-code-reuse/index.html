I&#39;ve been following the tweets coming out of <a href="https://icer.acm.org/">ICER2018</a>. I&#39;ve never been
to ICER but now am thinking about trying to get funding to go next
year. One set of tweets involved students writing or using APIs or
Libraries. This overlaps with Owen Astrachan&#39;s talk from this past
year&#39;s CSTA conference on sorting. I was planning on writing a post
about Owen&#39;s talk but I thought I&#39;d leave it for the school year
closer to when sorting is typically covered.
</p>
<p>
The points alluded to in the tweets go far deeper than can be
addressed in one blog post and are more suited to the sorting post
I&#39;ll write later on but I thought I&#39;d share a lab that I stole from a
friend of mine years ago to try to get the kids to abstract code into
functions or methods early and to start to think about reusing blocks
of code.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve talked about abstracting out and reusing code <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/refactoring">before</a>, after
students have covered repetition but this lab
can be done even earlier.  Part of the motivation is the age old
problem of objects / functions / methods early or control structures
early. With o/f/m early kids think about decomposition, layers, and
abstractions but they don&#39;t have the tools to do a whole lot of
interesting things. On the other hand, with control structures early,
kids tend to get in the mindset of throwing everything in &#34;main&#34; at
the top level.
</p>
<p>
This lab tries to get the kids abstracting out and reusing or sharing
code but doesn&#39;t require much more than methods or functions.
</p>
<p>
The idea is to create an ASCII art robot or something similar. Of
course, this could also be done in a graphical environment:
</p>
<pre class="example">

######################
#                    #
#   XX          XX   #
#                    #
#       XXXXX        #
#                    #
######################
###
###
#############
#           #
########           ########
#           #
#           #
#           #
#############
##      ##
##      ##
##      ##
_
</pre>
<p>
This can easily be done with a series of output instructions or
possibly by building a string with embedded newlines.
</p>
<p>
The interesting part comes when you have the student write different
functions for the parts of the robot - the head, body, and legs.
</p>
<p>
Students end up with routines like this:
</p>
<div class="src src-java">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
and then can generate their robot:
</p>
<div class="src src-java">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Now for the fun part. Students can make a variety of heads, legs, and
bodies. Going further, introduce if statements and random numbers and
they can generate random robots:
</p>
<div class="src src-java">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Not the most elegant code but this can be done VERY early when the
students don&#39;t know more advanced constructs and techniques.
</p>
<p>
The class can also share robot &#34;components&#34; as long as there&#39;s a
simple code sharing mechanism - perhaps using <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/">gists</a>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, this can be revisited if desired later on once the class has
covered more advanced language constructs.
