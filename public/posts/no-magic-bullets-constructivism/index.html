The most recent NYC CSTA chapter meeting was &#34;How do I assess CS?&#34; I
wanted to go but it&#39;s been such a crazy month I was just too wiped
out. Fortunately, the meetup was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIMKAZbHAiA&amp;index=83&amp;list=WL&amp;t=1796s">recorded</a>. I was able to watch the
first half this morning while working out on my <a href="https://www.staczero.com/hero">stationary trainer</a>
which leads me to today&#39;s rare Saturday morning blog
post. The meetup consisted of two panels. The first was made up of K12
teachers who taught CS. I can&#39;t talk about the second panel yet since I&#39;m
only halfway through but there were a couple of points made by my
friend <a href="https://twitter.com/KatieJergens">Katie Jergens</a> who teaches at Dalton that I thought were worth
talking about.
</p>
<p>
The first was when Katie noted that through working with the panel,
one of her takeaways was that:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Giving students an explicit strategy for solving a problem - &#34;this is
how I would do it….,&#34; - giving them an explicit strategy first and then giving them a
problem for which that strategy would apply is much more effective than
having them discover it on their own.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This was refreshing to hear after being beaten over the head on
discovery learning and constructivism for the past five or so
years as being the magic bullet for teachers. I shared more thoughts
on this a few weeks ago when I wrote about a SIGCSE paper presented by
<a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse2018-bootstrap/">Bootstrap World</a> that I very much liked.
</p>
<p>
Katie went on to talk about how the group found that while &#34;discovery
learning&#34; can be effective it can also be frustrating and lose kids
along the way. It also takes a lot of time and preparation, something
that&#39;s short on supply in most public schools.
</p>
<p>
This made me think about the recent flurry
of discussion around the debunking of learning styles which had
previously been the magic bullet. When I started, the secret sauce was cooperative
learning.
</p>
<p>
Of course any good teacher knows there&#39;s no magic bullet. You fill
your tool belt and chest with as much as you can and use what&#39;s
best based on your strengths as a teacher combined with what will work
best with your students.
</p>
<p>
Another point that Katie made that I found refreshing had to do with
something she does with her classes. A good portion of a student&#39;s grade is
based on what she calls a &#34;booster.&#34; Each student has to work one on
one with her on some project. The student either scores a 0 or a 100 -
the student keeps working with the direct support of the teacher until
it&#39;s perfect.
</p>
<p>
The important thing that Katie said with respect to this is &#34;I can
do this because my largest class is sixteen students.&#34; No way could
this ever scale to a public school where a teacher can meet with over
150 students a day and barely has time eat lunch let alone
work one on one with a student in a suitably quiet place like an
office. The refreshing thing to hear was the acknowledgment of the
fact that what works in a rich private school won&#39;t work in a public
school.
</p>
<p>
All to often education and yes, CS Ed is driven by people who
really have no clue. They&#39;re anointed as thought leaders but they
don&#39;t walk the walk. Some have some knowledge and experience but many
don&#39;t. Until you&#39;ve gotten a few years under your belt in a strap
cashed public school that takes all comers, don&#39;t tell them how they
should do it. Katie didn&#39;t - she acknowledged the problem - too bad so
many others don&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m looking forward to watching the rest of the video during a future
workout and might have more to share then. For now, take a look for
yourself.
