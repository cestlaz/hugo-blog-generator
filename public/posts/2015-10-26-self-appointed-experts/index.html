So, on November 12, one can head over to Uber and listen to three
experts talk about K12 CS Education. To quote the landing page:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How can we engage our students in CS, and train our teachers to teach it?</li>
<li>What are the biggest obstacles to overcome?</li>
<li>What is the future of K-12 CS Education?</li>
<li>What's working?`</li>
</ul>

<p>
Sound great.
</p>

<p>
The problem?
</p>

<p>
Who are these expert voices that we're supposed to be listening to.
</p>

<p>
The panel consists of three people: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=ADEAAACdvOoBuWtX0sqm4gkJmOZ0AxArrQJgvnQ&amp;authType=OPENLINK&amp;authToken=IPmC&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=9425671445893373413&amp;srchindex=1&amp;srchtotal=1&amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A9425671445893373413%2CVSRPtargetId%3A10337514%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary%2CVSRPnm%3Atrue%2CauthType%3AOPENLINK%0A">Adam Enbar</a> of Flatiron School,

of CS Education for the New York City Department of Education.
</p>

<p>
Sounds interesting.
</p>

<p>
As a disclaimer, I have to say that I know Adam and Rebecca and
consider them friends. I like ScriptEd and what they do in the
schools. In fact, I think that my CSTUY programs are terrific next
steps for ScriptEd kids. ScriptEd is becoming good at what they do and
I think they're also aware of their limitations as an ed program. I
also know that Flatiron has done a solid job retraining adults for the
workforce. I don't think I've ever met Debbie Marcus. I also believe
all these people are well meaning.
</p>

<p>
What's the lay of the land?
</p>

<p>
Given her position, Ms. Marcus will be considered a voice of
authority and I can't seem to go to a CS Ed event without someone from
the Flatiron School or someone from ScriptEd there in a place
indicating that they should be considered an  authority on K12 CS
Education.
</p>

<p>
As much as I like what ScriptEd does in the schools and as much as the
Flatiron School has a strong reputation as an adult coding school
/ workforce program should these voices be the ones we're listening
to?
</p>

<p>
Let's dig deeper.
</p>

<p>
Higher up in this post, I link to all three panelists LinkedIn
profiles. All three are conspicuously missing one thing - experience
in CS and Rebecca is the only one who's LinkedIn profile indicates any
time teaching.
</p>

<p>
Now, let's contrast that with the CSTUY and Stuy teams. Regular
readers know what I've done building Stuyvesant's CS program and CSTUY
over the past 25 years and if you look at my team they all have
considerably more CS experience, Ed experience, and of course CS Ed
experience.
</p>

<p>
Who's driving the train?
</p>

<p>
Who's being excluded?
</p>

<p>
What's wrong with this picture.
