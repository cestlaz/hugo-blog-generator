About a week ago New York State&#39;s new regulation creating a <a href="http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20180327/NEWS/180329893/new-york-will-finally-have-certified-computer-science-teachers">K12 CS
teacher certification</a> went live. Just the other day I was honored to be
interviewed by  <a href="https://twitter.com/mflamm_reporter">Matt Flamm</a> of Crain&#39;s New York in a <a href="http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20180410/TECHNOLOGY/180419999/asked-answered-teacher-changed-jobs-to-push-for-new-york-states-new">follow up piece</a>
about it.
</p>
<p>
Having K12 CS teacher certification is big and having quality programs
that lead to certification is <strong>HUGE</strong>. In my view, it&#39;s a game changer.
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s Focus on high school, my wheelhouse.
</p>
<p>
From a course offerings point of view it&#39;s the wild west. I don&#39;t mean
this as a bad thing, it&#39;s just that there&#39;s a huge range of offerings
from AP to home brew, physical computing, game based, cyber security,
you name it, there&#39;s a curriculum. The long and short of this is that
schools need teachers to teach all of these experiences. Without a
strong certification pathway we&#39;re going to be stuck with the current
training based model where teachers are trained to deliver canned
curricula rather than truly teach. With strong teacher preparation
programs teachers will be prepared not only to deliver all the
existing curricula but, arguable more importantly design their own
learning experiences appropriate for the populations they work with.
</p>
<p>
This is important and alone would make having CS certification
worthwhile but to me the BIG win is that it creates a viable career
path.
</p>
<p>
People say we&#39;ll never find enough CS teachers because the tech
industry pays so well. I&#39;ve never believed that. We find math teachers
even though many could flee to finance and chem teachers in spite of
big pharma&#39;s call so why can&#39;t we find CS teachers? Because we&#39;ve
never provided a path into the profession and a viable career track.
</p>
<p>
Certification means that over time schools will be able to build CS
teachers and the discipline will be treated as the other
subjects. Prior to certification, a CS teacher might be cut if a
school&#39;s math department downsized. With certification, the career
track for a CS teacher is the same as the track for any other teacher.
</p>
<p>
It also means that young people starting out who are interested in
both teaching and computer science will have a way of getting into the
profession - something that has never before existed.
</p>
<p>
Having CS certification alone won&#39;t woo a
plethora of current tech professionals into teaching but over time,
we&#39;ll start to have CS Ed majors or CS majors pursuing CS ED Masters
degrees and entering the profession. This won&#39;t happen in a press or
election cycle but it will happen.
</p>
<p>
This all hinges on quality prep programs. I think I&#39;ve hit the sweet
spot with what I&#39;ve designed at Hunter. The critical components are of
course content and pedagogy. Teacher candidates must have both
sufficient depth and breadth in the subject and all the pedagogical
content knowledge that comes along with it. I don&#39;t agree with the
common approach of taking a course to teach a course - that is, having
courses like &#34;APCS - Principles for teachers&#34; or &#34;APCS - A for
teachers.&#34;  I want my teachers to be able to teach any reasonable
curriculum or design their own so we&#39;ll be rolling out courses that
examine the commonly offerd curricula but prepare teachers for a whole
lot more.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been an exciting week in NY CS Ed and there&#39;s a lot more to come.
