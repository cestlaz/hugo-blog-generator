I&#39;ve been working on a vue.js project this summer. During the school
year I really can&#39;t dive into code so it&#39;s been fun.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve already showed you most of the Emacs tools I use for
development. Projectile, Ace-Window, IBuffer, Swiper / Ivy and
all. One thing I couldn&#39;t easily do was arrange windows the way I
wanted.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been setting up Emacs with one large window and a couple of
smaller ones:
</p>
<p>
<img src="/img/touch-elisp.png" alt="/img/touch-elisp.png" title="/img/touch-elisp.png" />
</p>
<p>
I can easily switch the buffer in the window and I can easily switch
windows but what I wanted to do was swap the buffer in the large
window with one of the smaller buffers and leave focus in the larger
buffer:
</p>
<p>
<img src="/img/touch-elisp2.png" alt="/img/touch-elisp2.png" title="/img/touch-elisp2.png" />
</p>
<p>
I started looking at perspective mode and persp mode but neither work
with the latest Emacs. After poking around at other packages I
realized that ace-window does most of what I wanted. Ace-window has a
function that swaps the buffers in two windows named
<code>ace-swap-window</code>. The only problem is that it leaves the focus on the
window you swap to not the one you started in. Ace-window also has
<code>aw-flip-window</code> which then returns the cursor to the previous window.
</p>
<p>
With a little elisp, we get the behavior I was looking for which I
then bound to <code>C-1 z</code>:
</p>
<div class="src src-emacs-lisp">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-emacs-lisp" data-lang="emacs-lisp"><div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-emacs-lisp" data-lang="emacs-lisp">(defun z/swap-windowsn ()
<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&#34;</span>
(interactive)
(ace-swap-window)
(aw-flip-window)
)

(<span style="color:#a6e22e">define-key</span> z-map (kbd <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;w&#34;</span>) <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;z/swap-windows</span>)</code></pre></div></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
The video goes into more details but it shows that if you&#39;re not
afraid to explore a bit you can pretty much get Emacs to do whatever
you want.
