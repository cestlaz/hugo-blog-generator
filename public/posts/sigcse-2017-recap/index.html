As a high school teacher, I was never able to attend SIGCSE, the
conference of the ACM&#39;s Special Interest Group on Computer Science
Education. Between the number of instructional days I would lose and
the cost, I could never justify going. Instead I looked over the
proceedings and read many of the papers.
</p>
<p>
Now that I&#39;m at Hunter, I was finally able to attend. This year in
Seattle, the conference ran from Wednesday through Saturday. I was
part of a panel on &#34;Tools we can&#39;t live without.&#34; Over the next few
weeks, I hope to blog about a number of things I thought and talked
with people about over the conference including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The path I use to teach git and why GitHub a good teaching tool
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
(my talk).
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The relationship of different CS Ed stakeholders - teachers,
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
researchers, organizations, etc.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Teaching at the high school level vs college - perceptions and
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
reality.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The challenges of tech tool adoption in schools.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
What&#39;s going on in K12 CS Certification.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Maybe some other stuff.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Today, some overall thoughts.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-1">
The good
</h2>
<p>
As with many conferences, the &#34;hallway track&#34; along with receptions
sponsored by <a href="https://csnyc.org/our-work/cs4all">the CS4All consurtium</a>, <a href="http://tealsk12.org">TEALS</a>, <a href="http://code.org">Code.org</a> were terrific. I
was able to finally meet in person many people who I&#39;ve only known
virtually and got to know many more as well. I left the conference
with a much larger address book and a long list of follow up
items. Being in Seattle, I also enjoyed being able to spend time with
people from <a href="http://tealsk12.org">TEALS</a> and <a href="http://code.org">Code.org</a>, two of the CS Ed groups working hard
to do some real good (yes - I do like and support these guys even
though I call them out on things I disagree with, but that&#39;s the
subject of another post).
</p>
<p>
I attended sessions on CS certification, teacher preparation,
assessments, POGIL based instruction to name a few. They ranged from
valuable to interesting and to be honest, a couple of &#34;what were they
thinking&#34; but the overall experience was very much worth the trip. I
also got to speak to a number of wonderful students at the
poster sessions.
</p>
<p>
The keynotes are also well worth a read (sorry if you don&#39;t have ACM
digital library access). <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3025045&amp;CFID=738971273&amp;CFTOKEN=22106692">Jeannette Wing</a> talked about the importance of
probability and statistics in CS Ed, and aspects of  <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3025047&amp;CFID=738971273&amp;CFTOKEN=22106692">Gail Chapman</a>&#39;s talk
&#34;Inspire, Innovate, and Improve…&#34; keynote and <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3025046&amp;CFID=738971273&amp;CFTOKEN=22106692">Mitch Resnick</a>&#39;s
&#34;Fulfilling Papert&#39;s Dream&#34; both spoke to the educator inside me.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-2">
The bad
</h2>
<p>
The biggest downside to me was that I found very little value added in
a number of the paper sessions over just reading the papers. Part of
this is probably because of my own over-inflated expectations given the
number of years I&#39;ve waited to attend. Part of it though, was the fact
that sessions were so tightly packed that I didn&#39;t have time to follow
up with presenters before having to run to the next
thing. Unfortunately, in some
cases, it was because the presenter merely
&#34;read&#34; the paper much as a professor sometimes just reads the slides
or the book to his class.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-3">
Other thoughts
</h2>
<p>
One paper presentation I very much liked was <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3017701&amp;CFID=738971273&amp;CFTOKEN=22106692">Exam Wrappers: Not a
Silver Bullet</a> presented by <a href="https://michellecraig.github.io/">Michelle Craig</a> and <a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~bdstephe/">Ben Stephenson</a>. I
actually came in late since I was hustling over from the Code.org
lunch. The result was that I didn&#39;t actually know what &#34;Exam Wrappers&#34;
were until well after the talk when I ran into <a href="https://twitter.com/jkhuggins">Jim Huggins</a>. Exam
wrappers, in short, are merely when you require the students fill out something
for some credit when picking up their exams. The funny thing is that
it&#39;s a strategy that high school teachers have used for years without
a special name and we already knew the good and bad of it without the
research but that&#39;s not what I want to get at here. What I loved about
the talk, besides the fact that Ben and Michelle are clearly strong
presenters is that this was a negative result that was being
presented. I also loved the fact that they didn&#39;t present their
research as gospel but rather pointed out the strengths and weaknesses
of their approach - they made a case to what and why we should pay
attention to and what should be taken with a grain of salt.
</p>
<p>
This was a major breath of fresh air after being exposed to so much
education &#39;research&#39; over the course of my life that the author or
presenter felt was just as strong as a mathematical proof rather than
an indication based on a specific experience or small set of
experiences.
</p>
<p>
I also felt a little weird at times during the week when west coast people seemed
to know me. I know I&#39;m a loud mouthed curmudgeon and I go on my
periodic ed rants but given the dearth of comments on this blog I was
really surprised to get as many as &#34;great to meet you in person after
reading your blog&#34; or &#34;we know you and your work&#34; all week. It was
weird and somewhat humbling.
</p>
<p>
Finally, another highlight f`or me was that I got to catch up with
some of family.

Already planning to submit something to present at SIGCSE 2018 in Baltimore.
