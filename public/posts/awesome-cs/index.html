One of the things I mentioned in my post on the <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-educators-stackexchange/">CS Educators
StackExchange</a> was the fragmentation of resources for CS Educators. My
friend and fellow CS teacher Ben pointed out that this is appropriate
as we&#39;re so young as a community. He&#39;s absolutely right but until we
mature, discover-ability can be a problem. We all have our resources
and I for one am frequently surprised when talking to a friend and
discovering that they don&#39;t know about a site or a mailing list that
I&#39;ve known about for years. Likewise, I&#39;m appreciative when others
share resources with me.
</p>
<p>
There are some collections of information, for instance, <a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo">Alfred
Thompson</a> has a list of CS Education bloggers but it&#39;s not so easy to
discover and it certainly shouldn&#39;t fall on Alfred to maintain such
a list making sure the links are all active and always being
responsible for adding new ones.
</p>
<p>
Recently I&#39;ve noticed a proliferation of <strong><strong>awesome</strong></strong>
lists. These are community curated lists hosted up on GitHub for a
variety of projects. I find myself using <a href="https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs">awesome-emacs</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python">awesome-python</a> more and more and there are tons of other such lists.
</p>
<p>
I thought we, as a community could benefit from such a list.
</p>
<p>
I started one off. It&#39;s over at
<a href="https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education"><a href="https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education">https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education</a></a> with instructions on
contributing at
<a href="https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education/blob/master/contributing.org"><a href="https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education/blob/master/contributing.org">https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education/blob/master/contributing.org</a></a>.
</p>
<p>
I seeded it with a few items but I&#39;d love everyone to get involved. I
also started it with a few categories and a specific format but I&#39;d
love to see that evolve into something most useful for the community
as well.
</p>
<p>
If you agree that this could be something useful, please contribute to
it and help spread the word.
