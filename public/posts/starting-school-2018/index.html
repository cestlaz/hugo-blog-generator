Today was the first day of school for all NYC teachers. Students come
back tomorrow. That&#39;s a quick turnaround. Some years, they get a day
or two before the kids come in. That&#39;s much easier.
</p>
<p>
The first day is usually dominated by meetings. In a large school like
Stuy you&#39;ll typically have a long faculty meeting in the morning and a
department meeting in the afternoon. Not much time to actually get
ready for classes. You might think that it shouldn&#39;t be a big deal
since you had all summer but in NYC where budgets don&#39;t come out until
the summer for teachers not to know exactly what or when they&#39;re
teaching until the first day back.
</p>
<p>
Things started at Hunter college last week but things are different
there. I was excited to my students but the overall energy isn&#39;t the
same. We&#39;re two weeks in and I still haven&#39;t seen most of my CS
colleagues. In the high school, everyone comes back at once.
</p>
<p>
In any event. It&#39;s an exciting time in what should be an exciting year
for CS teachers and students.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not going to rehash everything that&#39;s going on since I&#39;m sure most
readers already already know what&#39;s going on but I&#39;ll add one
thing. Many New York teachers need ongoing professional development -
CTLE hours. It seems that teachers in specific programs like New York
City&#39;s Software Engineering Pilot (SEP) have a number of PD
opportunities provided to them and there also seems to be a good
amount of PD at the entry level.
</p>
<p>
There doesn&#39;t seem to be much for the teacher ready for that next
step.
</p>
<p>
To address this, we&#39;ll be offering once a month sessions through
Hunter for CS teachers who are ready to move beyond the basics both in
content and pedagogy.
</p>
<p>
The plan is to start some time in October.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime to all the teachers meeting their students tomorrow -
have a great semester!!!!!
