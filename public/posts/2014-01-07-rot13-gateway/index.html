            <p>I&rsquo;ve written before about <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2013/08/07/That_One_Inspirational_Curriculum.html#.UsyYlN_EvZ8">That One Inspirational Curriculum</a> -
the idea that it&rsquo;s not the topic in the syllabus but rather what the
teacher does with it.</p>
<p>Some times a simple problem can lead to some really neat concepts.</p>
<p>Take what we did in my AP classes over the past couple of days.</p>
<p>I wanted a nice little warm up after the break so we wrote a simple
<a href="http://www.rot-n.com/">rotation cipher</a>. We started with a little
encode routine - take a string and rotate the letters by some
offset. For example if we use an offset of 3, &lsquo;hello&rsquo; becomes
&lsquo;khoor&rsquo; - each letter being shifted over thee places.</p>
<p>Pretty easy for the class but even a simple problem like this lets us
talk about a few things, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>we can exploit the ASCII ordering but have to remember to deal with
the offsets. That is in ASCII, an  &lsquo;a&rsquo; is 97, we can&rsquo;t just calculate c =
(c+offset)%26. We have to first shift the letter down to 0, add and
mod, and then shift back c = ((c-&lsquo;a&rsquo;) +offset)%26 + &lsquo;a&rsquo;</li>
<li>We can talk about neat Internet history such as how
(rot13)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13] was used to hide
spoilers and offensive material on the internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>I then ran a program that broke the encryption. I also showed the
students how it didn&rsquo;t work on single words but did on full sentences.</p>
<p>By hand, decodingn even a simple cipher is a pain.</p>
<p>With computer assist, it&rsquo;s easy - just print out all 26 possible rotations and pull out the right one.</p>
<p>Our question was how do we have the computer do it all on its own?</p>
<p>I asked them to think about how they might write a program to
accomplish this &ndash; and that&rsquo;s when the magic starts.</p>
<p>They came up with a few interesting ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>For each of the 26 rotations, choose the one with the most vowels.</li>
<li>For each word in each rotation, give a point for each word with a vowel and choose the rotation with the highest score.</li>
<li>Look for common short words in each rotation and then check other words against a dictionary.</li>
<li>Do the letters appear with the same frequencies as in the English language</li>
</ol>
<p>We noticed that all of these suggestions are based on our knowledge of
English. What if the message was in a different language or even a
different alphabet?</p>
<p>We decided to use choice 4 - the letter frequencies.</p>
<p><strong>Magic part 1 - using known data to figure out a pattern for unknown data</strong></p>
<p>Even if we don&rsquo;t know the frequencies, if we can get a sample document in our language, we can figure them out. We downloaded a text from Project Gutenberg and used it to build
an array of 26 elements called <em>CorpusFreqs</em>. CorpusFreqs[0] would hold the
frequency of the letter &lsquo;a&rsquo; in our sample document (that is, how many
times &lsquo;a&rsquo; appears over the total number of letters in our document),
CorpusFreqs[1] the frequency of &lsquo;b&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p>Now we have a model that we can use to compare our rotations to.</p>
<p><strong>Magic part 2 - wow, that 9th grade math is actually useful</strong></p>
<p>At this point, it usually isn&rsquo;t clear how to compare our rotations to
the model frequencies we calculated. Time to simplify,</p>
<p>We can look at another problem: Selecting a house.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong>  if we can only have one criteria, what would it be?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Class:</strong> Neighborhood</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Ok, let&rsquo;s rate each neighborhood between 0 and 100</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> We can draw two houses on a line, which is better?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Class:</strong> The one with the larger value!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> What if we add a third house? Which is it more similar to?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Class:</strong> The one it&rsquo;s closer to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Well, what if we add another feature? Cost - let&rsquo;s map low cost to 100 and high cost to 0 and all the other costs in between.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> If we want to visualize a house, how can we do it?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Class:</strong> We can use a graph - like x,y points use location,cost points.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we do it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> This is the least desirable house (0,0) and this is the best one (1,1).
I plot two houses and ask</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Which is more desirable?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Class:</strong> That one (they indicate the one closer to 1,1).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> How can you tell</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Class:</strong> It&rsquo;s closer</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> How do we figure it out?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Class:</strong> The Distance Formula!!!!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now we add a third feature - size. It&rsquo;s pretty easy to show that
the distance formula extends to three-space and in fact to even higher
dimensions.</p>
<p><strong>Magic part 3 - from 3 dimensions to 26</strong></p>
<p>So now, we bring it back to our cipher. For the house example, we used
points in 1,2, and 3 dimensions (and we actually talked about it in
4D) so we used 1 through 4-space vectors to represent the points and
used Euclidean distance formula to see what houses were similar to
each other, or what points where near to each other</p>
<p>From there, it&rsquo;s easy to see that the frequency array we built from ou sample text is a
26-space vector and that we can build a similar vector for each
rotation.</p>
<p>From there we can use the distance formula to see how close each
rotation is to the sample document vector. The rotation with the
closest vector is pobably our solution.</p>
<p>So from a simple warm up problem we&rsquo;re at the gateway to some serious techniques that will come back time and time again as the students move through their CS education and careers.</p>
<p>Fun!</p>
