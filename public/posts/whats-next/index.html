This question appeared on Facebook a few days ago:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Does anyone have an effective way to teach students how to break down
a problem into steps and then solve each step one by one? I think my
students are struggling with a large question and breaking it in
subsequent parts.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There were some good suggestions. I wanted to add something but didn&#39;t
have time then so I thought I&#39;d write it up now.
</p>
<p>
As an aside, it took me forever to find the post again over on
Facebook. If there&#39;s a way to mark posts or save a direct link I&#39;d
love to hear it. I had to look through all the CS Ed groups I belong
to manually until I found it again.
</p>
<p>
When I read the program I was reminded of a PD session we had to
attend back at Stuyvesant. Back then the fad was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_across_the_curriculum">Writing Across the
Curriculum</a>. Every teacher in every class was to give some significant
writing assignment, evaluate it and provide feedback. Let&#39;s forget the
fact that most of us never had any training or preparation to do so.
</p>
<p>
On that PD day the guest speaker was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Zinsser">William Zinsser</a>. The first thing
he said was that what we were being asked to do by our principal was
bunk. He then proceeded to give advice on  simple good writing.
</p>
<p>
The procedure he recommended following was to ask yourself (or have
the student ask themselves) &#34;what does my audience need to know next?&#34;
That&#39;s your next sentence. Then ask the question again. Rinse and
repeat until done.
</p>
<p>
It was simple and it made sense. It also applied to introductory CS
problems. When starting out, students have a limited CS / programming
tool box so a good question for them to ask when trying to solve a
problem is not only &#34;what do I need to do next? but also &#34;what can I
do next?&#34;
</p>
<p>
When students have a limited CS vocabulary and set of idioms - loops,
conditionals, functions, whatever, there will only be so many things
they can do to move a problem along. If they go through the things the
<strong><strong>can</strong></strong> do they will likely fall on to what they <strong><strong>should</strong></strong> do.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s similar to doing a proof in geometry. Students have a set of
givens. Given that set, what can they do? They only know so many
theorems at the beginning.
</p>
<p>
Over time, they&#39;ll recognize patterns and develop as problem solvers.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re part of the AP CS A teachers facebook group you probably saw
the question. Many good answers were posted. I just wanted to add this
thought to the collection.
