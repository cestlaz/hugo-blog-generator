</p>
<p>
This called to mind those countless discussions about tools being user
friendly. I&#39;m frequently on the unpopular side of these
discussions. Linux vs Windows vs Mac, Shell vs GUI, Emacs vs
fill-in-the-blank-editor-or-IDE and on and on.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t use Emacs, it isn&#39;t user
friendly. Don&#39;t use Linux, it isn&#39;t user friendly.
</p>
<p>
The thing is, I don&#39;t think that word means what they think it does.
</p>
<p>
I tell my kids that Linux and the shell is amazingly user friendly and
Windows and Macs aren&#39;t user friendly at all. Windows, rather, is
&#34;Learner Friendly.&#34; For years, it&#39;s been easy to learn what you can do
on Windows or Mac (as used via the GUI, not dropping to a shell) but
the truth is you can&#39;t do that much. They&#39;re designed as program
loaders not tool kits.
</p>
<p>
You can learn how to get around and load programs and files very
quickly - much more quickly at first than using a command line
interface. The problem is, at that point, you hit a wall. No doubt
those operating systems are more learner friendly than Linux and the
shell but once you learn the command line, it can be leveraged for all
sorts of things and pretty easily at that - user friendly (see these
posts for some examples: <a href="http://localhost:8000/categories/cli/">Shell posts</a>).
</p>
<p>
This is important because we have our students use all sorts of tools
and we should be thinking about things like usability but we really
should be thinking about them a little differently.
</p>
<p>
First, is it learner friendly. Part of this is cost of
entry. Linux has a high cost of entry. On the other hand, while Emacs
might look uglier than other modern editors, the cost of entry is
pretty much the same as any other editor - click or type a command and then you can use
the mouse and drop down menus to get started. Vim, in my opinion, on
the other hand has a higher cost of entry due to its modal nature.
</p>
<p>
So, there&#39;s no reason not to use Emacs (vs another editor) but you
might pause before using Linux. My approach is to start as if it were
Windows - use the gui, icons and menus, and then slowly introduce the
command line.
</p>
<p>
Once your past the cost of entry, the we can think about being learner
friendly. As I mentioned, Linux, not so much. Emacs, sure - just like
any other editor with drop downs that then give you keyboard
equivalents.
</p>
<p>
The keyboard equivalents lead us to another part of learner friendly
– discoverability - can you easily discover new things about the
tool. Here Emacs shines. Linux, maybe not so much.
</p>
<p>
Once past learner friendly we get to user friendly. The core question
is &#34;can I do what I need to and want to do easily.&#34; For most people, it
comes down to - the tool I know is user friendly and the one I don&#39;t
know and don&#39;t want to take the time to know isn&#39;t. There are some
things that are cumbersome no matter what, but really, when we say
user friendly, most people mean &#34;what I like.&#34; To me, it&#39;s a little
more - is the tool expressive and powerful as well.
</p>
<p>
So, why is this important? First, we shouldn&#39;t allow our biases to
color the way we expose our kids to tools but at the same time, we
should pay attention to learnability, cost of entry, discoverability,
and indeed, true user friendliness.

<p>
So, let&#39;s stop with this &#34;your tool isn&#39;t easy to use&#34; nonsense. Any
tool we don&#39;t know isn&#39;t easy to use until we learn it. Let&#39;s focus on
the path to learning the useful ones.
