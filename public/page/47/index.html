    <div class="content post-summary">
        div.center {text-align:center;}   Almost twenty six years. That's how long I've been a NYC public school teacher. Most of that time at my alma mater, Stuyvesant.  A couple of years ago, the school paper wrote up an overview of my career. I re-posted it here. I'm somtimes amazed at where we are now and how we got here.  Regulars here also know my frustrations. To Stuy, I'm an interchangeable, generic math teacher and the DOE has shown no interested in supporting what we've built.

We spend an inordinate amount of time trying to see the problem and then realize that we just forgot something silly.  At this point, it's common for us CS teachers to tell each other "

You can read more about it here.  I came to the party a little late so I'm only up to day 6.  Each problem comes in two parts. The second is revealed after you complete the first.

Of course, everyone whooping it up now was quick to say "all those rankings are meaningless"

It turns out that Natan's last class of the day is Music Composition.  Here's what followed:  Natan:    Composition is in the bell tower on Central.

        The StuyCS Family mailing list was host to an interesting discussion today. One of our younger members asked if the practice of giving technical problems during an interview was going to follow him throughout his career or if it goes away for more senior applicants.  An interesting discussion followed.  It reminded me of a time I was talking to a few senior engineers at a large tech company.

        div.center {text-align:center;}    Today was a "professional development day." That means that instead of teaching, we were supposed to work on our craft.

Basically, it was a bunch of CS teachers from two schools - Stuy and Brooklyn Tech, talking shop for most of the day.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   As a teacher, sometimes your gut tells you to do something and it turns out to be a really good idea.  That's what happened in October, 1994. I decided to dress up as Groo the Wanderer for Halloween. I never dressed in costume for school before and back then, no many did. A few students and very few teachers.  Afterwards, I noticed that my younger students - the ones that didn't know me that well yet, really loosened up and so a tradition was born.
