        div.center {text-align:center;}   Funny story from yesterday.  Devorah, my better half, is an assistant principal at another high school. Yesterday evening, she was at work late for "curriculum night." Parents came to the school after hours to hear a variety of presentations.  During her presentation, Devorah mentioned her name, that she had two former public school kids in college, and that's about it for the personal info.

        div.center {text-align:center;}     Today we kicked off Hacking Sessions 2015. Saturday morning with sixty kids in a room brainstorming ideas. Soon they'll settle on teams and projects and we'll be off for a semester of exploring CS and tech.  The next couple of weeks will be a little chaotic with groups shifting, mentors figuring out which groups to work with and us, the instructors launching each team on its way.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   I was brought up on Gilberg and Sullvan. My father, who always wanted to be an opera singer sang with LOOM back in the day and there was always classical music playing. Either from the Hi Fi or my father singing.  Recently, there's been a kerfufle over what was to be NYGASP's production of Mikado.  My son, Natan wrote a terrific blog post on it and the suspension of belief in opera.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        div.center {text-align:center;}    Earlier this week, Mayor Bill deBlasio announced some ambitious CS Education Plans for NYC. I posted a response here. Now that a few days past, I thought I'd clear a few things up.  First and foremost, I hope my concerns are unfounded and I hope the plan is a tremendous success.  What's got me bummed is not that I need to see my name in lights given that in many ways I've been a CS Ed trailblazer (although who doesn't like a little ego stroking), rather that in my humble opinion NY has squandered a great opportunity and resource and as a results, kids won't get nearly all they could.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   The NY Times just posted an article - the mayor announced a 10 year deadline by which time all NYC public school students will be taking CS.  I should be happy.  I'm not.  I feel thoroughly defeated.  As many of you know, I've struggled for years to try to bring CS education to more kids and to train more teachers. You also probably know that over the years, I've become pretty good at this.

I've been at the CS Ed game for a long time.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        div.center {text-align:center;}    We talked about setting kids up to fail in math. What about CS?  Well, it's a little subtler.  I started thinking about this after a conversation with one of my graduates about Harvard's famous CS50. Since that conversation, I've spoken to a number of my kids that have gone through CS50 and most seem to say the same things: They don't really teach anything  The kids rely on a group member who already knows stuff or will learn all the stuff on their own  If it weren't for my StuyCS background my group would have really struggled.

The reason why these schools aren't offering Algebra 2 is very simple - the kids aren't ready for it.

They'd thank me, tell me how exited their child was every day, how proud they were of what they were learning and on and on.
