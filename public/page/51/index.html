    <div class="content post-summary">
        div.center {text-align:center;}   The other day, Fred Wilson sent out a short tweet storm turned post on determining if an entrepreneur's startup idea is a good one. It's short. Take a minute to read it over.  At its core, the post and the comments talk about belief in an idea and it got me thinking about some things as an educator.  Tweet 7:   and you have to believe in yourself and your idea or nobody else ever will   resonated with me, not just in terms of a startup idea, but with respect to one's passion.

        div.center {text-align:center;}    I'm a born and bred New Yorker and more and more I'm lamenting what the city's becoming.  New York used to be a collection of neighborhoods. Yes, we were the city that never slept, but there were scores of mom and pop stores, sole proprieterships. You could become a "regular." I'm reminded of Tom Shachman's book Around the Block which looks at the businesses around a single NYC block, mostly all gone now.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   When starting the spring semester, students are frequently a little rusty. They just had a high intensity month of study, tests, and projects. That was followed by a week of nothing.  I like to start with something lightweight that gets them coding again and ramps them up to speed.  In SoftDev I started with a brief overview of the HTML5 canvas and then gave them a small homework assignment to do something fun.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   Yesterday, I took part in a round table discussion on Ed Tech and Tech Ed, the latter being more, as they say, my wheelhouse. Afterwards a few of us were chatting and a friend observed that when she first started to talk to high school kids she was shocked that they really didn't know the local tech players - neither names nor companies.  A couple of years ago, another friend was helping me organize an event for high schoolers.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   I just read Alfred Thompson's predictions for next year. I was going to leave a comment but since it would have gotten somewhat long winded, I thought I'd comment in a post of my own.  If you haven't read Alfred's post yet, check it out: http://blog.acthompson.net/2015/01/computer-science-education-predictions.html On more states allowing CS to count for a graduation requirement:  Alfred's probably right but I'm leery. Sure, it could end up terrific but I could see a number of ways this could play out badly.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   In a recent post, Alfred Thompson referred to an earlier post where he mentioned rock star CS teachers. That's a term I've heard thrown around a lot in the past few years. I've heard some of my graduates referred to as rock stars - top tech people, and in fact I've seen some of them courted for positions in a manner that a rock star might be accustomed to.
