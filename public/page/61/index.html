        Piloting a new course this semester - Intro to Computer Science part 2. Between the existing Intro part 1 and this, we should be able to do a pretty thorough job in preparing our kids for the future.
We decided that we wanted the kids to make deliverables in the form of web pages - plain old html written by hand. Part of the idea was to demystify things, part was to let the kids show off their work, part was to have something that they can generate programatically as the course progressed, and part was to give them a tool they might find valuable beyond their computer science classes.

        I've been mostly underwater for the last couple of weeks.
End of term issues combined with the Academy of Software Engineering announcement has pretty much eaten up all of my out of class time.
It's going to be a week or so before I can finish writing the posts I was planning on, but it looks like a storm is brewing around Stuyvesant and Computer Science so I thought I'd put up this short semi-related post.

        Fred Wilson and me at #SOTC2012Last week I was given the honor of attending the State of the City address. The mayor was announcing a new school for the fall. An Academy for Software Engineering. This has been in the works for a while and has a long way to go but the announcement was a major step. The project really got its start a couple of years ago. I'd been working hard for years prior trying to get the city to help me grow the program I developed at Stuyvesant, but until Fred got involved, there was no movement.

        I've always lamented the fact that we don't have the time or structure to really teach our kids to program.
In their early classes, they learn syntax, algorithms, and &nbsp;some ways of storing data and while they &nbsp;will probably work on some larger projects as they study CS, kids seem to be mostly left on their own in terms of how to take a project from problem or idea to completion.

        Now that the ML and AI courses are at an end, here are some of the things I would do moving forward.
Both courses already have a basic track where students just watch the lectures and do the in lecture quizzes and an advanced track where students also complete weekly assignments. I think we can be certain that there were students who just watched a few lectures, many who completed every assignment, and those who fell at all points in between.

        This is the first in a three part series.
Part 1 talks about my take on how the courses were presented.
in Part 2, I'll discuss my take on how to improve the experience
and finally, in part 3, we'll look at on line education with an emphasis on the high school market.
 
 
 
As some of you know, I've been taking the on line Machine Learning andArtificial Intelligence courses offered by Stanford this semester.

        Ok, it's a word search.
We're always looking for interesting applications to build lessons around. Over the years, I've tried different things when teaching 2 dimensional arrays. Simple game boards, representing a crossword puzzle, tables of various sorts, etc.
This year,&nbsp;JonAlf, one of my amazingly talented colleagues,&nbsp;decided to go with building a word search. I decided to steal the idea. It's a great one.
I thought I'd use this post to go through the project and why I like it.

        A couple of weeks ago, I attended the K-12 workshop at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing Conference. It was great to reconnect with some old friends, make some new ones, and talk shop for the weekend.
One result was that I promised to start blogging again.
I've got a number of ideas for posts lined up. Some on pedagogy, some technical, and some cultural. Hope you enjoy them.

        Now for the rest of the trip.
Rome to Little Falls
We had some trouble getting out of Rome. As always, once we're on trail, it's pretty easy to follow, but entering and leaving towns and cities, with the exceptions of canal side towns like Lockport, can be a challenge. During the day, we found that we could either follow the official Erie Canal Trail signs or the pink trail blazes painted on the streets for the Erie Canal Tour (that preceded us by a week).
