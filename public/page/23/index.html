        AFSE stands for the Academy for Software Engineering. It&#39;s a public school in New York City with a stated focus on, well, software engineering. I have some history with the school and its creation but that&#39;s not what this post is about. In fact, this post isn&#39;t really about AFSE at all. I plan to neither praise or critique the school. This is about what Bill Gates wrote about his recent visit.

        Yesterday, Alfred Thompson asked &#34;Why is it important for CS students to understand binary?&#34; on Twitter which led to a number of interesting responses. Alfred summarized and wrote his own thoughts on his blog.  I wanted to add a comment but I already wrote a post for yesterday so put it off until today.  First let me say that you can have a very successful career in tech and not really know binary or number bases other than 10.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        Today was the first day of school for all NYC teachers. Students come back tomorrow. That&#39;s a quick turnaround. Some years, they get a day or two before the kids come in. That&#39;s much easier.  The first day is usually dominated by meetings. In a large school like Stuy you&#39;ll typically have a long faculty meeting in the morning and a department meeting in the afternoon. Not much time to actually get ready for classes.

        Classes started up again today so I thought I&#39;d talk about my class rules.  I don&#39;t seem to recall many class rules in college. Sure, there was a grading policy governing homework and the like but not much beyond that. In K12 there are usually more. When you can talk, how you set up your notebook, how to do homework, bathroom policy etc.  For years, I&#39;ve used the same set of class rules and I always talk about the rules with my classes.

        Earlier today I was asked about my avatar:  I&#39;ve been using it for most services for a few months now. It&#39;s an image that I&#39;ve had for ages. I started thinking about using it about a year ago  So, what&#39;s the story?  It was back in 1993. I had just started at Stuy. I taught some CS when I was at Seward Park but at the time, I was teaching all math at Stuy.

        Writing about old projects got me thinking of my first programming gig and software longevity. It was a part time after school / full time summer job at Arcus-Simplex-Brown. I started in my senior year in high school and continued through most of my first year in college. It wasn&#39;t my first job - that was being a delivery boy at Video Room, an independent video store that&#39;s survived from the old VHS/Betamax days through DVDs and is still, somehow or other, surviving in this day and age of streaming video.

        JCS&#39;s post on Irreal today brought me back. It was about Brief which was the editing hotness back in the day. I played with it a little really mostly used Emacs clones for real work when I was stuck on MS-DOS systems. Usually either JOVE or Epsilon  In the comments Jon reminded me about the MKS Toolkit which brought most everyday Unix tools to DOS along with a shell and a version of Vi.

        I&#39;ve been following the tweets coming out of ICER2018. I&#39;ve never been to ICER but now am thinking about trying to get funding to go next year. One set of tweets involved students writing or using APIs or Libraries. This overlaps with Owen Astrachan&#39;s talk from this past year&#39;s CSTA conference on sorting. I was planning on writing a post about Owen&#39;s talk but I thought I&#39;d leave it for the school year closer to when sorting is typically covered.

        Right now I&#39;m on vacation in Harrogate England. Natan is here taking part in the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival so Devorah and I came along as tourists. Today we went to Knaresborough:   The River Nidd as seen from Knaresborough Castle    Normally when traveling I try to get everything in and that leaves me pretty exhausted at the end of each day. Since this time we&#39;ll be here for around two weeks, I&#39;m trying a less hectic pace.

        It&#39;s August 3rd and I&#39;ve been giving a lot of thought to the start of the semester. Normally I wouldn&#39;t think about the Fall term this early. While I&#39;ve been working on and off since last semester ended, I don&#39;t officially &#34;go back&#34; until August 23rd with classes starting on the 27th. The difference is that for the first time in forever we&#39;re taking a longish trip between now and then.
