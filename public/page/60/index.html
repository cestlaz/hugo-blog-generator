    <div class="content post-summary">
        I&rsquo;ve never been a huge fan of the way we do varsity sports, and I say this as a guy that coached for a number of years. In NYC, we&rsquo;re governed by the Public School Athletic League or PSAL. Practice time and lack of facilities make teaching difficult, but my biggest problem is the fact that most teams cut, that is, if you&rsquo;re not in the top &ldquo;n,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re out. So, if our basketball team has, let&rsquo;s say 15 kids on it, they get exclusive use of the gym every afternoon during basketball season and no one else can receive coaching or be part of the team.

        The day before Thanksgiving is always fun. For as long as I can remember, recent graduates descend upon Stuy. For the most part, they mull around the senior bar but we get our share up in 301.
This year was a little quiet but I got to see more than my share of graduates over the weekend as I attended the 2002 and 2007 class reunions. I&rsquo;ve only been invited to a handful of reunions and really consider it an honor when I am.

        On going back to work today Since school was still out due to Sandy, we ran a second online class yesterday. At the end of the session, which I&rsquo;ll summarize below, I told the class what I wanted them to accomplish today and over the weekend. One student queried &ldquo;you mean no class on Friday :-(?&rdquo; Alas no &ndash; while students aren&rsquo;t reporting to school this morning, teachers are.
Of course the logic as to why is far from sound.

        Here's what the bridge leading across the West Side Highway over to Stuy during the storm. Hence the title with the weak tech reference.  The storm has kept the schools closed all week so it's as good a time as any to try to resurrect this blog.  As you can see, I've moved from blogger to a Jekyll based blog hosted on Github. I'm really liking the way it works but more on that at a later date.

        Sorry for the weak title and movie reference.
It's teacher appreciation week -- one of our lesser celebrated weeks. I'm waiting for the annual letter we get from the chancellor. Given the level of teacher bashing over the last few years, I've recently found their emails amusing.
I though I'd take the time to thank a few of my most influential teachers. To paraphrase: whatever good I've been able to do, it has been because I have stood on the shoulders of giants.

        Shortly after our event at Foursquare, I was chatting with Kevin Friedman (Stuy '96). Kevin's startup is Cojourneo&nbsp;and since it has an educational bent, he thought I might be interested in hearing about it.
I certainly was.
Rather than visiting Kevin, I thought it would be fun to have him come down after school, present Cojourneo to any students that wanted to stay late and then field questions.
Cojourneo is an interesting product.

        Anyone can cook - Chef Gusteau
These days the rage seems anyone can code.
On line attempts to teach coding and computing abound.
We've got Udacity and Coursera trying to bring college level academic offerings to the masses on one extreme and more down to earth "learn to code" efforts with Codecademy getting the most press.
While I applaud any effort to make knowledge more accessible, there are a lot of unanswered questions as to the effectiveness of these latest attempts.

        When kids are knee deep in nlog(n) algorithms and working on recursion, it's easy to lose track of the amazingly neat things that are right around the corner for them.
I've recently been working on organizing our Stuyvesant Computer Science alumni network and am putting together a page with some of the places our graduates work&nbsp;here.
It can be hard to see how one goes from sorting and searching in Java to working at places like Google, or FourSqurare or creating your own startup like DigitalOcean, Usable Health,&nbsp;TimeHop, or PropHop.

Instead of having a typical lab type periods, we tried the Pair Programming Tag Team Shootout.
We aren't annualized so while the kids that have been with me since September have been working in pairs for a while, the other half of the class is just getting used to how we do it. I also wanted to get the kids to mix a little more.
