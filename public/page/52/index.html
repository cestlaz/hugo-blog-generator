        div.center {text-align:center;}   I've said it many times:   Never use a tool you couldn't write yourself.   That is - make sure you understand what's going on under the hood.  In AP we've been playing with ArrayLists. The problem for today? Create an ArrayList with consecutive integers and then write a routine that will randomize the ArrayList.  For example, you might start with this ArrayList: 0,1,2,3,4,5   and end up with 3,5,1,4,2,0   First cut, the students grabbed a random element from the ArrayList, removed it, and added it to the end of a new list.

Even better was the time I was at the wedding of two former students. I had just dropped around 65 pounds and was wearing my hair differently. I sat at a table filled with former students that didn't recognize me &#x2013; they had no reason to expect me, out of context and all.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        div.center {text-align:center;}    How many times do we teach something and leave the kids thinking:  "what's the point of this?" "When will I use this?" or even just the plain old fashioned "that's weird."  It's pretty cool when a lesson starts out that way but you get to the payoff by the end of the class.  Today we started exploring some advanced python.  We started by showing that you can assign functions to variables or pass them as parameters: def inc(x): return x+1 def dec(x): return x-1 f = inc print f(5) flist = [inc,dec] print flist[1](5)    We then looked at closures in python: def makeAdder(n): def inner(x): return x+n return inner add3 = makeAdder(3) add5 = makeAdder(5) print add3(10) print add5(10)    The idea that we can make a function that builds and returns a function.

Traditionally, math team coaches from around the city descend on Stuy for a day full of lectures, discussion, and general catching up. I've never actually attended these meetings. In the past, they were for math team coaches only and this year, I was actually allowed to do something with the CS teachers.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   Earlier today I saw a friend's Facebook post questioning the sanity of common core math. He had an issue with the way his daughter was being forced to work out problems. A few of us chimed in with our low op pinion on Common Core, others said they thought it was a good idea. I think the fact that my buddy was questioning it is a major strike against CC.
